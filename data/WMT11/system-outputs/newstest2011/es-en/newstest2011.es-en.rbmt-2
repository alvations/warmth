What is counted? The in Prague does not know neither to Voldemort neither the pastry shop
The new councilmen of the in the capital are going to have that to surpass, as seems, the evident linguistic barriers so that the components of the Meeting of Prague and of the town Council understand to their renewed companions of the ODS.
The period "examined" to the members of the new Counsel of the to verify its know-how of the tongue marked slang that has arisen in recent years in the Counsel, when they governed Prague the current members of the coalition.
The dictionary codified that utilized the flower and political cream of Prague during the previous period, of the mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the personages, situations and you cause best-known of the metropolises.
Surprisingly, it has been verified that the new councilmen almost do not understand those you known concepts.
At least, that they say.
"¿Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that it do not I know."
"More well I am a novice in the political one praguense," affirmed during the exam of terminology of "colegueo" the councilman of culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And as for the political veteran, equal reacted Karel.
Perhaps they know the concept "pit of golf."
"Possibly it be the only expression of all the ones that you asked me that use occasionally."
"If not, normally not employment slang."
Of the glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper the past June before the congress of voting of the ODS, the editing chose six examples, particularly those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "greater pit of golf of Prague," "to go to the pastry shop," "nape of the neck of bull," "treason of the capital" and "to armor-plate."
Three councilmen accepted to be submitted to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, that in future will be responsible for the education in Prague, at the beginning agreed, but did not catch again the telephone.
The fifth councilman, Petr Dolínek, was denied directly to do it.
"I do not put me in these things neither I think to value how entertain the civic democrats."
"What yes imports is me how will we understand us in the execution of our programs," indicated.
As he has been seen, supposedly the councilman Lukáš Kaucký not itself to have realized that the previous title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
To Kaucký the word "Voldemort" says him nothing; the only term that succeeded in the exam is "the largest pit of golf of Prague."
"It is a matter of the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, that adds immediately: "But more well I know it for the news."
"I am going to have that to aim at a course of languages," jokes.
Karel is not the unique one that recognizes in the pit of golf the tunnel Blanka, but also the councilman of Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý even he knows where to find that personage; besides, he suspects the meaning of "to go to the pastry shop."
"I believe that wants to go to a business of Prague"; quick is watchful to Plachý that is a matter of the headquarters of the businesses of Janoušek.
Just like indicates that such the know-how obtained them of the news, but that does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the sociodemócratas no glossary exists so relative of colloquial terms.
"I asked my companions, but really seems that we do not have anything seemed."
"More well, among us we utilize nicknames, at times abbreviations or we do puns with the names," the president of the praguense says, Petr Hulínský, whose companions of party call Hulda.
"In the school they called me but I do not know if my companions also call me thus," confesses its own nickname Karel.
The newspaper put to test the name and functions.
For its companions of party, Weinert is (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with the one that associated before the elections deceits during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname of ("playmobil") on the part of some of its companions.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that the sociodemócratas tolerate in the speech inside the party.
To Hulínský does not he like that they call him Hulda, but the newspaper discovered even other nicknames for this president praguense.
"The doctor of the rights of the sticks" as seems he recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained its doctorate in Right in the academy of police of Bratislava.
The Government wants to limit the torture of the "witches," as published in a pamphlet
The respected women as the witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are used to having an age advanced, they cannot work, for example, by reasons of health, are single women and do not have children.
The women that themselves "return" witches are sent to a remote zone, so that they damage not to the remainder of the town.
"The men rare time suffer such but."
"Neither itself aísla to the healthy young women, because they help in the works and have children," explains a nun that, in the capital of the state of Africa western Burkina Faso is occupied in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled of its communities.
The local Government has determined to be opposed to this unusual one "social measure."
It emitted an informative pamphlet that should contribute to avoid the witch hunt.
Nevertheless, this has a hits.
"More than the 70% of the adults in Burkina Faso does not know to read," notifies the periodic one Die Standard on the disadvantages of the sensitizing in writing.
The accusations of sorcery are also common in other African countries.
In Desire, neighboring country of Burkina Faso, last week died Ammy Hemmah, of 72 years, when three women and two men tortured it, they coverred with it gasoline and they burned it.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors affirm that themselves due to an unfortunate accumulation of circumstances.
According to his version, the woman was lit in the oil that is utilized for the anointings rituals.
It was lit in flames when the group wanted "to expel to the bad spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "witches" support it people of all the educational levels.
The periodic one Der Standard cited a businessman of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The devouring of human souls always represented a danger," affirmed.
While in Burkina Faso the Government tries to appease the witch hunt, in Gambia last year still participated in her the president.
"The president gambiano Jammeh, after the death of their aunt, launched an extensive hunt of the witches that, supposedly, they had been related to their death and they had tried to kill the own president by means of the black magic."
"To help him brought to chamanes of the nearby one Guinea that, protected by police officers, military and the personal escort of the president, they were carried by force to men and women chosen randomly among the towns gambianos to the property of the president in Kanilai," indicates in its report the organization Amnesty International.
In the farm, the people arrested had to be drunk a potion of hallucinogenic effective herbs that, besides, caused them renal and intestinal problems.
Two of them they arrested did not survive the stay in the farm.
After the international pressure, finally they freed to around thousand detained people.
The boarder of Bakala: is heated with stoves of coal and firm a higher rent
The man, of age advanced and strong, crossed the doors of the center of customer service of the business RPG Byty of the "magnate of the coal" Bakala, the major private owner of flats in rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm carried some documents with the new three-floor leases: his, that of its daughter and that of its son, that is complying sentence.
To the three the liberalization of the rents has just caught them.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns monthly, the son will pay from the next year 4,100 crowns by a flat of two stays with next best kitchen separated.
"Besides, does not it have hot water and the heating is based on a kettle of solid fuel," sample with the finger the man in the new contract of its son, on whose firm has full powers.
"But I signed it," explains medium, angry middle resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, that qualified the new conditions of rent as "incorrect and indecent," recommends the boarders that do not sign the new contracts and that expect to December 7, date in which will publish a guide reporting on how proceed in these cases.
But, before this, the so alone man does a gesture.
"Each which a thing he says," he says with expensive evil.
Ostrava is becoming a great laboratory of tests of the liberalization.
After New Year will occur with the great majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, they were up to now under a regular rent.
Therefore, it decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The mining waiting room of RPG is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday at nine o'clock, already was full.
Just next to the doors they are the security guards and to their side a machine to catch number.
"Rent 2011," can be read in a luminous button of its touch screen.
Upon pressing it, the machine leaves a minor role with a number.
Almost does not it give time neither to read "157" and already the number appears in the great screen situated in the high thing of the room.
In a second, you are in the queue.
Shortly after, a marriage of age advanced arrives to ask, but the crowd of the room is not here by the new rents.
The majority of the people comes to solve habitual problems, as old: requests of arrangements, questions of the insurance and similar matters.
The letters with the new leases will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the boarders of the majority of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty proposes them in the letters an increase of the rent from among the 15 and the 38%.
November 18 a special window in the center of customer service for the new rents is opened.
"It carries functioning a week, so is beginning," they respond, after doubting briefly, the workers that are found in her when the client is presented like the journalist.
The liberalization and the old flats for miners of Bakala are the most delicate themes in the zone.
Before the elections, already treated them high and clearly the vice president of the Parliament, native of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the zone.
"Twenty years later I want a new floor."
"Neither they changed me the damned dish of the bath," the man mentioned in the introduction is relieved.
According to the workers, for the moment they come most of all retired to verify if they receive a discount in the rent if they sign to time, as promises the special offering of RPG.
They will receive likewise the half of the discount on the rent of February the remaining boarders that sign the new contract before December 15.
Nevertheless, the window of the "liberalization" mining without doubt fails to dissipate the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 clients that were here yesterday, only they asked for the rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people," esteem the employee of the window.
In the meantime, RPG proposes in the web and in its boards to carry out individual meetings on the contracts when necessary.
If the two parts do not arrive at an agreement on the rent, should solve the question an independent judge.
"Does not it be a matter of a threat, but of information on the possible only way to proceed and completely according to the law," notifies RPG in its pages.
"Here himself is going to judge nobody," thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man that is found on the street set against the center of customer service he gives him, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and 5,000 for the food they remain myself; I do not have media to respond to the courts," affirms.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"Already we will see."
"The Mister Zaorálek notifies them in the media that they sign not, so perhaps the people expect," thinks.
The regulation of the rent to will stop existing in the majority of the Czech Republic to starts of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic need.
"The current rents do not yet cover not even the necessary amounts for the maintenance of the bottom of the community," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential accounts receivable of the business RPG Byty, that adds that the careless state of the bottom of the community that annoyance to the boarders is, for the owners, the main reason to enlarge the rent.
While during the five years that elapsed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able with the rents to invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that Iran from 2011 to 2014 the figure will enlarge to 5,200 million.
The great screen that cluster of the ceiling, set against the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that stand out in red.
"The increase of the rent in the year 2011 in a 15% and except applies to 31,200 apartments, that is to say, more than the 90% of the properties of RPG."
"Besides, always it will be at most 7.50 monthly Czech crowns by square meter," is indicated in the screen.
Only increase in a 38% the 400-floor rent of the accounts receivable of RPG.
"In such cases, is a matter of an increase since some extremely low quantities, of 19.66 crowns by square meter," indicates RPG.
In 2,600 flats, the rent will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect of blow to the rents, but will be scaled among four to eight years.
Besides, it adds the following commitment: the business will invest all the money of the ascent of the rent (consult the graphic) again in the flats, chiefly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
They will take precedence the people that sign the rent ascent agreement.
The architects have understood that the offices also need preschool
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the business Arch.Design.
Nobody would say that he hides also in his interior a small preschool with all the own thing to such installations: walls of colors, creative and even one furniture park in miniature in the exterior terrace.
From October of last year, they can respond to her the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The business of architectural projects Arch.Design, of whose study you left numerous known buildings of Brno, thought since the first sketchs of the building Avriopoint in including a space for its miniguardería.
In the business they work around 90 people, chiefly in the age of the baby boom and they wanted to permit that the architects and draftsmen could return soon at work after the maternity.
Along with the possibility to enjoy a schedule reduced, the preschool is one of the benefits that offers Arch.Design to its workers in the framework of its social program.
The construction companies and architects in this way have the possibility to combine an exacting profession with the care of the children.
The miniguardería was an idea of the own employees of Arch.Designu and, with the support of the direction, they managed to obtain financing of the European Union and of the Department of Labor and Social Matters.
The miniguardería of the business is financed through the European Social Fund in the framework of the operating Program of human resources and employment, as well as of the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (an endowment of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) could buy the equipment and, after two years, to hire personnel qualified and services.
When it exhaust the financing (two years), the business Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain in operation the miniguardería with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and in the presentation of the request of financing contributed the business Economy Rating.
The attention of the children is in the hands of personnel qualified; besides, they been present all the day for their cares a nurse and a teacher of the Department of Education. The preschool at present receives unlimited children of age, although the majority of them has less than three years.
It given that is a matter of a "miniguardería," so alone can receive simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the shifts they respond more during the day.
The operation of the preschool is flexible to be adapted to the needs of the parents and the children of all the workers have the same right to utilize the preschool, independently of the hierarchy inside the business.
Although is a matter of a teaching and individual cares, the contents of the program of the miniguardería are comparable to the program of the habitual preschool teaching.
In her the not alone children play, but also they receive a teaching of quality: since the basic learning to the preparation for the school, they teach to English.
The not alone class has toys and board games, but also of a computer for the children.
The presence of small children in the own business to create a positive and friendly environment.
The parents can be going to see its children at any moment and they avoid the stress to collect late to the children of the school when is found far from its place of work.
Thus, the parents are more productive while they work.
Does not it turn out to be surprising that this generate of natural form a relation of loyalty between the worker and its employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is situated among the businesses they sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in final, this program reinforced the marketing of personnel.
The house of the bones continues fascinating after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof the back of a lizard seems prehistórico, the stairs recall to the column of a dinosaur and the balconies seem the mouth of an open fish.
Thus is the House Batlló, in Barcelona, of the Catalonian architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to their similar form to a skeleton, the localities nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Its organic forms, its gaudy colors, the novel utilization of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that recalls to the scales and the omnipresent lines gently curvadas, all it is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The cover sheet of the house he plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures removed of the nature and of the fauna.
Lending more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and an order is observed carefully thought.
At night, all the facade of the house seems still more impressive, since is visionary of such way that improve the shine of the colors.
It winds and the twisting of the forms continues us surprising also in its interior.
The wood wavy copy the frameworks of the windows, the banisters, the decorations of the doors, the peepholes and the signs.
The House Batlló, that is found in the neighborhood of Eixample in the number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig of Grácia, he arose of the restructuring of a house of the year 1877 of the architect Emilio Room Cortez.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrialist Josep Batlló, initially he insisted on knocking down the previous building and to start from scratch, but soon he accepted the idea of Gaudí of carrying out a cheaper and novel reconstruction.
Nevertheless, the House Batlló, formed by diverse apartments, it did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
It collaborated in the design the architect Josep María Jujol.
In fact, in their plans of the project decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property they arose and the mosaics utilized in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
The contribution in the proposals of the House Batlló was the start of the successful contribution of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House Milá and of the park Güell of Gaudí, in which other pieces of the same one are found.
Due to their organic form, the localities shortly after their finalización nicknamed it "the house of the bones."
Other, due to the specific mechanism of opening of the windows they began to call it "the house of the yawns."
He is said also that, in the high thing of the construction, the sword of San appears Jorge, boss of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motives.
Gaudí projected in the house an unique system for the epoch of central heating with vents of ventilation and the typical chimneys.
Its inclination of forty-five degrees can turn out to be strange.
During the construction, Gaudí did not respect at all the norms of construction of the moment and was not left to influence for them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission since the principle, although evidently in it the data indicated on the predicted reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, to its finalización, the City Hall remained so impacted with the result that asked that be to corrected.
It bothered him, for example, that the construction to include columns even to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements never were carried out, more well to the contrary: so alone fifteen days after the request of the City Hall, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest flats of the building.
In the ground floors the own owner was installed.
In the gallery of the second flat the parlor was found and in the third flat the dormitories and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, six-floor, is completely crossed by a stair that carries to the terrace of the roof.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the angles and straight lines, coverring with walls curvados.
Gaudí worked likewise with the modern concept of connection of the space.
The common part can be connected completely opening the doors of the parlors and a greater group can communicate of this way without problems, without renounce the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not alone obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional flats.
It turns out to be impressive likewise how plays Gaudí with the light, blue and white tiles that cover the interior patio and skylights.
The play with the two colors contributes the maximum of light in all the flats of the house.
It was based simply in the principle that the white one reflects more light than the dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the rays of sun.
Any person can visit the House Batlló, that in the year 2005 he was added to the list of world patrimony of the humanity of the Unesco.
In the first flat of the house the more reloaded and most spacious apartment of the accessible to the public is found.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, with occasion of the 150º anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or they discovered, that is a matter of a very beneficial business and they expanded the visits to the common zone and to the dormer, included the terrace of the roof.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16.50 euro, although the students, them retired and the holders of the tourist cards obtain a 20% of discount.
The amount surpasses considerably the price of the entrance of other constructions of Gaudí in the city.
If it wants to enjoy the true environment of the bed with its towers of lizard, should make friend quickly of some resident of the neighboring houses and to visit him at home.
How the mattress is chosen and the bedframe: the women and the men seek different things
Nothing of a pompous framework for the bed; what really its quality to a good bed confers is the surface to be fallen, that is to say, the mattress and the bedframe.
Above all they should be complemented to the perfection so that they adapt the concrete users.
During the election numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, state of health and sex of the owner.
Also the type of interior turns out to be important in which the mattress is situated and the bedframe.
A typical example?
For example, in a cabin of weekend that does not be used to having heating, they should not be utilized mattresses of latex because themselves "they heat" more slowly.
Besides, they are used to weighing considerably more than the mattresses of habitual polyurethane.
Consequently, turns out to be necessary to turn around more often.
If themselves not the channels of the center are aired properly and, over, they are found on a base sign, they maintain inside the humidity. Even mold can appear underneath.
At the moment of elect a bed, also they influence the customs.
Who have passed a lot time abroad, often utilizes a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have problems to be felt well in a hard and lower surface.
"Almost all the players of hockey that returned from the NHL complained that here they did not sleep equal of well."
"For its they pounded shoulders, heels and hips needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelástica."
"This type of mattresses they are recommended also for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, for which they receive badly the information of the articulations and of the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, that specializes itself in the furniture quilted.
Many players of hockey, just like other clients, they carry time preferring the mattresses of viscoelástica.
"Today already there is not problem, because they have these adequate Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech mark Tropico."
Already not one must be a player of the NHL to be able to appreciate the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" functions of a very simple way.
It optimizes its inflexibility and form in function of the heat absorbed or adapts to its corporal heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, will not give returns as after a hard party.
Simply, sleeps better.
The viscoelástica also functions like protection against the sores.
Upon choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of around 180 cm will need a bed from among 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, of 90 cm, on the whole 180 cm.
In the case of the single rooms, for example of single, is recommended as a minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
So that a possible visit also be comfortable.
"If not, it can apply a simple norm to calculate the wide one: upon being fallen face up, should have the hands conveniently shrunk toward the elbows," advises the Greek engineer Prokopová, expert of Cechu to that already carries many years being in charge of the problems of the healthy dream and of the ergonomics of the furniture, he fear that he teaches in the schools specialized.
In the double rooms, each one needs its own bedframe and mattress, so during the purchase one must lend attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bedframes to different heights, which always is not possible in all the beds.
The mattresses of foam should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models with interior of springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeter they are for the layer that adapts to the forms and smooths out.
"Upon touching it with the hand or upon being accommodated in the mattress, without doubt they should not be noted the springs," notifies Greek Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a type of specific bedframe.
The dormitories completely quilted, in which the mattress and the base are like Siamese, they make no sense in the dormitory.
The mattresses breathe badly and itself cannot wash its case, which today is done often.
And, it given that each night we perspire between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, is of course after some five or seven years the mattress will begin to recall us to a great (and congested) sieve.
By this reason, the specialists reject the slogans that speak of a life of the mattress of to 25 years or, even, of a guarantee by life.
Nevertheless, all has a but.
Therefore, the salespersons give a counsel: in the mattresses with a wide one of 120 or 140 cm, be occupied carefully of the cleaning and of the wash of the case, but better add a protector of mattress that can withdraw and to wash easily.
Although at present cases of mattresses with closing of zipper in all its are manufactured perimeter, for which upon opening them they remain in two parts (¡something very important for the wash and the size of the washing machine!), its handling in the models of greater size (and by a single person) upon raising the mattress can seem a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In the bed, instead of a bedframe, ¿has a board sign?
Never!
As a lot for the beds thought so that even a night the visits.
Nevertheless, it should do (if them do not you have already) orifices of ventilation in the board and should be utilized with a mattress with springs in the interior and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in markets (as the German one Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
The mattresses of polyurethane should not be utilized on such bases.
For the bedframes of sheets not articulables and that contain between 14 and 18 sheets, mattresses of latex can be utilized or mattresses sándwich (for example, a combination of latex and coconut fiber), although is always better a bedframe with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar region are reinforced and its inflexibility can be regulated.
The bedframes of sheets articulables should not be utilized with a mattress of springs, since does not react to the reclinación.
Besides the adjustment of the inflexibility of the sheets, the protection of shoulders can be utilized also.
It is a matter of a special obsession of the sheets that permits to pressure or, even, to incline the sheets of such way that "surround" perfectly to the shoulders during the dream.
For the men that have some very wide shoulders, is a matter of something very important.
Even they agree of them the mattress-makers that, in the "male," they began to utilize a softer zone exactly around the shoulders.
Also they agree of the women, for which they put a softer zone around the hips.
For the most exacting clients, bedframes with structure in cross exist or of boards with the call amortiguación multitorsión.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should keep in mind also that, although utilize the mattress and adequate bedframe, if employs a bad pillow (large and "soft"), they will disappear the majority of the advantages.
The basic norm is simple: the pillow should maintain the head and the alone corners can arrive to the shoulders, so that they can relax the muscles of the same.
The adequate size recommended is of 50 x 60 cm, somewhat normal for example in Scandinavia.
Upon being fallen sideways, the pillow should be to the same level (when combines with the bedframe with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest zone of the mattress) that the height of the shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something that to see, as seems, with the mattresses original backfill of straw.
The manufacturers continue utilizing, each time most often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, are fashionable the biological mattresses.
The commodities based on petroleum, with the ones that the foam of polyurethane is manufactured, they are filled with natural oils, for example of castor or soy.
In fact, practically all the known manufacturers employ soy.
"Biological, in the case of the mattresses, he means that the center is manufactured only of materials of natural origin," explains Petr of the business Tropico Bonus.
Likewise, natural substances during the production of the case of the mattresses are utilized, one of the first aloe edge.
But can also opt for the microcapsules, that free a fresh fragrance to forest or lavender.
They exist likewise you differentiate for men and women.
While the men themselves "refresh" with vegetable statements of breeze, so that the case of the mattress absorb the heat and refresh the body, the women prefer "to heat" the case.
The statement of red pepper improves the circulation, so that the women feel more calidez.
The favorite at present?
The cold mattresses manufactured of foam, that are more porous, with a structure of cells adapted, which does that they be more permeable than those of polyurethane normal and they offer more permeability.
The combination of diverse inflexibilities of cold foam and viscoelástica permit to manufacture mattresses of diverse zones that know perfectly where goes the head, the shoulders and the heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost him of seven thousand crowns for up.
The ones that perform a therapeutic function are used to having a lower VAT, since they are considered like sanitary media.
The first one that obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It turns out to be complicated to save in the mattresses and bedframes.
At times the offerings of the manufacturers can be approved or salespersons, that from time to time offer two mattresses by the price of one.
For example, the mark Magniflex offers mattresses Duofreeze with a foam with memory Memory adhered to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free.
It was it of the viscoelástica with an open cell structure and a great density was initiated with the material "cosmic" of Tempur.
Initially it arose like material for the NASA, because during the takeoffs you praise astronauts were seen submitted to an enormous overload.
Tempur is softened with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Consequently, the hot, human body, exercises a perfect effect and adapts ideally its pressure.
Consequently, it is ideal to avoid that sores be produced, although also for improve the comfort during the dream.
The foam viscoelástica not alone is utilized in the mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and they alleviate them, as well as their circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, they utilize the foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
Each time more parents employ people monitoring devices to control their children
The fear by the children carries each time to more people to think about controlling them for GPS.
The system, initially thought for the monitoring of vehicles, can also continue the movement of the people and to contribute thus, for example, in case as the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Janatková.
For the moment the device has the approximate size of a box of matches, but soon will be reduced to the size of a clock.
To many people gave fear the case of the disappeared person and began to report on the available media to protect better to its children.
Even at the cost of invading its privacy.
"All we try to tell us that does not be a matter of spying, but of another middle to diminish the possibilities that a tragedy be produced," considers Petr Pilin of the business Macro Weil, one of the monitoring devices suppliers in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in you determined cases, he can abuse themselves such devices, for example if they are put in the bag of someone without their knowledge, but not yet we have come upon such cases."
"The majority of the clients really they buy it for reasons of security," adds Pilin.
In its opinion, the children should always know why serves the "little box" and how is utilized in case of emergency.
The psychologist childlike Dana notifies on the fact that, if the boy does not want to carry it, simply he will throw him.
"Even the smallest children show great creativity at the moment of to lose deliberately you determined things if want to avoid that they control them."
"Before, the parents trusted enormously in the mobile, but these they could be put out so easily as the device of monitoring," affirms.
In its opinion, turns out to be debatable if in case of attack such device is really useful.
"If it is a matter of an abduction prepared, the author practically will always verify if the boy carries some type of electronic device that his location can be watchful."
"Now is the telephone."
"According to go extending the use of the devices of monitoring, will also seek them, since its sale without doubt will be carried out with a lot of publicity.."
"In such cases, the delinquents always go a step by in front of the police," the psychologist says.
Nevertheless, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an unscripted attack of a pedophile.
According to Robert of the business RC Monitoring, that offers services of so much monitoring for vehicles as for people, even in the event that, after an attack, the device of monitoring be destroyed immediately, its presence can serve of aid.
"The device can configure itself so that send regularly the position after a determined period."
"If it suffers damages, at least will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
"The most expensive devices carry integrated a meter of inclination, for which if the person simply slips and he remains motionless, the device will emit immediately a warning with the position in question," affirms.
In its opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with the intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, in which only should be installed a special software.
The problem of the units of current monitoring is that for the moment is a matter of devices with a similar size to a box of matches or the mobile telephones of smaller size.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, by that reason tests are being carried out at present with devices that seem a digital clock.
"Besides, they will have the advantage added that a possible aggressor perhaps identify not the device."
"Or that identify it after certain time, which can do that the police win time," adds.
Although the devices of monitoring be carried in the wrist or hanging, they will continue utilizing the same technology that is employed for the monitoring of vehicles.
It is a matter of the verification of the position with a system GPS (that is utilized in the habitual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile telephone that communicates the current position.
The army has sufficient wicks as to surround every Chequia. But only two years last
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to turn on explosives.
Already last year the Department of Defense added to its arsenal 224 kilometers of wick.
Therefore, they have stock for 225 years.
The problem is that the useful life of the wick is of two years, four at the maximum.
The army bought the wick for explosives to the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The personnel of the General responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of a so enormous quantity of wick saying that the soldiers need for the maneuvers of formation 60 kilometers of wick to the year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnic of the army, with the ones that was put in contact MF DNES, is decided nevertheless that, in such case, they should carry out happinesses maneuvers with frequent use of explosives each year also all the generals, officials of highly command, and even secretaries and cleaning.
They did not want exempt neither the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Picek.
Only thus it would be able to justify that the army spend sixty kilometers of wick.
Such length equals to 25,000 explosions.
Although thus was, the army would have sufficient stock for more than ten years.
If to the contrary, just as the experts say, for the initial formation of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stock for the 225 indicated previously.
The soldiers of the fast intervention brigade complained personally does little before the Minister Vondra because they say that barely they have munition for diverse weapons, for which the practices of shot by question of money are limited even.
And we do not speak on the lack of underwear.
"I neither achievement to understand that such quantities of wick buy us repeatedly."
"But it is its decision and, without doubt, they will know why do they act thus."
"For us, the army is a good client to which, like business, we try to satisfy," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan.
The spokesman of the Department of Defense Jan Pejšek defends the saying wick kilometers hundreds also that will have stock of this "munition" as a minimum for ten years.
Nevertheless, Jan of STV Group, indicates that the so alone wick has an useful life of four years and, in the case of the pyrotechnic products for the army or the police, of two years.
"If it is stored in some perfect conditions, can last until four," one of the soldiers says that, by the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the finalización of its useful life, each munition should be verified carefully to see if continues being reliable and will not damage the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and they require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Department is that, upon buying 445 kilometers of wick, obtained a discount.
"They cost us a 60% less than the order of last year of 244 kilometers," indicates the spokesman Pejšek of the center of purchases of the Department of Defense.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of wick of the pyrotechnic of the police, that eliminate the munition of World War Two or it left by the Soviet army, does not surpass already since years ago the 1,500 meters.
Besides, the police always asks only the just quantity as to exhaust the munition before be finished its useful life.
They decided it for reasons of security for the pyrotechnic and, besides, in the meantime reliable and more modern types of wick can be obtained.
The Department already has clear difficulties to finish scores of thousands of tons of munition of the epoch of the Warsaw Pact, when the czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was prepared for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnic with the ones that he spoke MF DNES, after a pair of years the following problem with the current one will be produced: there will be that to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old wick, that is being bought now "cheap."
Up to now I continue living on the contacts that obtained thanks to the contest
The fact to win the contest "Businessman of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The the last edition, won the contest "Businessman of the year" the enterprising one of 28 years Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
Its history of success seems removed of a movie.
To Lukáš Pytloun charmed him to travel.
Abroad it realized that in Liberec caused lacks lodging of quality to good price.
With the savings that met with seasonal works abroad and a credit of the bank bought a house that was five-floor composed middle destroyed.
Keeping in mind that still he studied his third year in the university, he was really brave.
"Currently, the value of the lodging in our zone prompted me to do something on the matter," says Lukáš Pytloun.
It began to rent the first flat reconstructed to foreign workers.
All the incomes that obtained invested them again in the building, that gradually became a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, obtained little by little to open in Liberec four pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all the categories of lodging.
The most comfortable one of all was, until does little, the hotel of design of four stars Pytloun.
Nevertheless, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our concept of franchise, and other people are showing interest by a franchise of Pytloun," the businessman number said one of last year.
"To this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels helped in great measure the fact to win the contest of the 'Businessman of the year'," adds thanked Pytloun.
The victory enlarged its fame and so much popularity in Liberec as in the outskirts.
"The people recognized me along the street, still they congratulated me often and, I should I say, that was very pleasant," recalls.
Without doubt, recommends everyone that want to try some business that participate in the contest.
But it considers that is not necessary to win, but the participation already is beneficial.
It affirms that, up to now, continues living on the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, perhaps not to have obtained.
"With some people that I knew thanks to the contest I have begun to collaborate habitually."
The associated fame to the success, in its opinion, included likewise in the employees,
On the whole around seventy.
"I have seen that they show a greater loyalty and they are proud to participate in something that obtained the general recognition."
"Is not, neither much less, my own personal success, but is the result of the hard work of all the team."
"Only that is my name the one that appears in the first page," says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
To my successor him desire a more tranquil year of the one that have had in Farmet
The elation by the quick victory was dissipated for the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, is possible that Farmet already have passed the worse thing.
The owner of the business Farmet, Karel received the first prize in the last edition of the contest of Vodafone "Business of the year," last year in the "Slav House" of Prague.
The jury valued its efforts, with the ones that managed to convert a small technical workshop in Skalice in a firm with a hundreds business volume of millions.
"I can say that the not alone prize encouraged me me, but to all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competence," the winner of last year says.
The history of the business Farmet begins with the somewhat useful desire to do.
Therefore, when the State proposed the father of Karel the rent of a small workshop as clearing by the embargo of properties during the communism, did not doubt too much; renounced their position in the business in which worked and, with a pair of companions, they founded the business with their plastic batteries father.
Shortly after, they began to be specialized in presses of vegetable oil.
Eight years later became the greater manufacturer of automatic presses of the center of Europe.
They obtained a greater presence also among the public done not specialize after reaching the success in the contest in the mass media.
"Not alone our clients began to consider to the mark Farmet as considerably better, but also the foreign associates began to value the contribution with a business that obtained a greater success in his country," he says Karel.
Last year perhaps was not in Farmet alone a sample of the elation of the victory.
It obtained likewise recognition by the commercial results to the year 2008 and, partly, of the 2009.
And exactly the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The deterioration of the crisis, that yet had not reached so many citizens, caused that the businesses stopped its projects of investment and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, evidently, do neither we free us of such situation."
"The incomes were reduced in a 40%, we had to limit the production and even we had some dismissals," explains Karel.
A viable business owes, from time to time, to adopt even popular little measures.
Nevertheless, they controlled the situation and they maintained the profits of the business, although went to lower levels that before the crisis.
In spite of all, where Farmet did not trim expenses was in the investigation and development.
"With the subsidies we have built a center of investigation and formation, we reinforce the presence in the international market and we obtained magnificent appraisals in national fairs," he says.
All indicates that already they have left the crisis behind.
The incomes enlarge again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement they expect that contribute a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," indicates Karel.
A survey that is watchful the ridiculous norms
The survey of Absurdity of the year forms part for the fourth time of the business tournament.
Already it has managed to eliminate some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey Absurdity of the year was the obligation to carry to the administration documents to the ones that the officials can agree in line.
The decision adopted it more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security asked a statement of the business register, although its officials can obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security no longer will ask a statement of the business register when carry out a control of the impositions of the policyholder," declared the spokesman of Janus.
The objective of the survey Absurdity of the year consists of consulting the norms and regulation that should respect the businesses and businessmen in Chequia and to try that those they be eliminated that are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time splits of the business tournament of the publication noviny and begins to create fondness likewise among the general public.
While the edition of last year included the participation of three thousand voters, this year practically reached the four thousand.
And does not it turn out to be surprising, since still we have several legal obligations to spare that should be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of necessary roles for the income tax return we be in the first world place," comments Karel of the Association of small and medium businesses and of businessmen of the Czech Republic.
Since years ago, the simplification of the business norms is an objective declared of all the governments.
Nevertheless, in comparison with the remainder of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, since the point of view of the conditions to have a business, Chequia is situated in the position 74ª, that is to say, eight worse positions than last year.
The contest Absurdity of the year was celebrated for the first time in 2006 and each year is repeated in the same way.
Any it can indicate some administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when closes the contest.
The proposals can be carried out in the web page www.firmaroku.cz. Later, the organizer of the contest chooses seven candidates for the "antipremio" and, during October, he permits that the public vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
For the survey of this year they were presented more than a hundred, particularly 105 norms and regulations that make no sense.
The examples sent them as much businessmen as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was situated, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of the highways and freeways pay the toll or that the businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two baths paint every other year the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published in the pages of the contest.
The announcement of the contest, that always is carried out to starts of November in the plaza of Wenceslao of Prague, form splits of an event in which are used to participating personalities of the social and political world.
This year, for example, they attended this act of the contest Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium businesses and of businessmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"The economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State puts continuously you join the businessmen, because of it my objective consists of in eliminating each year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that at present complicate unnecessarily the commerce," announced the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
The efforts by eliminating the absurd regulations do not remain in water of borages.
In the year 2007, what more bothered to the people was the obligation of the businessman to communicate with an advance from three days to the business office of the zone of permanent operation, the intention to respond with a position to a fair or exposition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished in second place in number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the communication to the office of work on the part of its foreign workers of the trips of work of to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the call green card.
And to the third one goes it conquered.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the physical therapists to have in its consultation a great mirror, a refrigerator and two scales of floor.
Therefore, this year the Department of Health emitted a communication saying that had eliminated the obligation of having a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes to the responsible businesses socially

For this new one subcategoría special of the edition of this year of the main contest of Vodafone Business of the year 2010 businesses were presented for which the commercial success is not the long-term only objective.
The history of each one of them turns out to be inspiring and would permit us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between an and another, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that offer.
In a case, treats for example of the disabled people, in other of the personal problems or of health of the employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of all the Republic was situated, for example, the business praguense of software Et Netera, that supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, that later participate in tournaments of diverse sports.
Another example of company responsible for the zone of Pardubice is the Isolit-Brave business, that already carries seven years being the main one aportador of funds to sponsor the disabled children.

In Olomouc won the business of accounting MiRyz Soft, that reduced the labor schedule, even under the average of 35 weekly hours, without reducing the salaries.

"The individual candidacies for this contest are not permitted, since is a matter of a subcategoría of the main contest of Business of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the advising Bison & Rose.
The police carried out arrests during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund, in Beer
The police against the corruption carried out diverse arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
The detectives shackled a local businessman of the sector of the media and to the real estate businessman Luboš G.
As it seems, this I try to manipulate a public auction under way for the restitution of the rights of such way that the land auctioned him to receive an interested precise.
It should pay for it to Luboš G. half million of crowns.
"For the moment so alone I can say that the police seeks a person by bribe during a public auction and public tender," he told Právo the jefa of the attorney general of Beer Antonie Zelená, adding that for the moment he cannot divulge more details on the investigation under way.
After twenty-four hours, the police freed the businessman of 46 years.
On the way in which could influence in the public auction, given the little so alone, official information can speculate.
The spokesman of the Fund Agricultural Lubomíra responded to the questions of Právo saying that the police carried out really the arrest in the headquarters of Beer and was during a public auction.
"It is a matter of a client, not of one of ours industrious," needed.
According to the public auction is called "Assembly for the lands transfer proposals presentation according to the law on the land" and is carried out when several parts interested in relation to the land offered appear.
"These people, during the assembly, they offer an upper value to that of its restitution, that should be transfered before the value of the land be announced."
"In function of the offerings, the order of the buyers is determined and, later, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person that offer the greater offering" explained the spokesman of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to present to the assembly and, given that at the same time is a person interested because acquired diverse rights of restitution, he proposed to him interested in the land that would not participate in the auction.
For such favor, was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the moment of the arrest, had so much on top money.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Fund of Beer already since time ago.
It figured in the cause of the old leader of the PF Václav Sankot, that was accused by attending to the replacement of lands for which already a decision of construction had been emitted.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained of the Fund some lands predicted for the construction of public infrastructures, particularly in the place where a great highway to the industrial park should be built of Borská pole.
Later, changed them of very beneficial form with the judge by a house in the own historic center of the city with a very upper value.
In this case, the City Hall had to intervene because, otherwise, the lands blocked would avoid the construction.
The families should pay some additional expenses of several hundreds of crowns monthly
The homes will have to pay not alone from January for all the types of energy, but also by water and electricity, complements by heating and, in some cases, greater rents.
Consequently, the families will have to remove of the accounts receivable, from January, various hundreds of crowns monthly more than now.
The price of the electricity increases by 4,6%, the gas around a 2%, in some cities they should pay to a 10% more by the supply of water and many enlarge also the price of the central heating.
The ascent of the electricity for the families that live in apartments should elevate to some 100 crowns more to the year that now.
Nevertheless, the main suppliers of electricity reduced the prices, due to that has enlarging the support to the renewable sources energy production, particularly the photovoltaic one.
Nevertheless, the gas is recommended moderate, especially just as more the heating is used and, therefore, greater is the consumption.
In this case, also they should include a crowns hundreds pair more to the year.
While the electricity and the gas are recommended for all the country, the change of price of the central heating varies from a place to another.
The ascent of prices plans it chiefly the major municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Králové will pay from January by the central heating some 50 crowns more monthly, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns to the year.
The residents in Prague should also bear an increase from the 9% of the price of the water and the heating, especially in the event that the city aumente the rent of the infrastructures.
If the rent does not vary, the praguenses will pay a 6.8% additional.
The prices in Prague, nevertheless, they will continue being among the lowest of all the country.
In the north of Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates will be recommended a 7,4%.
They can enlarge considerably the prices of the 450,000-floor rent rented in Prague, where the regulation will finalize in January.
For example, the business CPI Byty, that possesses in Ústí nad Labem around 2,500 flats, will enlarge the rent from January in to a 100%.
The business will carry to the courts to whom they be not according to the new rent.
The regular rents, that benefit the residents of around 300,000 flats, they would be able to enlarge next year to a 10%.
The Czech youths get drunk with Fernet and ron. The beer no longer is of way, because does effect slowly
Fernet, ron, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen its parents.
Those they are the beverages that cause that finish in medical cares hard-drinking youths with a lower age to fifteen years.
The children that finish fallen in the hospital continuously to surpass distils it no longer they are an exception.
This drifts of the experience of the doctors that are found with such cases in the admissions of pediatrics of the hospital.
"To drink beer or came no longer is fashionable, because they delay a lot in getting drunk."
"Now the fashion are the strong alcoholic beverages," indicates to Právo the leader of pediatrics of the Hospital in the center of Bohemia, Pelikán.
"When they manage to catch him a bottle to its father of the closet, can be whisky, but normally is a matter of Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that is lightened with juice and of that does not smell so much," explains.
The spokesman of the university Hospital confirms him also Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, is used to try Fernet or ron."
"Those are the modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among the students."
"In some cases, they use firewater that caught at home," adds Jurinová.
According to the chief one Pelikán, are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years the ones that are used to appearing in the hospitals.
Before where it works since this year, worked during a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances carried the youths since the nearby zones.
"A girl had to enter perhaps four times."
"It began at the age of twelve, when they brought it with 3.5 of alcohol in blood, besides a mixture with ecstacy," indicates the doctor of the department on this case.
"He was found in the fair of Holešovice in some festival of dance."
"The interesting thing is that to his mother neither surprised him that his daughter to disappear 48 hours," the leader is surprised.
It is exactly the lack of interest of the parents or even its clear tolerance toward the beverage on the part of its children the one that the main cause of the increase of the consumption of alcohol among the youths is considered.
The experts indicate that, in the case of the children, himself he cannot be spoken exactly of dependence.
"He is understood for alcoholic to a person that has a chronic dependence of the alcohol for various years, with all the associated phenomena to the same one, which he is not produced in children."
"In those that drink alcohol repeatedly, more well is owed of a social milieu or systematically failed relative," explains the chief one Pelikán.
According to the spokesman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol they hospitalized themselves until the middle of November forty drunken children.
Nevertheless, the statistics only show the ones that respond with a serious intoxication and they should remain in the hospital.
The hard-drinking youths that, after the walking medical exam, they go home with the parents or with the police, they do not count.
Besides the cases in which the children simply gather after the school and they are drunk firewater, for Pelikán three seasonal ups and downs exist that fits to mention: the day of witches, End of Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstance, they drink for the evils you note or, to the contrary, they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"In the day of the witches I have come I see in admissions to seven drunken children at the same time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers that spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, they have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible one distils at home.
The morning headache, caused by the dehydration and the lack of glucose, is avoided with the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that lack to the agency.
"These carry it a lot better, because after the agitated night, they raise itself well and them nothing hurts."
"Only they are shown confused with respect to where they are," indicates Pelikán, adding that, often, the patients lose the good humor at least when they see the expenses that have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for serious patients comes cost about ten thousands of crowns.
"Often I have utilized the price as a middle to educate them, when in the visit I say them directly the children how much there is side its drunkenness and that would have that to spend all the summer in a work for youths so that won the sufficient thing to be paid that night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in their opinion perhaps as regressive measure, that is used to returning him the people the expenses of the processing, it does not do in the case of children that drink.
Two airplanes L-159 are found for the first time in alien hands in Spain
Two airplanes L-159 of a total of five, by the ones that the Department of Czech Defense substituted the airplane Marries C-295M, they left Tuesday for Seville, where the manufacturer of the airships is found Marries - EADS.
It is the first time that a device of this type is found in the hands of someone that be not the Czech army.
For the moment, only they were abroad to carry out flights of practices or of demonstration.
It is a matter of the two-seater version L-159T1, that up to now used the Czech army and that still was in state to fly.
The three remaining airplanes are the single-seater L-159.
These still they are conserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the business Omnipol, already took charge of them last week.
Jan Fishšk, of the defense press department, indicates that yet is not known when will they withdraw the airplanes physically of Vodochody.
"The airplanes single-seater L-159, on the other hand, they were separated of the airplanes repaired time ago, without investments neither additional contributions on the part of the Department."
"The two-seater L-159T1 they exchanged in its current state," told Právo Pejšek.
It added that the army does not remain without two-seater airplanes, since in May from 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract by an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four devices L-159 unnecessary for two-seater.
One of the new airplanes already the army in July received it, the other will be delivered to ends of year.
According to Pejšek, EADS compromised to that the airplanes be added to the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract is indicated clearly that the business EADS is the one that withdraws the airplanes L-159 and that will serve for the countries pilots practices of the NATO."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how is going to utilize them in this framework," indicates Pejšek.
The periodic noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by an airplane Marries and the purchase of other three airships for 3,500 million crowns they were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Department of Defense did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defense affirms that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreigner.
The Czech army acquired to Aer 72 airships and so alone utilizes 24, for which wants to sell the remainder.
The purchase of airplanes Marries possibly come to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission already denounced to the Department of Czech Defense before the Court of European Justice because should choose the airplanes carrying out a European tender and not being put in contact with an only manufacturer.
The army already received three airplanes House and the last one should arrive at the airport praguense of Kbely in fourteen days.
A more long finger index than the to annul indicates a lower risk to suffer cancer
The men that have the most long index than the to annul are subject to a smaller prostate cancer to suffer risk.
This is the surprising conclusion of a studied published Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
Would be able they depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can constitute a simple test of the prostate cancer to suffer risk, particularly for the men with ages of to 60 years," indicated the coautora of the study Ros Eeles, teacher of the Institute for the investigation on the cancer in the University of Warwick.
Consequently, the finger would be able to help to determine what men should be submitted to a prostate cancer test, particularly if this characteristic goes associate to a genetic risk or other damaging factors, like problems of family health, he as indicates Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, carried out the monitoring with a British counterpart of more than 1,500 patients with cancer of prostate and, simultaneously, of 3,000 healthy men.
More than the half of the participants in the study had the Indian finger of the shortest right hand than the to annul.
They presented the same prostate cancer to suffer odds that the 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of the men with a more long index than the finger to annul, this risk was reduced in a 33%; for the men with lower ages to 60% the reduction reached the 87%.
The relation between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the period prenatal, reflects different levels of hormones to the ones that is exposed the fetus in the headquarters.
A level of lower testosterone corresponds with a more long index.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterone influences in the development of the cancer of prostate.
The great geneticist Czech and old president of the Academy of Sciences, the professor Václav told that knows the study, but that him does not seem that the relation between the length of the fingers and the cancer be able "to show completely."
The Republic Czech low snow: they are closed the D1 and the D5
Chequia, just like the majority of Europe, woke up Thursday covered with snow.
The highways and sidewalks are covers chiefly by compact snow and the machines quitanieve circulated all the night by numerous zones.
In the morning was closed the highway D5 between the kilometers 89 and 93 in direction to Rozvadov due to various accidents of industrial vehicles and tourisms, just like the D1 in Brno in direction to Prague.
The news the user of the automotoklubu transmitted them (ÚAMK).
In the kilometer 91 a truck was damaged, in the 93 they collided two industrial vehicles that caused injured.
Also various tourisms finished in the gutter.
Problems in the road exist likewise D1 in the kilometer 185 in direction to Prague.
There they collided two trucks.
The conductors should they circulate slowly after Brno in the kilometer 190 or to cross Brno and to be incorporated in the kilometer 182 in Kývalce.
There jams of various kilometers have been formed.
Also an accident in the highway has been produced D11, just next to Prague.
Prague is cover by a blanket of snow of various centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 ºC.
Jams are being formed for example in Prosek, although also is congested.
The surest middle of transportation is the meter.
The trolleys circulate with delay, for example in the line between Karlovo and Míru.
At eight in the morning, will be produced another state of crisis in Prague.
The problems affect likewise to the railroads and to the airport.
On account of the snow, the business of Czech railroads should annul seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, to the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
The travelers should verify which is the current situation.
The airport closed since the eleven at night on Wednesday to the five in the morning.
At present, already can circulate by the majority of the southern highways of Moravia, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska are closed to the circulation three secondary highways, in tongues of snow are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to agree to you determined access roads to the highest points.
One of the most they affected places was Vyškovsko.
Up to now they are closed the connections: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Clear them milling machines will be required.
For the moment themselves cannot be told when will they be opened to the circulation.
In Hodonínska, caution in the zone of the Bílé is required Karpaty (Carpathian white).
The highways of the region that, given that is a matter of a natural zone protected, simply they should be left in inert state, they accumulate to five centimeters of snow, as indicates.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the blanket of snow reaches the 18 centimeters.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, they fell around 15 centimeters of snow.
The snow-covered they remit gradually in Chequia.
The American soldiers have a new one "arms intelligent"
The American army is employing in Afghanistan a new weapon "intelligent," known for the moment only by the name codified XM-25.
The generals expect that the new rifle influence in the local conflict with the Talibans and that "change the progress of the play" did its victory.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an aim extremely I need.
Its bullets shoot themselves with a laser with a precision of various meters.
The special munition of caliber of 25 mm created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes that in reality function like a small one Granada.
The projectiles can be planned so that they exploit not only when they strike to the objective, but in any point that be found in his path ballistics.
They can be utilized against the enemies that hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without doubt, itself not a normal protection can be utilized and, when throws its murderous rain of metallic chips, can turn out to be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, that spoke on the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry that utilizes a technology "intelligent."
"The soldiers manipulate it of such way that find the objective, they aim at the same one its laser beam, that determines the distance, later obtains an aim I need and, in function of the same one, corrects the line of projection and presses the trigger."
"We say that 543 meters have been measured."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is charged and throws the projectile to a distance of 543 meters, more less one, two or three meters," indicates Audette.
400 Jobs are transferred
The consortium Fujitsu transfer its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will change their place of work of their previous building of offices in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu transfer its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As it communicated the giant of the sector specialized in computers and their maintenance Wednesday, 400 men and women they will be transferred in July of the following year of their previous building of offices in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Star Park, a great complex of offices on the street Lyoner Straße in the neighborhood of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokesman of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term other 100 employees more than the consortium, that previously they were found disseminated by the region, they will be lodged there.
The offering is highly attractive, besides the collective office in Star Park will favor the way to work of the employees.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only boarder in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner affirmed, "in Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central court summons with an excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important currently for a global business as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important business in the region caused yesterday happiness among the ones that were in favor and deception among the ones that were against.
The economy section leader of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) affirmed that with that has earned itself a "Global Player."
This is a "magnificent recognition to the court summons."
Fujitsu writes down in the city, the settlement is a great impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The green) regrets of the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction reported before to the city on its intention.
"Naturally we have offered to the business our aid," declared Korwisi.
Nevertheless, the good contacts of the computer-maker with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
When all is said and done, the economic motives produced the fall.
In such a way, now there is a great empty place that to cover in the famous position.
"I expect that the owner and the lessor of the building be shown cooperative."
The real estate previously utilized by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" they formed part with the surplus buildings of Marienbader Platz since ten years ago of a controversial project of construction of the city spa.
As joint project of the city and of a private enterprise of projects between the station and the City Hall is formed a new entrance to the city, that takes charge of the criticism as for the massive building that previously utilized the holes as plazas of parking and as for the level of the buildings.
In 2001 they have been installed the department of investment and businesses of valuation, the Software-maker for systems of reserves, Start Amadeus, as well as then united Siemens with the house computer-maker Fujitsu.
In 2006, the employed building by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-they Grind-Gruppe along with Morgan Stanley Real you Be you and a year later resold to the Spanish one Falcon Real Be you Investments LTD in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, native of Tokyo, is recognized like the third greater world supplier of YOU.
It has businesses, for example of computers and servants, and I lend also the precise services.
The branch office in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the greater in Germany, of all ways Fujitsu counts on more business in Munich.
The subsidiary one Fujitsu Technology Solutions from Bad is installed Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a business with the name of TDS.
Therefore 7,000 square meters in the Star offices building have been rented Park.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its plan with form of star, harbors among others to the central association of electrotécnica and to the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the servant - Threats against Assange
The anguish is empowered each time more than Wikileaks.
The Internet Service Provider Amazon has eliminated the platform of revelations of its servant.
Possibly behind political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents be found.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, apparently is person under arrest in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the white one of the criticisms, always more strong in the United States.
The activists of internet lost the access to their previous American servant and at present they seek a country of internet in Europe.
The acquaintance American senator, Joe Lieberman, flame to other countries and businesses to the boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, that is found in the list of people sought of Interpol, person under arrest in Great Britain should remain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled of the servant of Amazon."
"To speak freely in the country of the liberty," they communicated the activists of the revelations by means of the service of messaging Twitter Wednesday (local time).
A short time before, the internet business, Amazon, had eliminated the documents of Wikileaks of its servant.
The activists of internet had resorted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the web of services Amazon to be able to face the high figures of access to the documents.
By means of Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following thing: "Perfect, we will destine our dollars to hire to people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with the freedom of speech, "to should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servant by means of Wikileaks, after an employee of the senator Joe Lieberman to have requested investigations, reported the chain CNN according to a call to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the counsel of the senate for the security of the country had threatened Amazon with boycott, reported the British one "Guardian."
"He had desired that Amazon took these measures before, before the previous publications of information classified by means of Wikileaks," declared the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also to prohibit in other countries the use of the servant.
"The inconsiderate, monstrous, and illegal process of Wikileaks puts in play our national security and threat the life in the world," was affirmed in a communiqué of the independent senator.
"Any responsible business, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with its service to extend material stolen.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, that is sought in Sweden by suspects of violation, is found in the list of people sought of Interpol.
According to an article of the periodic Londoner "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years is found person under arrest in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The activist of internet has qualified constantly the investigation in Sweden as a plot of its enemy.
The spokesman of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, affirmed in London that threats they have existed.
"There was even calls on a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore it is feared for the security of Assange, affirmed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, it continues without being revealed the locating of the founder of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson reacted evidently before the statements of North America.
In America, the previous republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, affirmed that the responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks should be judged by treason and should be executed.
In Canada, affirmed a counselor of the leader of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange would owe "to be murdered" and Obama would be able "to use a drone."
Among the White House and Assange grows a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesman of the American president Barack Obama, qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange have asked the resignation of the secretary of state, in the event that she be responsible for ordering recently to diplomats that were involved in tasks of espionage.
"I am not of the every insurance why the opinion of a type with a web page should import us," declared Gibbs.

"We have done everything possible to put us in contact with them," affirmed the spokesman of the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help to protect them if was necessary."
The university of the ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna ice cream vendors in the better times of year are prepared.
The basic course of three days for future ice cream vendors has the maximum affluence and visitors of the entire world.
In reality from where all the comes ice cream?
Of the gelatiere and of the gelataio.
The gelatiere devises the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of the elaboration of ice creams.
The gelataio removes with a spatula the cream of the ice cream of the counter, extends it on the cone and sells it.
To know this, does not do lack to go to Anzola dell' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who he want to know more on ice creams, he should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian business Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped to the university of the ice cream with the freezer in the year 2003, so that the cream of the ice cream of its machines comply the high ideal Italian everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future ice cream vendors has the maximum affluence and visitors of the entire world.
Also there are more special courses of more days on the ice cream of chocolate and practices in the ice cream parlor of the own house.
In these times of crisis, some they dream of a new professional career, other they risk in the smooth ice cream their vague desires.
This time are 40 participants of 19 countries of all the continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing by Hungary.
To Jacky, teacher of this art of California, the slow movement of the food and in the future charms him wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of the industrial ice cream.
Anke, of Berlin, is assesses of businesses and wants to create somewhat own in some years inside an enervating work.
Two Egyptian youths dream of opening an ice cream parlor in the Cairo.
A man of Malta and another of Brazil they want to improve the quality of the ice creams of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because to its children charm them the Italian ice creams.
The ice-cream teacher Luciano Ferrari explains the participants subsequently the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Is not decisive alone its good flavor, but also its silky smoothness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget its formation neither the covered with cream of the national upper house and chiefly southern of the country: "The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and therefore each ball has somewhat romantic."
The first step to the elaboration seems facilísimo.
Luciano throws the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers in a great mixer, that heats all with an electronic program to 85 degrees and to the moment chills it to four degrees.
Then it opens the faucet of the machine and a white basic cream leaves pasteurized, the base for all the milk ice creams types.
Suddenly, the professor asks: The cream of ice cream can be devised alone with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How free rein to some desires to experience can be given?
Luciano advises that they be confused of the tendencies of the epoch.
The one that speaks of ice cream "not alone of natural ingredients," maybe has utilized stabilizers, chiefly a natural product, probably rubber guar, of bean guar.
Of course that can devise ice cream without stabilizer, only one must buy it a day, to place it in a market and the client will bite a sonorous ice cream of granite.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
Fragrances are employed.
As for the flavor of the ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes among the ingredients the ones that are bought in the section of fruit or in that of candies of the supermarket.
Ademas, there are dust and pastes.
"All the suppliers will try to strain ingredients aromatizados in their merchandise."
"Nevertheless they should experience some time."
Whether with sherbets of fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the white basic mass, that with eggs will return a yellow cream and with cocoa in dust as base for all the possible pleasures of the chocolate.
Now the participants of the course can use the freezers.
Luciano leaves them to devise each time four different types from vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and countersinks, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less fragrance of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
They carry out the same experiment also with fruit ice cream types.
That know better does not depend necessarily that have more fragrance of tofe or more purée of fruits.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of you countersink know to dry fruits, if contains more countersink.
The working party devises the worshipped ice cream of kiwi, that utilizes more fruits, less water and something less than stabilizer.
First a stable mixture stands out the flavor of the ice cream, affirms Luciano.
The elaboration of ice creams is a problem of artimética: The purée of peach with a lot of sugar is employed, one must lower the proportion of sugar of the basic prescription.
For the ice cream of lemon causes lacks a sugar extra portion.
Luciano removes an utensil with the one that fixed the quantity of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winegrower for Oechsle in the grape juice of grape).
Fortunately the boards facilitate the account.
Devising ice cream does not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not alone aid the utensil for the automatic elaboration of the basic mass.
Also there is an utensil, in which itself bat simultaneously the mixture of ice cream prepared and is chilled to temperature below zero.
In spite of all, all the automation remains was as for the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains to itself and to its upper companions to down with purée of fruits, as if was a miniprimer gigantic without control.
"In all the courses," affirms the master one Luciano, "is alone a question of time that even something thus."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European authority of security of the food Efsa has infiltrated in the industry that experiences with genetically modified plants.
At present this matter formulates it the group of expert Testbiotech, that an institute for the independent evaluation of the impact of the biotechnology is considered.
"A theory of conspiracy seems but it we have not documented well," affirmed Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts of Efsa on plants genetically modified, and another expert of Efsa also they are hired since years ago in the association Ilsi.
The consortiums as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer sponsor it.
Kuiper has collaborated in a significant way in the controls of Efsa of plants genetically modified, what situates him in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The dispositions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and they imitate the writing of the business, that in reality is controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collision of interests.
Thus, it does little, a manager of highly rank of Efsa was without the support neither the time of transition to the Swiss one Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that its edict.
It does little, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, that carried out the Oficinal General of the Environment as well as a clairvoyant parliamentary one of the EU.
Nevertheless, Efsa can recognize no conflict of interest.
It resorts to all the formal data, also to some of the industry, provided that they being of a high and technical quality, they are ordered in a report.
Themselves it is required the experts that work in Efsa that have not no contact with the industry.
But they should expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits its work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in United States.
It is called to itself as a neutral forum for the experts and the science, the industry and the politics, among others for the evaluation of the risk for the biotechnology without the assignment of Lobby.
In this theme, independent experts, like Then, they criticize that at present genetically modified plants be permitted without investigating the food for the animals and that itself not the influence of the plants be verified genetically modified in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, does the corn genetically modified in the agriculture," affirms Then.
The current practice consists of verifying unicamente proteinas remote, but not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If themselves not the risks are sought, ¿how do they be going to find?," question, accusing, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks in the same way.
The scientist investigates since 1994 the field of the genetic engineering and at present he works in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this environment, the industry tries each time more, in United States and in Europe, to influence or to discredit the critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists that be not influenced by consortiums.
For the businesses, the critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls the investigation of the security," maintains Hilbeck.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has obtained some, on the whole some 400 kilograms.
Monday was before the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba to the backs.
There were demonstrations
Snowed.
The history is known: In September the excavators arrived and they began to knock down a great piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart never was again the same one: Thousands and thousands they were declared against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing itself hizó debris.
Broken in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A pair of pieces has been assured.
"These stones are relics."
"They should not disappear."
It is enthused: "A natural simple, poor and, and cheap stone."
As he said once, he has smelled the smoke of the cigarettes.
Does not yet what know will do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The trace of the stones of Stuttgart carries to a forest in Tubingen in a previous ammunition dump of the French Armada, where Manuel Rongen erected its stone Stein-Reich.
The man of 44 years treats with old stones.
It has bought everything that result of the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonors, they would grind the gravel or they would send it to the scavenger," affirms in its office, a little house of wood that once was a cottage of guard.
They insulted and they threatened, explains, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, that had bought the remainders of the north wing to the business of demolitions.
The he spoke with the enemies of the 21S during several days.
And it explained them that could do absolutely nothing by the demolition.
And when it happened, then went it more reasonable, when the stones continued being used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the mazizo of 80 cut kilograms, with a price by piece from 6.50 to 14 euro.
Some they took it as memory but also with the hope to be able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
Approximately the half is still in the forest, the remainder time ago that was sold.
Owner of gardens, gardener landscape painter, responsible for projects.
All parts arrived from and they were carried what could be carried in the trunk and on top.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse time ago that has become "the wall" or in the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality this stone is nothing special," affirms Rongen.
"If was not by the political component."
It elevates to its off-road vehicle, does a tour by its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied right, he interrupted its studies, and later biology, the computers interest him and finally works with stones.
And is a lover of the stones.
It lodges to 4,000 tons of stone.
It transports its treasures for every Germany.
He says to be the major dealer of old stones of the country.
It brakes.
In the snow there is artistic stones of sandstone stung.
"Pertencieron to the bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Limestone dawn, yellow, hot, is enthused.
"My darling stone."
The road crosses the forest.
It indicates a pile: Red sandstone, a previous piece of the station of Karlsruhe.
And continues.
"Pretty travertino."
Old the mazizos belonged to the tribunal of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
All over in the snow, stones and histories, travertino yellow of the police headquarters of Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, tufa of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about as carved before the stones and moved them with a simple gear and a wagon, feels very devout.
"It would be a scandal if something be to destroyed."
Itself it has not done rich, at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people gave that to do the dealer of stones, besides stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have been installed up in the forest.
"We work hard, but is satisfactory," affirms the man that takes charge of taking advantage of the remainders.
Before long has to go to Cologne.
There also there are stones that to rescue.
Fights of talents around large potentials
Reign an active affluence in the buffet.
16 students crowd around the rolls, the soup of tomato and the candies.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car-maker Vokswagen have invited to a workshop to the students of mechanical engineering and design.
In an ideas contest species, they have to speak on the car of the future with the workers of VW and besides to learn all on Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many businesses, like VW, they gather in a fight body to body around the most privileged minds in contributions with the universities.
Its mission: Hiring as soon as possible the students with more talent of the universities, before they enter the labor market and they are hired for other.
And as the universities do not facilitate publications on the abilities of their students, he tries to scrutinize to the exceptional talents in practical projects and to grasp them.
The second day of project in the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins to the talents.
A young lady of the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bands and folders with the logo of VW.
It explains to them excited youths talents the programs of practices and the works for students and shows them its roads in the consortium.
Do not Seal of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parts: "The students enter contact with the industry and they acquire experience."
"At the same time, VW can know the students, to observe more than fence to the interesting candidates and to consider them as possible future industrious."
Some contributions, he says he Seal, they are not little common.
The news is in which the students are desired so directly.
"The main point previously was found in the technical projects," affirms Seal.
The fight by the fresh graduates is returning harder.
In many branches, the businesses no longer can choose their employees among a great group of applicants.
If that they have not to be announced and, above all, to obtain a labor highly qualified.
All the students of the disciplines of engineering are found in an excellent situation of negotiation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by their acronyms in German), in October 40,000 positions of vacant engineers existed.
And, according to the prognósticos of the VDI, this empty one of engineers will grow still more.
In the business of audience and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta takes charge of the hunt of talents.
It organizes costly events of contracting, like the career KPMG, a type of yincana modern, in which the participants have to find their road by means of them coordinated of the GPS.
The business wants to send eight very promising students to United States the following year.
Besides the participants can observe the subsidiaries of KPMG and to learn about the business.
Who is decided should go in two rounds of election in the exit.
Alone the crème of the crème of many participants goes to United States.
The universities endeavor each time more in choosing and to polish to the high potential of the universities, according to Dykta.
"With the career we want to emphasize of the mass."
"The simple journey in and of itself remained itself us short."
For the cazatalentos Dykta the notes give results.
"Until today we have an action seemed in the last year with all the participants."
"Some they are found near its end, and they want to request to work with us," affirms.
Besides the direct approach in the campus, also they are to the hunt, above all, the classical, medium and small businesses with their fairs of the work.
"We try to obtain students in the fairs specialized."
"Something on Intersolar," affirms Sitha Stübe, responsible for personnel for the solar technology-maker Solarworld.
The business Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
At present in the web page of the business 35 vacant positions appear.
"It is being very complicated to fill the vacant positions."
"It costs a lot time and money," affirms.
A shorter road is the contact with the professors of the university.
Solarworld collaborates with several upper schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"The professors advise that can be done practices with us or to carry out their thesis.
Themselves not faces advertising campaigns for the solar specialists are carried out.
Therefore the business needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, hierarchy plain and comfortable communication.
"A great consortium normally cannot offer it," declares Stübe, the responsible for personnel.
In the search of an employment, the money no longer is it more important.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good possibilities of ascent.
According to a study of the Great Tackle to Work Instituts, Solarworld shows off the plaza 55 among the 100 better employers of Germany.
The institute devises an annual list of the better suppliers of German employment.
For what asks the employee the satisfied thing that is with the work and with the environment in the same one and observes the prior conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the responsible for personnel also expects points extra in its classification by its contenders to work.
"I believe that the applicant itself fixed especially in the external classifications of an employer potential," affirms.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises to the businesses that quieran a long-term strategy that be won a good fame as employers.
It advises its clients more authenticity.
And that signifies, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
"The best road to be done attraction as employer passes for the own employees," assures.
In the slang of the sector is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity inside the own staff.
"Some satisfied employees are the better ambassadors."
When it treats well to the people and they identify it with the business, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer on the part of friends and acquaintances.
"It is like a play with gang," affirms Kriegler.
Obama stops new petroleum drillings
Since the coast of the American state from Florida to the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these not a single year new petroleum drilling.
The government of Washington emitted a forceful prohibition and with it annulled its previous plans in an unappealable way.
Also before the Atlantic coast new drillings preserves remain for the moment.
This announced the home secretary, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What caused this strict prohibition, that at least will be in force the following five years, is the explosion of the garden apartment "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the misfortune that cost the life to eleven workers and caused environmental the greater catastrophe of the United States, the president Barack Obama had admitted new drillings in the western part of the gulf of Mexico low pressure of the opposition and of the industry.
The followers thus wanted to diminish the dependence of United States of new supplies of petroleum of the foreigner.
Until today itself it has not been clarified of the all whose is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the gulf.
In the center of the criticism the British energy consortium is found BP, that is confronted millions of demands.
A commission of investigation entrusted by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the home secretary, raised the moratorium of drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, different consortiums peteroleros presented requests for new intents of drilling.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe employing some harder controls and some stricter regulations of security.
At present the authority of responsible control, that after having been accused of charges of corruption has fallen in discredit, is reformed of root.
Obama announces in a parallel way that will close the lucrative tax loopholes for the consortiums of the petroleum and of the gas.
The industry announces publicly that the total extraction in the gulf will be smaller thanks to a stricter regulation, to date.
"The plans of the government are the major brake for the growth of the industries of the petroleum and of the gas," the result of the current poll carried out by the business he says he assesses BDO - before the prohibition of extraction on Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance complains of the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
The investments in new projects of extraction are prolonged for the quick thing, in detriment of the growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is márrón petroleum, smells as a gas station: Millions of liters poured of crude oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian one Ogonilandia.
The people lives on the robbery, the corruption and the illegal commerce of petroleum.
To Celestine Akpobari seems him well.
"Do not tire," calms down the environmental activist to the journalists: "Today it will pass sufficient petroleum before your eyes."
The Nigerian one of 37 years has managed to photograph boys fording in the water to the chest with the shine of the lights reflected in turmoils in the surface: With the color shine of the water, the scene seems almost pretty.
Themselves he is not seen that on the surface they float you stain brown of petroleum.
Before here it caught shrimps to handfuls, explains Esther Badom in the edge of the river Bodo-Jetty.
While, the water flowed are completely dead.
Five years ago poured itself in the formidable wetland an impressive quantity of petroleum by a broken tubing.
The fish of the outskirts of the small city of Bodo had to swim six hours to arrive at full water of fish: That, in the heart of the delta of the Niger and situated in Ogonilandia, is considered like one of the most plagued regions of the world.
On the road of the traveled through of the river that passes for mangrove swamps, the extensive desolation turns out to be obvious.
Instead of clear water, the motor of the ship removes a brown broth, who submerge its hand in the water, will remove some full of petroleum.
The raices of the trees of the mangrove swamps are elevated since the floor as dark sticks of licorice, sadly they isolate the palm tree that collide and they hang their palms.
In vain flocks of birds are sought, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as it silences the barrier of the outside, is expanded in her a species of ghostly calm of a previous paradise with smell to gas station.
"What here occurs is an ecological fight," affirms, shy, Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger for the health."
The military comparison proceeds.
The zone of the settlement of the ogoni is a quarrelled field of battle since years ago: Here they burst over 60 years ago the first European explorers, here the first resistance in the years was organized 80 with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place its first factory the consortium Shell in 1993, because would be too dangerous for the employees of the petroleum.
Still nowadays it is prohibited the return of the businesses to Ogonilandia: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of oil of all the region of the delta, of a size three greater times that Swiss, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometers of tubings, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were tranquil, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each two hundred meters excelled platforms of steel as eccentric sculptures of the water: "Arbolitos of Christmas" they called lovingly to the heads of the drills.
They have to 50 years, the majority they present a total corrosion.
To every single moment fails a headrest, thinks Akpobari, then a constant spurt of petroleum in the water runs.
According to the appraisals of the experts, they have poured themselves more than two billion liters in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the quantity of oil penetrates, as in it damages of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea of Alaska, one of the greater catastrophes ecologists of the history of the humanity.
Who be responsible for the lasting environmental region, will fight with it.
While the consortium of Shell and the robberies organized of petroleum are responsible for more 90 percent of the contamination, the ecologists see the headrests on the verge of being broken and to the tubings with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell applies chiefly low standards of security normally in the world the conventional, reproached the scientific one Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: Only the indices of defects of the tubings are "on a greater multiple that in another place."
In a place, that from afar seems forgot, a full workshop of petroleum under the sky appears free, figures from among the mangrove swamps arise: They are naked and covered with petroleum.
Among one of the many barrels, that at times they are you united to the drillings, at times widespread arbitrarily on the land, a fire blazes: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the petroleum is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
In the first place, the gasoline penetrates by means of the tubings in the container, later the tubing of petroleum drips and finalemente leaves diésel.
In this manner, Michael and four employees produce daily to four barrels of diésel of 300 liters: "It contributes us 34,000 naira," around 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the greater oil states of the Africa black.
Nigeria alone counts on an ONLY refineria.
With the absurd and cheap price of the diesel one of barely 40 euro-hundredth by liter the illegal heaters can offer still less: Thus they reduce the value of their commodity.
It stems from "the of the bunkers," that trucaron the network of tubings that crosses Ogonilandia: According to the experts, at this rate 16 million liters of petroleum to the day in all the are lost at least delta of the Niger.
Only an insignificant part of the material provisional cousin stored is refined clearly of illegal form: The criminal networks organized, to the ones that also politicians they belong and military high-ranking officials, they keep the best part in aljibes and they sell it inexpensively in the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers purely educator the debate on if the environmental catastrophe is owed more well to the management of the population or to the limp way of production.
"If the tankers did not behave as the invaders and they had not destroyed completely the natural habitat of the fish, do not there would be sabotage, neither robberies, neither refinerias illegal."
While the conditions of the ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that alone a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like the China."
Michael is put nervous.
"Already it goes being hour that disappear," the muscular one says Ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special unit of the army catches the illegal refiners, them does not threaten with arresting them, if not with a painful bribe.
The north coming soldiers also want, as all the Nigerian, to remove benefit of the commodity.
"This it condemned invention has done pieces completely to our country," affirms Akpobari.
The investigators detect defects of dangerous factory in the motors of the A380
Apparently, the A380 has a great problem of security.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a compulsory landing, the investigators found a possible defect of factory, that can produce "a disastrous failure in the motor."
The airline Qantas wants to demand the manufacturer of the motor.
The passengers of the Airbus of Qantas that carried out a landing of emergency at the beginning of November they had a lot of more luck than the one that can imagine: The authorities of Australian air security perceived thanks to their investigations a great problem of security in the motors of some A380, and they alert of a possible defect of factory.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a connection of muffs, cracks by fatigue can be caused or cracks, announced the authorities of the ATSB in a report published Thursday.
This would be able to have caused "a disastrous failure in the motor."
This affected to the motors manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 airplanes of the series A380.
Among the ones that the Qantas-Airbus is found that had to carry out a compulsory landing November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline initiates legal averages against the British turbine-maker.
It presented a demand in the federal court of Sidney that enabled more legal measures against the business.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, declared that its airline will demand a compensation by the incident of principles of November.
In the mark of the motor they have lost pieces and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of the gasoline as the cause of the damages.
After the incident, until 40 motors of the entire world have to be replacements.
The Australian investigators announced that they will perform more you test of security to the superjumbos gifted with the motors affected.
The recommendation of security is the result of a contribution with Rolls Royce, affirmed Martin they Cut, spokesman of ATSB.
The problem of security has become it sufficient important as to inform all them affected.
After the landing of emergency of the apparatus of Qantas, the airline maintained to its fleet A380 in land during many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately to three of its eleven A380 temporarily in land.
Lufthansa replaced the motor of an A380 as precautionary measure.
This airplane with double cover is the largest passenger plane of the world.
A Snowfall in all the country causes the chaos in the traffic
Germany completely white: Of a day for another has snowed in almost all the country.
In many streets queen the chaos, the trains they fail and the airplanes.

The traffic very is limited in the majority of freeways and in many streets.
In the A7 to the height of Flensburg, the snowplow they are in continuous operation, removing the new snow time and again, but is not prepared.
Besides, strong gusts of wind of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) wait alive tides with the water level 1.2 meters above its habitual level in the coast of the Baltic sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony the accumulation of snow caused considerable problems in the freeways and in the interstates.
According to the weather service Meteomedia, the red warning is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, in reality the highest warning.
There there is partly 30 centimeters of snow recently fall and strong and cold winds take charge of whirling it.
There they remained trapped during the night many trucks and cars.
Also in Saxony Anhalt the police authorities notified important disorders in the streets.
In the A2, the snow and the wind paralyzed the traffic and created jams.
In Turingia the snow-covered they affected to the A4 and to the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, large inconveniences in Saxony are expected, Saxony Anhalt, Turingia and in the north of Bavaria.
The snow in the highway, the trees fallen on the rails or the catenaria destroyed and the holes are the main problems.
In Saxony the intercity service is suspended of Leipzig to Nuremberg.
In Saafeld, Turingia a train HOIST had to stop its trip to Munich.
The firemen and the service of rescue they attended the 165 passengers in the train with blankets of wool, food and beverage.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
In the major German airport, the winds with snow caused numerous suspensions of flights.
According to a spokesman of the head office of flight information, in Munich already some cancellations have been announced.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman of Fraport already there is 40 flights canceled.
The snowplow they are in continuous operation.
Nevertheless, there are few stranded passengers in the airport, in spite of that there is 400 beds of campaign prepared for them.
In many streets, Wednesday afternoon already there were many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver passed away in a collision with a train in a crossing of way in Ostholstein.
The operator suffered light injuries.
In the proximity of Nuremberg a similar accident on account of the snow-covered streets was produced: Also here a truck was reached in a crossing of ways because the vehicle remained blocked.
The conductor lost the life.
In the train four passengers turned out to be injured, the traveled through of Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for that reason in the morning.
Besides a woman of 30 years passed away, after giving an upset with her car near Aschaffenburg in a slippery highway.
The meteorologists have some good news: The snow will be increasingly more smooth and type dust and therefore will whirl in smooth gusts of wind.
But the wind will diminish.
Alone the Baltic sea will be seen affected by fast and strong winds.
Without doubt will continue doing a lot of cold, in some places to 15 negative degrees.
Deusche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to be separated of its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its towers of offices in its headquarters of Frankfurt.
The property would be able to contribute until 500 million euro.
Recently Deutschen Bank fixed its headquarters: The twin towers in the neighborhood of the banks were modernized of Frankfurt; while the bankers returned to their place of old work.
But now the financial consortium wants in appearance to remove benefit the prices of the reonvación, and search a buyer for the two skyscraper, as affirms the "Financial Times Deutschland" basing on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not name the motives of the sale in project.
"Always we verify if agrees to possess the properties or to sell them and subsequently to rent them again," affirmed.
Therefore credit the greater institution of Germany renounces again to the headquarters of its business after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euro of the investor of a fund of the house and subsequently carried out him the pertinent arrangements.
The energy reforms reached some figures of approximately 200 million euro.
A sale would suppose a lot of money for the bank.
The experts of this environment calculate the value of the towers of the renowned newspaper as "Greentowers" in about 500 million euro.
If the buildings renewed in a fund of the bank are sold or to an independent investor has not been revealed at present, he affirmed the spokesman.
Thousands of people of mourning by the miners dead
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought about the miners buried, that were given for dead after many explosions in a mine.
Todavia not the corpses have been able to be found, because the measures of security continue being precarious in the place of the misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago took place an intense explosion in the mine Pike River near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners of ages between 17 and 62 years remained buried in the mine.
A probe in the place of the misfortune was introduced, but did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of poison gases and successive explosions, no team of rescue could descend for motives of security.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts deduced that there was not possibilities that the miners had survived.
Themselves they have not been able to recover the bodies to date.
At present the relatives and friends recall the dead with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the shining shine of the sun in Greymouth in the new zealander southern island.
They keep silence for two minutes.
In homage of the miners buried, 29 tables with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners were placed.
Also there were photographs and personal objects, underneath articles of clothing and surfboards.
The flags rippled to average shaft before the governmental buildings of the country.
New Zealand expected that the miners to return to the surface "of the depths of the land," he said John Key, the president of the of new zealand government, to the participants of the commemorative act.
"But never they returned home."
It cannot assume the death of his son until have not seen his body, affirmed Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Next to the president of the government and to the relatives of the victims participated in the commemorative act many foreign diplomats.
In the first explosion November 19 were also buried miners of south african and British origin.
The workers of rescue began extinguishing a fire in the interior of the mine of coal in the southern island of new Zealand.
As soon as they have extracted the explosive gases, the burning temperatures of the interior of the mine will begin to descend, declared Gary Knowles, the superior of the police, to the journalists.
To the devil, warlike!
The gore inserts in the artistic movies?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores again the borders of the kind with its epic of battles "Walhalla Rising."
In what public there will be thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn upon rolling "Walhalla Rising"?
A warlike imprisoned Viking with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees of his tormentors and murderer to his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young spectators that seek bloody action, exactly because to our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and to start his enemies the intestines of his bodies with life when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as is called in reality, not any word during all the says almost movie and the other personages are left to carry for as a lot of one or two phrases or a pair of arduous mortal shouts.
Otherwise they silence and enjoy the pretty and horrific mountainous landscapes of Scotland, that the frames offer to the world Viking of approximately thousand years ago.
More well ideal for filmmakers grown and interested in the existentialism and in movements of very calm camera.
When a movie has various groups of recipients is a grief that themselves they cannot be ruled out mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers their savages and to the trilogy on the combed drug dealer "Pusher" as a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but is denied stoic to do that its works be for all the public with slightly more than humor in the main current or something less than brutality of the artistic house.
A cerebral mass and some intestines that sprout cannot dissuade to the majority of the followers of the artistic movies.
The majority of the fans of the action they die of boredom, if Unojo catches a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of missionaries cristioneros violent by interpretable motives and remains stalled an eternity in the calm and the fog before its team arrive at America and to be silenced again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" have not found film distributor in Germany and alone be published in DVD.
Is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody facade, hides a piece of at times stimulating movies, that deserves something of attention.
This movie does not try dialogues neither of a logical action, all is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into movie.
And therefore there is not loophole for the spectators.
Refn itself condede barely a moment of relaxation and its glacial images and the gloomy soundtrack of trance do him a knot in its throat, above all, the incredible hatred, that since the hearts of the personages goes toward him.
Alone a small blond youth, that supports to Unojo faithfully, preserve something as innocence, all the others are possessed by the ira.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, whose motives are not explained never, is converted at any moment in a warrior left the hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
The it represents the perdition, but perhaps alone for the ones that they are lost at any rate.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and to admire, to be annoyed, to be altered and to be surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of land
The organization of nuclear energy OIEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country rejects to think on this theme until controls be permitted.
On the average night from the 5 to September 6, 2007, at least four battle Israelis airplanes F-15 I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
He is found in the edge of Euphrates; the more nearby and greater city, 30 kilometers he is Dair ace-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Agency of Atomic Energy (OIEA), treats on a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with aid of North korea in the bucket, hidden in a valley that the river leaves.
According to information of the international intelligence service of United States of the CIA of the end of April of 2008, themselves design a current reactor under the name of the proximity of the-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with the one that the nuclear weapons are built.
On the other hand, the technique barely serves for other end that for those of the fifties.
The CIA showed a presentation in video with images of blurry satellite.
They showed with an animation by computer where were the components of the reactor before the destruction, that was a copy reduced of the North Korean model of the nuclear power plant of Yongbyon.
Besides they taught photographs that showed the building since the proximity or since the interior.
It did little time that the reactor was in operation, says, but yet was not equipped with bars of fuel.
Today, three years later of the bombardment, barely best-known that by that then, the enigmas were done greater with the time.
The previous president of the United States, George W. Bush was watchful recently in his memories that before the attack the CIA was completely insurance that the Syrians had built a reactor in the-Kibar, but that barely he saw indications of that in the country to exist "a program of nuclear weapons."
In Europe, various agents of the secret service prefer to be still more prudent and alone they speak of a "supposed reactor," although they consider "acceptable" the presentation of the CIA.
They lack you test solid, as well as to the OIEA.
When him he was asked the sure thing that was to consider before a reactor, a high diplomatic one of the NU he responded in summer in a lapidary way that the OIEA has "sufficient material to have questions."
The Syrians were undone with a lot of rapidity of the debris of the presumed one "military building rendered useless" and they leveled the land conscientiously.
Nevertheless, in June of 2008 a team of the OIEA under the command of the previous chief inspector Olli Heinonen found rastos of uranium in the-Kibar, that had been manufactured for people.
Besides the OIEA obtained images by satellite on a member state, of commercial salespersons in the just moments after the attack, that should have a greater informative value of the ones that presented the CIA.
Nevertheless, these photographs did not arrive at the market because an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them in an exclusive way.
Therefore the OIEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always gave understand that never had had a secret nuclear program neither built no reactor.
The uranium proceeded of them you arm Israelis, explained Damaskus.
The OIEA rejected it as improbable after the analyses of the particles.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss on the matter, in the same way that with respect to the images by satellite.
Besides, to the controllers itself them prohíbe a second inspection in the-Kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the building bombarded.
Also Israel guard a strict silence.
"Never we will comment it," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in functions at the moment of the attack, confirmed recently the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not given results from June of 2008 and "is transformed progressively in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a western diplomat of high-ranking official corresponds with a place in the OIEA in Vienna, finally he is alert a serious infraction against the tried not proliferation of atomic weapons, by the one that watches the OIEA.
The OIEA considers three teams more as the key for the progress in the clarification, that should be "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor, and other like these still they exist.
The inspectors have not brought to light publicly up to now of what teams they treat, neither what functions have, neither if suspects seem.
According to the periodic one Süddeutschen Zeitung, the OIEA has appointed as internal to Marj ace-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, of new by-product of the proximity of the cities situated.
The independent one Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with the images by satellite, that very probably be a matter of one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly he is found in or immediately next to a Syrian, military base prohíbe with this motive the entrance to the three places to the OIEA.
In Vienna he is said that the Syrians fear a registration that the United States have requested to the OIEA to spy the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were on the alert on the teams thanks to the warnings of the secret service of the United States.
By means of photographs by satellite, the OIEA has indications that itself material transfer between the three places and the bucket to the edge of the Euphrates.
A western diplomat with a high-ranking official in Vienna affirmed that at least one of the teams can be "related to the production of fuel."
But there is not "no indication of sensitive activities," neither of enrichment of uranium neither of overhaul; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven with uranium that be not enriched.
From where the uranium should come and where should be separated subsequently the plutonium for the bombs, for these central questions there is, in the best of the cases, acceptable suppositions.
Do neither there is doubt on if the ruins, the valuable trails that can be recovered, they are found in the three places.
As disappeared the hundreds of load of the trucks of the floor, nobody has information on where do they remain the debris.
The OIAE considers improbable the mine of salt al-Tibni, situated in the few kilometers since the-Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, that the Syrians recognized in 1998 by their aptitude as zone for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the OIEA, related it to the reactor in an analysis of the images by satellite for the prestigious magazine Jane' s Intelligence Review.
But the photographs since the orbit show that the Syrians performed movements of lands in the three supposed suspicious places and they eliminated large tenants after the OIEA requested the entrance.
It can be coincidence but barely contributes to dissipate the suspicion.
Besides, in the diplomatic sector he is said that the OIEA there is employee some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrians to permit, for maintain the possible alone, military secret the unfold sample the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus criticizes also this proposal.
The western diplomats in Vienna a year ago calmed down with which the reactor already was destroyed, therefore the matter does not have a lot of urgency, for a pair of months, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador of the United States uses the calls exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous media than the Viennese nuclear authorities they have to establish the controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the OIEA, that should propose these inspections, he has spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but still hesitates.
This road very is risked: For it the majority of the counsel of government of the OIEA is needed, and some of the 35 countries there represented they are not exactly anxious by an escalation.
On the other hand, as reflected a diplomat: "¿And what happens if in the end they do not find anything?"
The love in the times of the war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of its still nameless début.
She same has written the hyphen, a history of love between a Bosnia and a Serbian.
Itself it is not known a lot more on the matter, but this is sufficient for the agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Moslem, falls in love with its Serbian violator during the war of Yugoslavia.
The associations of women Bosnias have protested quickly, with which in the last moment transferred some days of filming planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The movie has rolled itself in Hungary and in the posproducción, but still there is protest in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the female organization of victims of the war wrote the High Commissioner of the UN, ACNUR, by Jolie and he requested an encounter with the actress, he informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the High Commissioner of the UN for the refugees.
It is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him an encounter in Hungary that rejected.
The encounter took place in Bosnia, affirms Hasecic.
Itself not histories of love in the fields of violations are given, and the position of Jolie on the matter betrays the victims the sufficient thing on the hyphen.
Its organization according to the High Commissioner of the UN for the refugees has recommended to dismiss to Jolie as the ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what has written exactly Jolie for the scenes?
The department of Bosnian culture that read the hyphen, offered after a bargaining a permission of recording in Sarajevo, is not of the all clear reason Jolie went not in spite of all.
The young woman author reiterates that does not pursue political purposes with its movie, is introduced with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavian conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to give voice to all the parts implied.
Its content continues being inexact.
In the network circulates a second synopsis of the movie that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the beginning of the war and they be found again when she, a Bosnia Moslem, is a deportee to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant one "victim of violation falls in love with tormentor."
Is insurance that the movie of Jolie begins really before the war.
The pressure on her, affirms Jolie, is "unjust and based on erroneous information."
At present they can achieve the peace with the hackers of Hollywood: While the hyphen continues in the network in an illegal way, as many other previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon at last is again good for the Irish.
No trace of affliction
On the other hand, the home team dominates on its clients of Sweden, Finland and United States.
The fans shout of happiness while resounds the high music, they strike the floor with the feet.
The club Bailey vibrates in the sudirlandés Cork, because the players are launched, and they find, balls of pingpong to the glasses of beer since a distance of three meters
The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong," and the prize for the winner are 500 euro more some plane tickets to The fertile plain for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cyan Tanner is a tranquil type, this eccentric play of beverage and the discreet data processing one in reality do not do good crumbs.
And the boy of 26 years tries to be entertained with that, to be distracted of the explosive question, what will grant him the future.
The diversion in The fertile plain is not in its plans, in January will carry out a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a badly premonition," affirms.
"Is very far from house and not yet I have work there."
At least: Its girlfriend expects him in Auckland, "of a he threw he obtained the work of his dreams as management committee of events, perhaps be a good sign," the youth says and sonríe.
On account of the bad perspectives at home, two of the three brothers of Tanners already have sought luck abroad.
Its sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, its brother Colin works currently as the advisor of YOU in Londrés.
The youths go: In the island there are many families as that of the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will abandon the country in a nearby future, they foretell the experts in economy and the institute of social investigation ESRI of Dublin.
Until 2015 200,000 emigrants are counted.
A great loss for this small country with alone 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, a comparable migratory wave comes to which suffered the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that trajó a great welfare to the Irish, currently extends the melancholy.
The economic crisis confuses above all the youths, Irish well formed, for the ones that up to now, all is uphill.
The loss of employment and the social descent seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
All they need that there be plenty of money.
But three of each ten men and women less than thirty years are in the unemployment.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in mass of young emigrants, that complain that: "In Ireland all sinks."
"There should be a lifting against the politicians and the bankers, but who is able, goes and loses our country and with it to an entire generation."
"The last one that close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the union of Irish students he sees to appear a somber future because the alone government is dedicated to assemblies and no longer offers perspectives of future to the young people.
"They reduce the minimum wage, but do not have strategies to achieve new jobs," affirms the girl of 20 years.
It observes as its companions go of some practices not reumneradas to the following.
Its greater worry, explains, is to have that to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People as Stephen McLarnon try to see this theme in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a fair that offers a service around the theme to work abroad.
"For the ones that they begin to work, to do it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," affirms the manager.
In their web page photos of a boy practicing surfing in Australia appear and of another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like to do it in the wagons, if does not that involve liberty and diversion.
For half a year, Seán OR' Donovan knows how is to build something in another place.
Since no longer it had swum that to do for the engineer of 29 years, at present works with 15 Irish companions in the construction in Germany.
Now they raise a fashionable store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January goes to Hannover or to Berlin, to the following project.
Or' Donovan sees its country only few times because works overtime to be able to pay a credit for its house in Ireland.
"The situation is a little lunatic," he affirms, since a long time ago of the first time that stepped the threshold of his house.
"I win money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which never I am so well."
Laughs somewhat ashamed and goes for rooms frosts.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with cares gardens before the houses, in the entrance they are parked expensive and large cars.
Or' Donovan bought the house along with its sister four years ago for 380,000 euro, 100 for a hundred financed by a credit.
"They were crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.

Or' Donovan thinks a while, serves more hot tea and says: "Do not I have children to the ones that have that to feed and I am a youth; if all leaves badly, I can begin from zero."
To the civil engineer do not he they like the complaints that listens often at present.
"Nobody should pass hunger, our situation he is not, with a lot of difference, so dramatics as in passed times here in the island," he affirms.
"To work a season abroad is not the worse thing than can pass, perhaps with it we feel for the first time as the Irish."

The democratic routine
Continues enlarging the support to the democracy in Latin America, as well as the endorsement to the private enterprises.
The delinquency generates greater worry that the unemployment.
Besides, to a large extent of the region, Brazil is seen like a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarómetro carried out in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
It given that the survey has been celebrated regularly since 1995, permits to carry out a monitoring of the changes of attitude in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and principles of October, they emphasize two questions related.
The first one is the reigning relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes toward the democracy and its main institutions.
The support to the democracy has enlarged considerably in diverse countries of the coast of the Pacific of South America (consult the board 1).
For example, in Peru, where the economic growth has reached an average of the 6% annual since 2002, the support to the democracy has enlarged since a reduced 40% in 2005 to the 61% this year.
Grew also in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a great descent of the production last year.
Nevertheless, so alone the half of the polled of Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries of the zone, are democrats convinced, which low the regional average (consult the graphic 2).
Around the 44% of the polled in the region they were declared satisfied with the way in which the democracy functions in practice in its country, the same figure that last year, but considerably over the 25% registered in 2001 (graphic 3).
Around the 34% it affirmed that they trusted in the Congress of their country and the 45% in their Government, the same quantity that last year in both cases, but considerably superior in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turmoils in Latin America affected seriously to the support to the democracy.
The fact that have themselves maintained during the world financial crisis probably themselves due to that numerous so alone Latin-American countries were seen affected by a brief recession and they enjoyed a strong recovery.
Besides, the existence of a social network of stronger security has contributed to protect to the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of latin-Americans that live in conditions of so alone poverty increase marginally in 2009 and that this year has been reduced again, to the 32%.)
Nevertheless, the state of spirit varies considerably from a country to another (consult the graphic 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its departing president, Luiz Inácio Lanky gives Forest, reflects itself in a general feeling of progress.
Said feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and they have enlarged the violent crimes.
For the second time since they began the surveys, more polled in Latin America they mention the delinquency, instead of the unemployment, as the most serious problem to which is faced its country (consult the graphic 5).
Around the 31% it affirms that, be they or a nearby relative, has been a victim of the delinquency in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since the 38% of last year and that is the smaller registered percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic performances are reflected in a greater support to the private enterprises and to the market economy: around the 71% of the polled in the region they affirm that the private enterprises are indispensable for the development, while in 2007 only was the 56% (consult the graphic 6).
Around the 58% it agrees in which the market economy is the only system that will permit that its country develop, set against the 47% last year.
It turns out to be interesting that the 62% of the polled in Venezuela they think the same thing (and the 80% supports to the private enterprises), although its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is the country that exercises a greater leadership in the region, just as indicates the 19% of the polled (set against the 18% last year), followed by the United States (the 9%, same figure that last year) and Venezuela (the 9% set against the 11% a year ago).
Nevertheless, United States is the most influential respected country by the polled in Mexico and great splits of Central America, while Venezuela shows off such title in Equator, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
Nobody expected that the general elections celebrated November 28 in Haiti fuesen perfect.
Nevertheless, they elapsed of an a lot worse way of what the foreigners were feared that try to help the country to mend after their problems.
Votes in the ballot boxes were introduced, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in the drains, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The electoral colleges opened with hours behind schedule.
Numerous Haitian, inclusive groups displaced persons by the earthquake of January, they wandered around the zone trying to discover where had they to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen candidates to the presidential, included several of the more popular, they denounced fraud and they asked the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, they extended for all the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the official of the United Nations of greater rank in Haiti, declared that they were "some relatively good elections in many senses."
The observers of the Organization of American States and of the Community of the Caribbean affirmed, with caution, that "do not we think that these irregularities, by serious that be, they nullify necessarily the process."
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, that according to its opponents is compromised with René Préval, the unpopular departing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results December 7.
It is foreseen that the breakthrough will be carried out in January.
Not yet all the hopes in relation to the elections have been lost.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, they have withdrawn their initial petition in which they requested the nullification of the voting.
But still problems can arise if the electoral authority declares that the Mister Célestin, that barely has support, if has some, has passed to the second patrols.
Keeping in mind that the epidemic of the rage devastates the country and more than one million of the survivors of the earthquake continues living in stores, expects a great abstention.
It arrived the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do it due to a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 documents of identity, necessary to vote, yet they had not been distributed little before the elections.
There is a lot in play.
The donors of aid consider that the election of a legitimate and popular government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, has remained patent, also the own Haitians think it.
Advancing on tiptoe toward the center
In the weeks that have elapsed since lost its husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has enlarged its index of popularity in 20 points, to more than the 50%, the major level that has registered since its election in 2007.
In spite of all, that can become a campaign successful for a second mandate in the elections of next year will depend on if the clearly affected lady Fernández leaves sideways the intransigence of its late husband, its predecessor and political associate, Néstor Kirchner.
And, on this point, the indications are not conclusive.
The Mister Kirchner, that continued being taking charge of the economic politics even after its wife him to happen as the president, had the custom of devising budgets that undervalued the fiscal incomes, the economic growth and the inflation.
This permitted to the presidential marriage to spend the additional incomes to its discretion.
In theory, the government of the lady Fernández lost its majority in the Congress last year.
Nevertheless, the opposition is divided, a situation that has got worse after the death of Kirchner on account of a heart attack October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in being able have been faced the lady Fernández.
Nevertheless, after some chaotic sessions in which a representative gave a punch to another in the face and other representatives accused the government of bribe, the Congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," the president said.
The budget of 2010, consequently, will apply to the next year, what will offer the president a still greater room to maneuver at the moment of to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably grow to a 9% this year.
The rate of official inflation is found at present in the 11,1%, but numerous private calculations, besides the salary demands of the unions, they situate it near the 30%.
The Mister Kirchner, that assumed the power in 2003 when Argentina was to the edge of the economic collapse, did that the growth and the reduction of the poverty fuesen its priorities, instead of the control of the inflation.
It refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured to the private sector and did that the INDEC, the institute of statistics, adapted the official statistics of inflation.
It will moderate now the president Fernández these politics?
It has called meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
Besides, its officials affirm that they want to limit the salary increases next year to the 18%.
The economy has been seen prompted by the high prices of the agricultural exports Argentinas in the world.
Nevertheless, the inflation has limited the impulse to the growth obtained with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps by it is reason the lady Fernández is giving signs to wanted to restore the financial links of Argentina with the remainder of the world.
To starts of the year, the government arrived at an agreement with the holders of bonds that had refused a prior compulsory restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not credited in 2001.
Currently, it seems that the lady Fernández is on the verge of celebrating an agreement with the deserving governments grouped in the Club of Paris, to which owes around 6,700 million dollars.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not imply the supervision of the IMF, as is used to being habitual.
Nevertheless, Beloved last month Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical support" to devise a new national retail price index, which the prelude to the cleaning of the INDEC seems.
Does not it remain clear if the President Fernández wants to continue in the politics when finish its mandate, keeping in mind that no longer has its husband to its side.
If it does it, will need to be won the support of the middle class, great part of which has itself tired of the kirchnerismo.
When the Argentines return from its summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy by she there will be decayed.
If it wants to win other elections, will have to decide if repudiates or not, with tranquility, many of the politics of its husband.
Medium hooray by China
The voters of Taiwan are approaching slowly to a more nearby species of union with the continent.
What thinks Taiwan on its great brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, the 70% of the eligible, they responded November 27 to elect the mayors and councilmen of five urban districts in which an extensive evaluation of the president seems, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mister himself Ma has returned a defender of the feelings by the continent, forging innovators business links, including a pact of free partial commerce, the major changes in the relations with China since 1949.
The Mister Ma passed the test, but nearly.
Although its they parted Kuomintang (KMT) finished winning three of the five elections to city hall, failed to obtain the majority of the votes.
In its place, the democratic progressive Party (PPD), that has inclined for a total independence of Taiwan, obtained practically the 50% of all the votes set against the 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential, the Mister Ma would be in problems.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has diminished in about a 8%.
For the first time, the PPD drew with the KMT in the City Hall.
In the elections the typical elements of the taiwanese elections could be seen, including noisy trucks of campaign and large conglomerations with flags and scantily clad girls dancing.
Did neither it lack the mysterious severity murder intent.
Be they Bundle, the son they to Bundle Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was doing campaign for one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shot the youth directly to the face, wounding him and killing a passer-by.
The curious thing is that themselves has not been able to be determined if the man intended to do him damage to they Bundle or to be avenged of the candidate.
In any case, he says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the cross-fire he affected to the elections, sowing you suspect on the PPD and causing that the voters inclined for the KMT.
Perhaps the unique one great winner of the campaign was China.
Turned out to be surprising that itself did not treat the matter of the continent in itself.
In their place, the candidates spoke of plans of public lodging and creation of employment.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat of China.
Consequently, the KMT is used to avoiding to give publicity to its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time also the PPD avoided to encourage the feeling against China.
Responds to the new conscience that the Chinese commerce is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
In turn, the Mister Ma affirmed that had been confirmed that its politics with regard to China was acceptable for the majority of the Taiwanese.
It is foreseen that the Government of Beijing continue bribing them with the commerce, according to its strategy to achieve that Taiwan return to the sheepfold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of the investments and the medical cooperation.
Without doubt, he would like to obtain likewise the political integration, but the first thing is the first thing.
The best will be to wait for that even the presidential elections of 2012 for it.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was found in a bad situation: his old leader, Chen Shui-bian, he was imprisoned defendant of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigated openly the explicit independence.
Nevertheless, under the leadership of the lady Tsai, a new generation of moderates has arisen and the PPD is endeavoring for attracting professionals and young.
The lady Tsai has been received pleasantly as the candidate of the PPD for the presidency, just like Its Tseng-chang, that complied low mandate Chen.
Now its party is doing everything possible by showing that can also have relations with Beijing.
The lady Tsai announced the plans of creation of a group of experts that act as point of contact between the PPD and Chinese, provided that they can be carry out the negotiations without prior conditions.
The lady Tsai tells the taiwanese public that its party represents a "reliable alternative" to the hasty focus of the Mister Ma with regard to China.
The Mister Chen seems furious by the change.
In a statement emitted since its cell, affirmed that the candidates of the PPD had left better stopped if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even the Mister ordered His, a pragmatist, that he did not present to the presidential.
Even without the Mister interceding Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose among its possible candidates.
The KMT should also do an exam of conscience.
The appraisals of the Mister Ma have been poor, in spite of the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to do campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems due chiefly to the unemployment and to the growing differences between rich and poor.
A spokesman of the KMT affirms that he will restructure his cabinet, as well as the home teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to an approach is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwanese they consider that the economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an acquaintance columnist, "already himself there is crusader the point of do not I return."
Nominations to the Grammy: the Hope jazz singer Spalding is the election surprise in the revelation Artist category.
It acts at the request of a president and possibly the people will notice you.
Hope Spalding, the bassist and singer of jazz of 26 years selected personally by the President Obama to act in its ceremony of the Nobel prize of the Peace in 2009, supposed one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination of highly level in the category of Better Artist Revelation.
Keeping in mind that Spalding has been a praised figure of the jazz since its album of 2008, "Hope," the nomination gives what to think, but respects the norms of the Grammys according to which should be an artist that have not removed to the market more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of said artist."
Their ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," without doubt supposed a great advance and, keeping in mind their light vocal style and pleasant, as well as a great ability with influences of pop music, funk and latin American rhythms, themselves at least can establish a distinction between Spalding and the road toward the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent most nearby one for the voters of the Grammys, that ultimately they have themselves It concentrated on the environment of the jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy did honor with reason to "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio, an exciting and magnificent disk that was one of the favorite last year.

Trombone Shorty, a shrill favorite one in New Orleans and habitual guest in "Treme," of the HBO, was honored in the category of contemporary jazz, that by the remainder inclines considerably toward the fusion as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The punk savage of Darcy James Argue' s Secret Society obtained a deserved recognition in the category of large groups, being of concern against the great jazz of camera of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the always risked Dave Holland, whose album in alive with its octet, "Pathways," was a great example of the democratic leadership of the bassist in its band.

The proposed mosque in Temecula obtains the approval of the commission of code
The project of mosque for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the commission of local code after more than five hours of often heated, public testimonies.
The critics attacked the project saying that promotes the terrorism and the jams.
Nevertheless, the members of the commission decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive since the esthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show his support, so much Christian like the Jews or bahaíes, of all the religions," he said Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of the valley of Temecula, Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as American citizen, prides me."
"It shows that the justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimum," adds.
"Alone that speak very high."
"In this valley there is marvelous people."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted practically to average night; most of the time was dedicated to people that interceded in favor or against the center, practically the same quantity in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the newspaper.
"United States no longer exists," reads itself in one of the comments.

The opponents still can resort the project before the town Council.
A resistant microbe to the arsenic plant the life of new forms possibility in the Land... or in other places
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can utilize the arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the new possibility to find forms of life in the Land and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the investigators discovered the curious bacteria here in the Land, they say that shows that is possible that have you form of life without the main elements that considered essential.
"This agency has a double capacity."
"Can grow be with match or with arsenic."
"That becomes it something very peculiar, although little lacks him to be a life form type really 'alienígena'," commented Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, coauthor of the report that appears in the edition in line on Thursday of the publication Science.
Since time ago, is considered that there are six large essential elements for the life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the match and the sulfur.
Nevertheless, the investigators have discovered that the bacteria, found in Cute Lake, California, can continue growing after substituting the match by the arsenic.
"It causes present you you what more is possible," affirmed Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, coauthor of the report.
As it indicated Anbar, the find is important for the search of life in different planets from the Land, given that the investigators need to be able to recognize the life, to know the aspect that has.
The study itself center in a discovered microbe in the Land.
Nevertheless, the assembly of a press conference to debate it, in which itself not details of the discovery were divulged, generated a great speculation on the Internet on the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not it do.
What the discovery "yes shows is that in other planetary environments, would be able there to be agencies that utilize other elements to prompt their biochemist and that the assembly of elements" standard" that we consider indispensable for the life perhaps be not so fixed," commented Chat Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, they Bid for University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell did not form part of the team of investigation.
"This work is novel because shows the replacement of an element by another in the biochemist and the basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not carried out for coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the institute of astrobiología of the NASA, that directed the study, was centered in the Cute one Lake because presents high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and the match are similar since the chemical point of view, for which speculated that a microbe exposed to both would be able to substitute one by another.
"The arsenic is toxic chiefly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of the match."
"Consequently, it can turn out to be complicated to the agencies to differentiate them."
"Nevertheless, the arsenic is it sufficient different as so that function not so well like the match, for which enters and, by telling it of some way, compresses the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
The investigators collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and they exposed them to concentrations each greater time of arsenic, to which they managed to adapt and they utilized to grow.
The microbe grows better with match, but the fact to show that can live with arsenic in its place plant the possibility that can exist of natural form a form of life that utilize arsenic, whether in other zones of the Land or in another planet or moon where the arsenic be more common.
Jamie S. Foster, teacher to help of microbiology in the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that can be substituted the arsenic by the match is not new, but never an example had been found that showed that functions.
The arsenic was more common in the first you were of the Land, indicated, for which the investigators speculated that the first forms of life should have used.
"Yes that suggests that they would be able to exist other media to generate life, not alone the way in which the life was formed in the Land old," indicated Foster, that did not form part of the team of investigation of Wolfe-Simon.
The investigation included the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The dogs have been found stolen that lacked in Compton
The two dogs have been found that lacked of the four stolen set against the motel Bellflower, they as affirmed the officials of the sheriff of the county of The Angels Thursday.

"They are in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, neither the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is being carries out."
"We do not mean anything," affirmed Whitmore.
"We are continuing some trails."
Themselves he could not be found the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, so that they did some comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a refuge of animals of the county in Downey Wednesday afternoon.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs by separated in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Draw, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog of 10 months) had not suffered damages.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the competitions of the zone this week in name of the Japanese owners of the dogs, continued disappeared persons until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, that live in Redding, they were in the city for the national championship AKC/Eukanuba in Long Beach this weekend and they intended to exhibit to Draw.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions predicted for the prior days to the championship AKC/Eukanuba, as indicated Peek to The Times Wednesday.
The south of California is one of the stops in the tour of practically two months that carries out the couple participating in competitions dogs.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard did the check-or in the motel.
Normally they remain in motels and they park the just van set against the window of their room.
They carried to other three dogs (a young of boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and a Brittany, that slept with them in the room of the motel.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and they would be more fresh.
They left the slightly open windows so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard denounced the robbery of the van Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to any that could conduct them to the Corgis, gifted of microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear if a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, to the time that the restructuring of MGM obtains the final approval of the cut
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has obtained finally green light to begin again.
Thursday, a federal judge of bankruptcies of new York approved officially the plan "prearmado" by the creditors to erase approximately 5 thousand million dollars of debt, leveling the road so that the company of entertainment of 86 years focus its efforts in the production and premiere of movies and programs of television.
The failure on Thursday confirms that the plan complies with the demands of the code of American bankruptcy, for which not other legal obstacles exist so that MGM itself flirtatious remark under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that will become the executives main of what will be a study reduced.
The personnel will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM not the Chapter will leave 11 until JPMorgan Chase close an instrument of credit planned of 500 million dollars, to finance the operations and productions of the new one MGM.
The investment bank at present is unionizing the credit, that by its account is contributing with 75 million dollars, and it is expected that be financed in the middle of December.
The process of restructuring of the study began in May of 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the necessary management for order its finances, while fought for be able to carry out payments of interests for 300 million dollars to the year.
In the month of August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovery of businesses in bankruptcy, known by its work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial troubles of MGM and to satisfy to the more than 140 creditors of the study, requirieron a lot more time of the expected.
After various months of discussions, at the end of 2009 the parts they agreed to put the company for sale.
Nevertheless, the auction attracted to few postores and none willing to pay the more than 2 thousand million dollars that sought the creditors.
Before the spring of this year, returned at the table of design while the team of MGM began to work in a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, finally was supported by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially the bankruptcy in the next weeks leave, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive bonuses multimillionaires by its work.
Moelis and Co., that already has received 1.2 million dollars, will obtain a payment of 9.5 million dollars.
The companies of Cooper, that have been collecting 375,000 dollars for month by their services of administration of the company, they will receive some "honorary of success" of 4 million dollars.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume the production in MGM, that premiered only a movie this year, and met an annual shale of seven or eight movies that will leave in 2012.
Also they plan to finance jointly two movies based on "The Hobbit," along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to arrange a loan separated from among 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its part of those two movies, that will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, that possesses approximately the 18% of the debt of MGM, had been trying to fix a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
Nevertheless, the recent conversations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the equilibrium of its budget for gifts
While the iPad is the main candidate to be the most marvelous toy of this year, followed by, perhaps, the system of videogames Microsoft Kinect, both can signify a significant notch in its budget for gifts.
Consider that by the price of an iPad five bicycles can be bought BMX of 99 dollars each one, and a play Kinect costs the same thing that 10 cords of classical leap adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 tin platings of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to maintain its budget for gifts in equilibrium.
Recently I visited three salespersons of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ' s Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than 80 dollars.
It was immediately of course the Law of Moore has been working; the technological toy of this year probably will have more power, costing the same thing and even one little less compared with that of last year.
Besides, while generally there is less new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And the toys prompted by batteries of button are enlarging, as well as the toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here there are some recommendations.
(All the prices are of Toys "R" Us, unless be indicated otherwise).
The Sing-to-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are toys of plush of the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when its bellies are pressed.
A squeeze equals to a note, and a second squeeze begins to assemble a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Precaution: Once it begins to press, cannot stop.
For song combined with dance, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60 dollars, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking lent of the technology of Elmo Live of last year, the dummy animatrónico of 14 inches plays shift change play as Simóm Says, and can do the lunar step, thanks to its innovative feet articulated with wheels with device of blockade.
The children that tested the toy used to Mickey as an instructor of dance, although its parents complained for the lack of a control of volume.
If you are a boy of the years 80, can recall to Alphie, one of the first educational toys computerized.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, 40 dollars, for 3 years and more), with a full backpack of letters of questions designed to convert a drive in a session with a notebook of exercises of autocorrección witty.
If you are fearful to give him its boy its intelligent telephone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars, from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest one and the easiest one to use, presenting a keyboard qwerty; although the play do not teach with as much efficacy as the Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, from 3 to 12 years), is the first one put ready important of the line Leapster, with a brilliant and newer screen.
Any version is compatible with the old cartridges.
IXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the type iTunes to present play and electronic books, and has a groove for cards SD that permits to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a play of five barely more large blocks than a box of matches, each one with its own screen LED.
The objective is to assemble words placing the blocks in row before the time finish; is formidable for an unscripted competition of armed of words.
They are each time more the toys that have some class of connection in line.
It based only in its presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
Buy from its son a pet in line in the Club Penguin, for example, can obtain a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, (5 dollars, from 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you trade the code in line, its son obtains sufficient credits in the store of the Club Penguin for two articles.
These they would be able to include skates on wheels or a toy pet Puffle.
Slightly more large than the bristle of their brush of teeth, Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last thing in a line of microrobots they prompted by batteries of button.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It is amused to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if can find the exit.
Is also lasting.
Ours it was capable to leave the table of the kitchen and even to pass a while inside the mouth of our dog.
A side is promoted more moderate of the maintenance of the order in China
As a sergeant urban instructor, Tang Shenbin kept time in a plaza of the city, inspecting with severity to the nervous people to its charge, emitting orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted that the female members of chengguan, the corpulent police officers of the urban order of China, feared and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to the violence, they communicated a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"¡Firm!"
"¡Attention!"
Show them, whispered, "how are the pretty girls!"
Four girls that barely passed the adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and adjusted pants to call the attention.
Four peers of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly over the hair tied with white and blue striped tufts.
"Personally, I think that they have a normal appearance," he said the Mr. Tang, disdainfully.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered that all the new conscripts have a title of degree.
The Province of Guangdong changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a blue supposedly more attractive one.
Wuhan, in China central, substituted the use of the force by intimidating looks: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officials surrounded to an unruly cart of snacks, and they observed him with the frown gathered constantly during half an hour, until the traveling salesman collected his things and he went.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has elected a change of radical image.
Since 2003, the district has aggregated its urban police 13 women, explicitly chosen by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give him the rough police a female, smoother side.
Sadly, to Scarlett Johansson would have that to fight to enlarge the negligible respect of China toward these squadrons of the city.
And by a good reason, they would argue the critics.
As opposed to the police, these officials are authorized only to cause to comply ordinances of the city, imposing fines and other administrative griefs.
But the media of Chinese news portray in a routine way a different reality.
In January of 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed blows to a passer-by after to have used their cell one to film them while dissolved a protest against a dump of waste.
Last year, a manual of formation for inspectors of Beijing was stolen and published on the internet, in which was described like to whip with efficacy to delinquents without causing to bleed.
This year, a traveling salesman of watermelons of Shanghai suffered cerebral damage after a fight with five officials.
A play of full video of violence, available to discharge in line, presents inspectors coached by the Chinese that attack out-on-the-street salespersons.
"Chengguan has left a scar in the government," regretted China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy on tactic.
The newspaper required "a really meticulous cleaning."
The skeptics say that the current focus is very far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female conscripts in October, an editorial one in The Beijing Evening News was asked if the women had you owe real or they were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little both things.
The notice of the district asked female candidates from 18 to 22 years, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial characteristics."
They should consider a height over the average, over 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retreat at age 26 is obligatory.
The officials said that the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"His image is the important thing," an anonymous official from district told to Rednet.com, an almost governmental website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they comply with the requirements, like height, weight, facial characteristics, etc."
Later the temperament comes "and the interior qualities."
The chengguan female are like flower pots, he said, and he added, "besides being flower pots, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of administration of the city of the district, is not anxious by supporting that description.
But it observed that the demands of height were standards in many notices of Chinese work for both sexes.
Then the demand of harmonious facial characteristics comes.
If this signifies to be handsome, is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled person or disfigured should not be presented.
"We cannot permit that a lame person or a hunchback they come to work here," the Mister said Zheng.
"Its image would not be well."
Liu Yi, who patrol the Plaza Baoguang near a monastery, is 22 years old, with its red cheeks and a mouth subtly curve.
She does not believe that the accent in its aspect be sexist, said.
"¿You believe that I seem sex appeal with this uniform?" asked with a sardonic look.
Its coworker with dimples, Xu Yang, of 21 years, he said "Our work should present the image of the city."
They are neither opposed to their work to specific time, they said, because shelter ambitions of greater career that simply to scare away salespersons in the alleys where is supposed that they circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron is faced more or less to a dozen traveling salesmen that are launched on foot or in bicycle, trying to sell so many rolls or mugs of tofú as be possible before being thrown.
"Mister Wang, has to be gone."
"¡We have said him many times!" said the young lady Xu while a salesperson escaped on foot, abandoning temporarily his car thrown by bicycle with garrisons of noodles.
The officials describe their you owe as more monotonous than exhausting.
"This is more or except the same thing each day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who studies marketing in its free time.
"Very routine."
A reason is that the female officials lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the merchandise of the salespersons.
Only they can threaten to denounce the offenders to their supervisors men.
This tends to protect them of the sudden public demonstrations of animosidad against the bureaucracy, that are common all over China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, they rebelled after itself to spread the false rumor that some official chengguan had murdered a salesperson.
More than a dozen police officers or official chengguan turned out to be injured in the nocturnal episode; 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or turned on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm barely is guaranteed.
Only to two streets of the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where the female officials patrolled that tomorrow, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being paid attention to the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as requires the regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle shouted rudely.
The situation was stopped for 15 minutes before the officials, with expensive evil, be to opened step to the nudges to their vehicles and they were themselves quickly with the motorcycle and their owner.
Li Xuedong, of 40 years, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with its white insignia given return to hide its name.
As the female officials, the coordinators, men of 40 years or more, they play a role purely of support.
As opposed to them, itself is not taught them to maintain an elegant image.
"At times we fight verbally."
"At times we fight physically," the Mister said Li with total naturalness.
"Most of the time is the public the one that begins the fight."
The public prosecutors will not raise charges against the Senator Ensign
The lawyers of the senator announced Wednesday that the public prosecutors of the Department of Justice have exonerated the Senator John Ensign of the criminal accusations that arose of their affair with a former assistant of campaign and their efforts to assure work by means of lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision finishes with the most serious legal threat than faces Ensign, the Republican of Snowfall that was considered as possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on its affair had national holders last year and damaged its career.
The office of Ensign said that felt "surely I please" by the decision, that arrived after an investigation of an entire year.
The senator still would be able to face a disciplinary measure of the committee of ethics of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice there was us "reported that the Senator Ensign no longer is an objective of its investigation and that has no plan to raise charges against him by this theme."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many lawyers of ethics out of the Department of Justice, that said that seemed to have you test significant to indicate that Ensign would be able to have plotted for violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
The interviews, the e-mail and other documents that were divulged in the first place in October of 2009 in the New York Times they indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its assistants, to obtain I work lucrative by means of lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and its wife, Cynthia, on the affair of the senator with her.
The lady Hampton once worked as a treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign was put in contact with various political sponsors to find him work to the Mister Hampton and fought in name of them after they had hired the Mister Hampton to do lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had been recently an assistant of Ensign, he was excluded according to the law to do lobby for his former employer or the Senate during a year.
The experts in ethics said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, that were intimate friends before the affair, appeared in disagreement with the call "revolving door lobbying ban," that seeks to restrict that former state employees use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has done himself public, "seemed to be a case cousin facie of a conspiracy to violate substantially the statute revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington that specializes himself in defend clients investigated for the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, the Mister Brand and other lawyers of ethics said that the department seemed cautious at the moment of to accept political prosecutions after various important reverses for its section of public integrity, including the decision of last year of abandoning the prosecution against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in the middle of charges By bad conduct of procedure.
The federal public prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," he said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for the Responsibility and the Ethics in Washington, a group of defense that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically it signifies that the officials of the government of highly rank now can suppose that the laws do not apply to them," added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, he said in an interview that received a phone call of a public prosecutor of the Monday Justice Department and another call more the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against its client.
The team of defense of Ensign had been cooperating with the public prosecutors in the attempt of persuading them that the senator, like its office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted according to the law."
Coggins refused to explain with detail the legal arguments that gave the public prosecutors.
"Do not I feel comfortable entering details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, alone I can say that we think that they decided just," he said.
Last month, the Federal Commission of Elections decided to change an investigation in a complaint separated by the group of ethics, that alleges that a payment of 96,000 dollars of the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated the electoral federal law.
The electoral commission said that did not have sufficient tests to show that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Snowfall that had supported for a long time the senator, which obtained work by means of lobby thanks to the aid that Ensign gave to Hampton.
A sent e-mail in December of 2008 showed that after the company accepted to Hampton as lobbista, the leader of cabinet of Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and told him that was "pounding" the Interior Ministry on a question in dispute.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another client of Snowfall, Allegiant Air, and called the secretary of transportation to establish a meeting in name of the airline after had hired to Hampton for do lobby.
When by first the news of the affair appeared last year, Ensign asked pardon to its voters and renounced its position as room Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a reduction profile during many months, two weeks ago Ensign told the journalists that planned to be advanced to a third mandate in the Senate.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign no longer was object of a criminal investigation, said that the senator expected that the committee of ethics to continue quickly the example of the Department of Justice and to conclude his investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has desires to continue with its difficult work in name of the people of Snowfall," said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim at Twitter
There was half a dozen of them "drinking wine" in the rows of the room of the court.
Minute to minute, sent reports of the frightening testimony way Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there was more than 140,000 messages of Twitter on the process that undertook the violation and the children tied to its beds in a house that was turned on fire.
Thursday, the process extensively followed by Steven J. there you is, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to arrive at an official end, with the imposition of the judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of the Mister there you is have presented writings in the cut that delineate the arguments of the appeals that probably will occupy to the courts during years.
One of the most provocative it affirms that the intense reports on the process, included the extensive use of Twitter on the part of the massive information media journalists, created "an atmosphere of circus," and such saturation generalized and immediate with details exaltadores did that the public passions to exercise an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim would be able to oblige the judges of appeal to fight with the question of if the new technology requires new rules in the room of the court.
"According to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a true danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the room of the court is affecting the rights of the individual to have a just process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, main lawyer of the defense of the Mister there you is.
The judge of first instance Jon C. Blue, of the State Upper Court, rejected laconically the demands in a failure last week, saying that the media of news were "carefully controlled" and that there was not any proof that the jury have been carried by the passion.
But probably will not be the last word on the theme.
During decades, the courts of appeal have recognized that the cover of cases celebrate can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historic failure of 1966, the Supreme Court U.S. revoked the prison sentence of an osteopath of Cleveland, the doctor Sam Sheppard, by the murder of its wife, saying in its decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that there was "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the mass media.
He is believed that the crime had been inspired for the program of television and the movie "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals that examined the prison sentence of the Mister there you is half century later, they would be able to be felt plotted by the argument that could be necessary new rules to control the form of communication since the rooms of the court, something inimaginadable in the epoch of the case of the doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general motive of worry on the impact of the new mass media" in processes of high profile, he said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the School of Laws of Stanford, that studied the death penalty of Connecticut and he wrote a report in which he was told that this was imposed arbitrarily.
The professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal would be able to be felt plotted by the idea that to limit the immediate communication since the rooms of the court would be able to do that the judgments were more just.
The question of Twitter is only one of many of the themes delineated by the lawyers of there you is, that probably they will be discussed during years, delaying an execution.
The lawyers of the defense also affirm, for example, that there you is would be able to have been damaged when the Judge Blue refused to permit them that they tested the reactions of the potential juries, showing them photographs espeluznantes of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, of 48 years, and their daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
The lawyers of the defense say that also they will question the constitutionality of the death penalty and they will maintain that the judge incorrectly removed to a jury that had criticized the public prosecutors, and that incorrectly he had pressured for a verdict by his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate during a weekend.
The juries were not kidnapped.
But its arguments on the effect of the intense cover of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates for governor and the Senate U.S.
They argued that the mass media continuously threw firewood to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily conglomeration of the tweets of the media, the cameras and the reporters out of the court," they wrote the lawyers, "something went never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Its attention in the cover of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the immediate news were more important than the reports delivered more slowly, they were a vision ludita that would do that the politics of the court on the control of the cover was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal often felt attracted by the arguments on the adaptation that was required in the courts due to the technological and social changes.
The lawyers of there you is they are pressuring for that claim.
In their writing, they referred to the decision from 1966 of the Supreme Court, that revokes the prison sentence of the doctor Sheppard due to the cover of the process, and they left in of course they would require that the new media would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Is able the public-spiritedness to spread a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a notable campaign by the invective and the negativity, this week has unchained itself a little public-spiritedness in Washington.
Is an omen of a genuine future two-party cooperation or a false moment before a fast return to the partisan battle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress produced no advance in the large themes that should be treaties during the departing session.
But for which they say all, was at least a courteous discussion on the differences of the two parts, as well as a recognition of its responsibilities shared to govern, instead of be another empty episode for win points partidistas.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the commission of deficit of the president likewise was civilized, in spite of the political differences that subsist among the members.
The interaction seems of course I tighten during a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates to the members.
That is barely sufficient to declare that has arrived a new one was of cooperation.
Now both parts are in a trial period, being tested mutually to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, while they try to evaluate the limits of the public opinion and the patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
Motive by which the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluations of the same one on the part of the participants were done with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and they are very deeply established like to suggest any fast change of the climate that existed during the last two years.
Whether that be a matter of taxes, expenses, health care or helps social, the two parts are found in opposite poles.
At any rate, the election of November smooths out the humor in Washington, at least short-term.
"There is not any doubt that the things have changed with respect along the lines of saying the things," he said Even Wehner, an official of the administration of Bush now in the Center of Ethics and Public Politics.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections awake partisan passions, that then they are extinguished.
That is good."
In some questions, particularly in those that figure in the order of business of the departing session, the Republicans and Democrats do not have another option that to find a solution.
The reductions of taxes of Bush are conquered in the end of year, and nobody is in favor of this.
Both parts want to find a way to preserve some or all the reductions, of permanent or temporary way.
In the same way, is probable that there be a commitment to expand the subsidies of unemployment, probably because the Republicans cannot cause to believe that they are in favor of the reductions of taxes for the rich, denying the subsidy of unemployment for the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism by a possible deal on these themes during the departing session, along with the ratification of the new pact of nuclear disarmament START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, of the Institution Brookings, notifies that the successful cooperation in the urgent questions of the departing session they will not conduct necessarily to a continuous bipartisanship when the new one 112do. Congress gather in January.
It affirmed, on the contrary, that is very probable and even inevitable, that comience a period of disagreement.
"After the things that should cause they are carried out, short-term the psychology will revert the situation to an of confrontation" affirmed.
Also Wehner expressed skepticism (which extensively is shared) on the fact that the public-spiritedness can conduct to a true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen among now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," affirmed.
The motives have a lot that to see with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters of the Torch Party, that contributed decisively to its creation.
By more conscience than they having the Republican leaders on the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they should try to comply their promises of trimming the expenses of the state and to annul the new law of health.
Those partisan lines already are observed clearly in the initial reactions set against the recommendations of the commission of deficit, that include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and of the retirement age, and the cut of expenses.
The cochairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles itself responsible for one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to its own appraisal, they have introduced by force the question of the deficit in the public order of business in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been fighting for arrive near that figure.
The greater resistance is among the chosen officials in the board, suggesting that in fiscal questions there is, at least at present, few bases or desire for the commitment.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles among the Republicans of the White House and the of the Congress.
The first one will happen next year in the shape of partisan collisions, when the Republicans challenge to Obama on the budget, the taxes and the health care, succession then by a period of greater cooperation bipartidaria.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is test considerable that, in spite of the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two together parties working.
If the confrontation conducts to a break-even point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe with attention the reaction of the people.
Whoever that consider that is losing probably will change course and will seek commitment.
Nevertheless, this can be an optimistic vision.
The partisanship and the polarization at present are greater of what were in the middle of the years 1990, and there seems to be a larger ideological hole between Obama and Republicans of the Congress of the one that there was between the President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in its moment.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
It given this reality, the civilismo that this week is shown can be welcome for many Americans.
But this will require a lot more effort on behalf of both sides to find points in common in the questions that still divide them.
An American document filtered portrays to Moscow as the paradise of the corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "cleptocracia," and leaves a part of the bribes and money of protection that collects directly to the Kremlin, as reported in February the American Embassy in Russia.
It was reported that so much the police as the Service of Federal Security they handle enormous systems of blackmail, what helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only of legitimate business, but also of criminal groups organized.
Each stratum of the bureaucracy, what the prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical authority," takes its part to the extent that the money rises in the scale.
The note, that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks in its website Wednesday.
The note is based on whose sources names have been censured.
He was written while Yuri Luzhkov still was a mayor of Moscow, and he blames him by great part of the corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev said good-bye it in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and its wife, Yelena Baturina, that possesses an important business of construction, have denied systematically the accusations of corruption along the years, and he has earned several demands by libel on such accusations.
In September, when in a Russian television channel they asked him on a documentary one that suggested that was corrupt, affirmed: "Is an insanity, a tall story, a disgust."
According to the surveys, the Russians believe in an oppressing way that its company is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the report of the embassy, and is unheard-of that be the diplomats of a foreign country the ones that do that.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with the criminality have carried to some to call it 'dysfunctional', and to affirm that the government functions more as a cleptocracia that like a government," affirms the note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and of the mafia that literally signifies" ceiling" or protection) that transfers the police, the Federal Service of Security (SFS), the Department of Internal Matters (MVD), and the office of the public prosecutor, as well as all the sectors of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identify a structure of three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the higher."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are in the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are in the lower level."
"This it is an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fill an empty one in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report affirms that the SFS collects the money of the largest businesses, and that the police aims at the small commerce.
A source, affirmed the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that the best is to obtain the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the groups of the crime organized) since they do not only have more you arm, resources and to be able that the criminal groups, but also they are protected by the law."
"By this reason, the protection against the criminal gangs is not one more priority."
The note observes that, while the collection of money is complete, the protection can be irregular; even the ones that pay are subject to the arrest.
Those that do not pay quickly they find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against the corruption, but has confessed that has achieved little progress.
The note of the embassy reports on men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the same one Kremlin.
"In its fight against the corruption, Medvedev has to trust in the bureaucrats," affirmed Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts of Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political establishment, because no longer a political establishment in Russia exists."
Without the politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, affirmed, the corruption is inevitable.
To national scale, Indem estimates that the corruption costs to Russia more than 300 thousand million dollars per year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified in the position 154 (the countries are classified of the less to the most corrupt one).
The revelation of the note of the American Embassy, that not hour of Moscow occurred until late at night, surely will cause displeasure inside the Russian government, and in spite of the fact that Luzhkov can be blamed for the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity so that the Kremlin argumente that is solving the problem.
It interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks could be lies and reacted furiously by a revelation that affirmed that the American diplomats called it Batman and to Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic politics in this country," affirmed.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this itself would have done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that to be done in a way so immoral."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge obliged to face the past
In a concrete classroom weakly visionary, with walls stained and peeled, the director of the Secondary School Anlong Veng recalled the man that had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Here all they love Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he worried about his people," he said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Known as "the Butcher" by its brutality during the government of the Khmer Rouge, the commander continues being popular in this remote former fortress of the Khmer Rouge in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where still thousands of former soldiers of the organization live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge be to yielded before the government, the loyalty maintained for a long time finally is being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and the reconciliation permitted the victims that faced publicly the people that had participated in the state.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia emitted the first prison sentence of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing the former leader of the central acquaintance of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known like Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each one of those events, the anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for the reconciliation and its intents of being returned to the Cambodian company.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they cannot do anything," affirmed Chhang Youk, director of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia, an independent organization that investigates to the state.
"For them, the life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the state has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions inside the families."
During the government of the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, they were executed or they died of hunger, illness or excess of work, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and they ousted to the government headed by Pol Pot, the remainders of the state and his soldiers fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted to the last movement that was yielded in December of 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla warfare since its bases in the mountains and the forests of Cambodia western, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the years 90, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN conducted to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Khmer Rouge began to desert toward the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, he was captured by force of the government in 1999 in the nearby Mountains Dangrek.
It died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while expected the process.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest combatants of the Khmer Rouge fell in the absolute misery that is common in the Cambodia rural, and many feel nostalgia by the movement.
Although a few officials of elite of the Khmer Rouge conserved their local administrative positions in exchange for deposing its weapons, the privates continue being poor farmers and done not qualify.
"This people has obtained few benefits after the surrender," affirmed Sok Leang of the Center for the Justice and the Reconciliation, that offers public forums for every Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agrarian ideology of the state."
"They were servants without no concept to do business."
Sister Lim, of 55 years, who joined with the Khmer Rouge when was an adolescent in 1974, he fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to the life as the farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"The life with the Khmer Rouge was well," affirmed.
"Ta Mok fed to all."
"But now the life is difficult because we have to be self-sufficient."
The current court of the Khmer Rouge has also caused worries here.
At the beginning of the next year, it is expected that the court comience to process to Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and its wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate of the court is that of processing the main leaders and to those of greater responsibility by the crimes, but has not said if will pursue cases besides those four.
This done not it serve of a lot to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has been centered in Im Chaem, of 64 years, who was a leader of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Khmer Rouge to ends of the years 1970.
In 2007, she told him the investigators of the Center of Documentation of Cambodia that had supervised the construction of the prey of Trapeang Thma, a project in which thinks that they have died thousands of workers forced.
During a recent shameful afternoon, Im Chaem returned to work in the fields to its house on steer of wood in a dirt road on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the lean pasture, Im Chaem refused to speak of its past in the Khmer Rouge.
She affirmed that if the court called it would not be presented.
"Cambodia is in peace and stable," affirmed.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
The prime Minister Hun Are, that deserted of the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also notified repeatedly that there will be instability if the court pursues to more suspicious, although the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and to bury the past" affirmed.
But to face the past is exactly what Cambodia should do to advance, said Chhang Youk, of the center of documentation.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to unite again the broken pieces" affirmed.
"It is our obligation to meet these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first textbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, call "TO History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school history textbook of the Department of Education, that contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng knows few details on the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the link of the city with the state.
Touch Valeak, of 19 years, a student in the Secondary School of Anlong Veng, he said that the new textbook helped the students to understand an important part of its history.
But its parents reacted with skepticism when carried the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he affirmed.
"They have you suspect because they are not sure on the quantity of people that will process the court."
Such resistance has done that the process of reconciliation be complex and difficult, affirmed Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are beginning to produce an impact, affirmed.
At any rate, here the Khmer Rouge conserve a powerful charm.
In the Mountains Dangrek, a road with too many weeds and covered with plastic bags rejected conducts to a rectangle of the black soot covered by a ceiling oxidized of tin.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a salesperson of cell to the edge of the road, he said that not a lot about the man knew that was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray him," affirmed.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the place of the last rest of Pol Pot, where would leave a bunch of mature bananas with the good hope to have luck.
Belarus accepts to renounce its reserve of uranium qualified for armament
In an unexpected victory for the campaign of the president Obama to protect the nuclear material everywhere, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that will renounce its reserve of uranium highly enriched, a critical component of the nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint tax return published after the Minister of Exterior Matters Hillary Rodham Clinton itself to meet with the Minister of Belorussian Exterior Matters Sergei Martynov, to the margin of a summit of security.
Per years, the American government had been trying to persuade to Belarus that renounced their uranium highly enriched and seemed that they had arrived at a point without return last spring.
But the American officials told him the Washington Post that they were carried out a pair of operations classified with Belarus in the two last months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for armament of an installation of Belorussian investigations.
This paved the way for the agreement on Wednesday to withdraw the remainder of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, that spoke since the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the theme.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear Security of 47 nations presided by Obama in April, that excluded to Belarus.
And by it it seen was a good achievement to assure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the following summit in 2012.
"Really I felt fascinated by the circumstance of that wanted a place in the Summit of Nuclear Security of 2012."
"This shows that this process is functioning," affirmed Ken Luongo, president of the Company for the Global Security, a group that promotes the nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April of 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all the vulnerable nuclear material everywhere in the next four years.
Since then, the American government has helped six countries to be get rid of all its uranium highly enriched.
Belarus would be the seventh one.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Summit of Nuclear Security of Obama, the Belorussian President, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation never would renounce its uranium.
"We have conserved the uranium highly enriched (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for armament) and the uranium of low enrichment," affirmed Lukashenko just then.
"This it is our commodity... we are not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them to him nobody."
"We use it with end of investigation, is all."
Nevertheless, Belarus approached the United States some months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials affirmed that the first task to withdraw the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, since the material slightly had been radiated.
The officials said that was loaded in a special train that travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the officials, the second operation finalized Monday and was done in airplane.
The American government spent 13 million dollars for the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply him to Belarus the installation of investigations with uranium of low enrichment, that is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy that works in the Reduction of Global Threat, he said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated with a lot care to fortify the confidence" that conducted to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies reckoned this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for armaments, as well as hundreds of kilograms of uranium highly enriched.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reserve toward 2012, according to the joint tax return.
The relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense per years, chiefly due to the rough repression of Lukashenko of the human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential distension.
It was declared that "while is received with I please the progress in these global security reasons, the United States and Belarus recognized that a greater respect by the democracy and the human rights in Belarus continues being a central theme to improve the bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA
The Spanish Government did not put objections to the flights of the CIA with prisoners Talibans and of al-qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram the ambassador of US in Madrid.
Thus the documents filtered reflect it (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper The Country, where is added that the then vicepresidenta first of the Government, María Teresa Fernández of the fertile plain, asked that the Spanish Executive was reported for "to be able to show that they exercised an appropriate caution on the foreign airplanes that cross Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Counsel of Europe in which he accused of complicity in contrary practices to the human rights to a dozen countries, among them Spain, a meeting between the former American ambassador was produced Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of the fertile plain.
The vicepresidenta recognized that the report of the Counsel "had caught to the Government of Shoemaker away" and insisted that Spain did not have anything that to hide in this matter.
"Of the fertile plain underlined that Spain does not have objections to the flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be reported" to avoid to be "caught unprepared," relates Aguirre in a cable.
Also the then holder of Outsides, Miguel Angel Moratinos, indicated the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this matter the possible lower profile, although, upon being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence."
In turn, in January of 2007, the fiscal one Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask the disqualification of the documents of the National Center of Intelligence (CNI) and of the department of Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain no incriminating element neither any sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the public prosecutor.
Nevertheless, US reflected its worry by the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German public prosecutors," more than by the information declassified of the CNI or of the department of Defense.
"This coordination among independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly among Governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March of 2007 in a lunch between the ambassador of US and the home secretary, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this commented that "although the Spanish judges are furiosly jealous of their independence and they will do what consider adequate," he had given instructions to their collaborators "so that avoided comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an intent by lowering the temperature."
The ambassador also express train its worry by the action of the Popular Party in this matter.
"Despite its general orientation proamericana, our experience suggests that the Popular Party will not doubt in capitalizing any indication that the Government of Shoemaker tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of US that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of US," indicates.

The popular they would win 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the Popular Party could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increment of votes and experienced representatives in the recent regional elections, the Popular Party Catalonian already has the view put in the generals therefore, there be advancement or not, the perspectives are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those assemblies is used to doubling to which receives in the Catalonians.
Thus, the popular Catalonians obtained 610,473 votes in the generals of 2008, while in the autonomous of 2006, the figure elevated to 316,222.
The past Sunday, the PPC achieved 384,091 votes.
To be maintained this upward trend, that has been nourished of a transfer of votes of the PSC and of the fidelización of the electorate of the Popular Party, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were celebrated, the PPC would be able to pass from 8 to 12 representatives in the Congress, while CiU would win also four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 representatives (has 25).
These calculations would verify that the Catalonian plaza is fundamental for Popular Party and Spanish Socialist Party.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a representative - now has three - while ICV would remain with a representative or would win one.
But, to be maintained the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will be produced in May of 2011 with the municipal assemblies, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and in its changeover at the front of the Delegation of Barcelona, one of the administrations that more budget handles - 661 million euro for 2011 -.
So much nationalist as popular they coincide in the possibility that the PSC lose the City Hall of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not obtain majority neither possibility to resort to their traditional associates, ERC and ICV.
It given the republican fiasco, would not be absurd that this formation lose its representation in the town Council of Barcelona - is needed to obtain the 5% of the votes -.
The Popular Party has increased its figure of votes in the four capitals and could be forces decisive in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to star in the upset in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the Popular Party before that the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Crossbowmen.
In Lérida, the Popular Party has been situated only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they were found in several occasions.
The popular have grown also in other important municipalities as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
At present, the Popular Party been present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalonian cell facilitated thousands of passports to To The Qaida
Besides the seven people under arrest in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian people under arrest by agents of the General Precinct of Information of the Police in Barcelona formed a cell yihadista that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups from To The Qaida, among them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author this last one of the attacks of Bombay that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the extent of assuring that with the "operation Kampai" has remained "weakened" the apparatus of forgery from To The Qaida to international level and, "therefore, its operating capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were fake and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy To The Qaida so that their "combatants" can cross the European borders and of other western countries with total impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the unique one that the network yihadista had operating in Europe, from there that in the investigations they have participated, besides the Thai services, other European police units, for which is not ruled out that in territory of the EU they be carry out in the next days similar blows upon developing in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were people under arrest the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian one Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand developed another with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai one Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These they were the ones that directed from Bangkok the cell written down in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalonian network - splits of her was struck in 2009 - stole chiefly tourists passports that complied with the requirements marked by the call "World Islamic Front."
That is to say, the documents should be to name of males from among 25 and 45 years, with a validity of various years and without visas stamped.
In the investigation is underlined that, for the time being, itself no data has been found that link to them arrested in Catalonia with the attack of Bombay, despite that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba," have been one of the groups receivers of the passports stolen in Spain and then fake in Thailand.
Nevertheless, one should recall that days before to be committed this attack, from Catalonia were envoys through an agency of transfers some thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of phone cards that then were utilized by the members of the "command" that to put an end to the life of 106 people.
The Police has been seized of abundant documentation.
The Popular Party requires to But that park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday to expose him personally to Artur But its conditions to support its investiture as the president of the Generalitat, identical to the already presented during the campaign and that itself summary in give priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with adventures edge-soberanistas, like is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to present in the equator of its mandate.
The president of the popular Catalonians responded to the encounter of Artur But with the security that gives to have obtained 18 representatives in the elections of the past Sunday, more than sufficient figure to cause to want, therefore the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that they will exercise the opposition he abstain in the voting of investiture.
Of a possible entente with the Popular Party the future alliances depend that the nationalist quieran to maintain in the Congress when general elections be celebrated, but, for the time being, the conversations that these days maintains But with the remainder of political leaders they are done in Catalonian key.
And as for the president of the Popular Party, to support an investiture "there will be that to park all the speeches soberanistas and pro-independence," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends even to submit to referendum.
Both leaders yes have in common its bets on to make thin the political apparatus of an autonomous administration very inflated and the elimination of the tax of successions and donations.
Of the details of the negotiation on the investiture of But they will be occupied, on the part of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has met already with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - that promised a hard opposition -, Joan Blacksmith (ICV) and today will do it with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalonian).
The geriatric one affirms that the deaths were not by "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that its guard killed more than 11 elders
The responsible for the geriatric one The Caritat of Olot (Gerona) they offered yesterday a press conference to put of relief the damage that has caused to the institution the criminal conduct of Joan Despicable Dilmé, the nurse that while was there employee killed the less to eleven elders that had to his charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Room, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the desire of The Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the head" of the deaths but "the legality and the responsibility oblige us to assume the legal situation of civil heads."
And the fact is that besides the social loss of prestige that can suffer the company by not to have detected to time the criminal activities of the guard, the great threat for The Caritat charges now forms of substantial compensation that already they are calculating the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Despicable Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August of 2009 and that since then has not left to kill.
The judge already aimed in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the geriatric one - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor explored personally the dead but, attending to the age and to the pathologies of the patients, the procedure he attended to himself by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied yesterday flatly this extreme and aimed that "the lack of measures may not have been at no time the cause of what has passed."
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in the cause there is not a single indication that he have there been an imprudent action on the part of any another person that do not be the own one attributed."
The already it baptized as "Angel of the Death" confessed day before yesterday 11 murders and he detailed that the first crime committed it August 29, 2009 for, a month and middle later, to kill a second grandmother.
In this case caused the death puncturing him an overdose of insulin, as opposed to the first crime that committed it being helped of a mixture of sedative tablets.
The director of The Caritat aims that he is complicated to control that the personnel of the center have access to the medicines.
The punctures of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives would have been the employed mechanism in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the internal, used to give them death.
But they will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory the ones that should clarify if Despicable does not he lie and he sought for its first victims a death less cruel or if, on the contrary, he parched them inside giving them lye as already has confessed that did with the three women that killed between the 12 and October 17.
In The Caritat do not they give credibility to the demonstrations of the guard, neither so even to the number of murders confessed, that do not they rule out that be superior, and they justify its attitude in the different versions that has given Despicable in its visits to the court and in the little sense that has that change its way to proceed after to have committed, with success, eight murders.
That it is why they say that they are put at the disposal of the justice to clear the reach of this event.
The ECB threat
The investors reacted unceremoniously yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet that notified "the markets should not underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of peripherals have closed with force and the actions of the European banks have risen more than the 5%.
Nevertheless, we should neither underestimate the capacity of the ECB to be mistaken and the euro barely has improved which is a worrying sign.
What has been produced yesterday is own of a market ilíquido that the same as collapses recovers but motivated by closing of very speculative and short positions.
The institutional investor will delay in losing the fear.
A month ago the ECB cited us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the ones that remain.
The Bundesbank required to finalize the public debt purchase plan by ineffective and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit and leaving so alone unlimited access to week.
After the Irish crisis we expect that they defer the measures of current liquidity "at least until March" and they maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access in the end of the quarter to guarantee the liquidity at least to June.
Also we expect that they continue with their bonds purchase program and even that give the sign to intensify it.
If they do not comply with the expectations generated they will revert the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind in withdrawing measures of liquidity, ¡that God attend us!
Just like in its meeting of May in which they affirmed that they had not neither contemplated the purchase of bonds and they paralyzed the markets, tomorrow would be able to be repeated the history.
The ECB should be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday said that already had bought a lot, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The alone Treasure emitted 500 million to the 5,28%, versus 750 million to the 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in all the curve, reflecting clearly a market feeling change after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has done itself public the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The figures reckoned are some 10,000 million short-term and other 15,000 potentials and they have to February to obtain private capital or they will remain nationalized.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility after detect not the problem in July with the test of stress, the figures are acceptable inside the Plan of Aid and they help to reduce the uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain the parliamentary approval of its new budget and not yet has sufficient support, for which Ireland continues being a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of its speech to relax the tension with a view toward the next Summit of Heads of state and of Government December 14 in which is necessary a political commitment that show that we are a union and that all we touch the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch to Wagner and the remainder the hymn of the happiness of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president had the gift of the opportunity upon presenting yesterday the plan of measures that will approve Friday the Cabinet.
It reforms of pensions, transparency in autonomous regions and financial companies, reduction of the deficit, liberalization, privatization, measures to revive the employment sound in ears of the investors as the four stations of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Market have risen the 4,5%, the double one that the remainder of European Markets.
As opposed to February, the reaction of the Government and of the Bank of Spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting us of the effect surprise.
Today there is a key auction of a bond to three years that will be seen benefited by the effect Trichet for which we expect that be resolved with strong demand and help to dissipate the doubts on our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask a Plan of Aid would be an autoinmolación.
They would give us a line of liquidity that do not need, the Treasure have more than 40,000 million in available liquidity the triple that in March, to very expensive types and the access to the markets closes you sine díe.
Nevertheless, the strategy should continue being that of the woman of the Caesar, "besides being it, to seem it."
Spirit, we are able.
The president of Eulen will challenge the meeting of fertile plain Sicily requested by its children
The temporary one does not abate in the open conflict in the family Álvarez, owners of Eulen and The Juniper.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, upon considering it "null of full right," the judicial meeting of The Juniper of the next day 16, requested for five of their seven children and in which they will try to cause to be worth their majority and to be done with the organs of management of the regular firm of wine Cellars fertile plain Sicily.
David Álvarez and their children Jesus David and María José they are tuning up the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their lawsuit by the control on behalf of the group.
The founder of the major holding company of business services to the business does not seem willing to yield in his lawsuit for been present in the organs of government of The Juniper.
Of its board meeting was unseated by five of its seven children that administrators in the assembly of shareholders of 18 of January of this year were named and whose challenge is noted in the business Register.
The judicial meeting of The Juniper for the next day 16, called by the Number the Commercial thing judge 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunders in the breast of the family Álvarez.
The resource to the judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict be resolved, the legal only mechanism that guarantees the assembly of the meeting.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is qualified by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants its five children for, by means of legal sophistry, in clearly fraud of Law and abuse of right, to try to validate and to reorganize the radically null meeting of January 18," according to its official spokesmen.
This argument will be the base so that, once celebrated the meeting, proceed to its challenge upon considering that is "null of full right."
The same protagonists, that maintain a discreet silence, already they tried without success that the judge called in June a meeting.
In The Juniper, hereditary company and fertile plain wine Cellars holder Sicily, among others assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control the 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services demands, nevertheless, the use on the 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This matter is the question of fund that should decide the judge once be celebrated the view on the demand of challenge, for the one that still there is not date indicated.
Network Bull succeeds in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in the real-time cars.
Since Network Bull burst in the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of the velocity has been marked by the surprise and by the success.
In a first moment nobody took in consideration the options of a motor-racing team recently arrived and, in spite of the ascending path of the last seasons, the past November, in the final straight line of the championship all they bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of the Fernando Alonso.
Without desmerecer the ability as the pilot of the finally champion, the German one Sebastian Vettel, neither neither of the capacity of the motor one Renault that propels its car, in the world of the Formula 1 has become a legend the "arms secret" that the multinational Siemens has placed in the hands of Network Bull to become a team winning.
It treats in reality of a powerful processes simulation software that the German put in the market in 2007 with very far away end of the high automobile competition.
It called PLM, this powerful data processing instrument has been utilized to design assembly lines of manufacturing factories everywhere, plants of energy, instruments of highly precision.
The objective is to reproduce, to simulate of faithful form the product or the process before building it of real way, avoiding in this manner failures and avoidable expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, of the airplanes of Sukhoi or of the most famous cars compact cars of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this data processing instrument in its factory of Formula 1 has permitted to Network Bull to design and to carry to effect "in few hours, almost real-time," the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the careers and in the trials.
Russwurm explains that the motor-racing teams in the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their team that were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
In the team of Network Bull work today 180 professional youths of highly cualificación that, equipped with powerful data processing teams, they analyze and they project every luck of modifications in the racers.
The executive of Siemens explained that to the software PLM is capable of analyzing and to improve all the elements of the racers of Network Bull with exception of the motor, that is of the entire responsibility of Renault.
The materials they are modified, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of security.
The changes can be carried of the virtual reality of the flight simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by means of laser and autoclaves of highly technology.
As only limitation of this insanity of the technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each team of Formula 1 can spend at most in each season to facilitate the competence.
Network Bull has mounted the factory of highly technology to design and to produce its racers in a locality at some 50 kilometers from London.
It is a matter of two buildings in which they are restricted the visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that there happens is respected "high secret."
The staff for this assignment elevates 580 people, included its two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Network Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the mark of energy beverages has placed to the service of its participation in the circuits, they hide other protagonists whose contest is invaluable and its null notoriety.
The leader of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago could be affirmed that the advances of I + D in the cars of wagons contributed the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the remainder.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology adds the 85% of the success, while the pilots contribute the 15% of the value added.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber never will be substituted by the data processing since "are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona their first exclusive store in contribution they are their associate Pont Kings.
This it will be the first one of the network of 20 commerce from among 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational foresees to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will harmonize this initiative with the 16 areas already presents in central multimarca as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and The English Cut.
The vicepresidenta of HP Spain, Greek Blacksmith, put as an example it remodeled store located in the Great Way of Barcelona, property of Pont Kings, with whom collaborates since 30 years ago.
The American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 mark sale points in Europe in 2013, strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first in opening were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being that of Barcelona the third.
Blacksmith did not want to be watchful the following possible openings, although recognized that Madrid could be the following destiny.
The also director of HP personal systems assured that the philosophy to install the stores will be always the same one, being supported in a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The American group assesses and takes charge of the design exclusive furniture of the stores (with products that can be touched of interactive form), that in Europe they will have an identical image.
Besides, HP covers the formation of the personnel of the establishments.
Greek Blacksmith denied that he was a matter of a system of franchise and he emphasized that the exclusive network of commerce intends "to improve the service to the client and to the pymes in the purchase, the attention, the post-sale one and even the packing."
The store of Barcelona includes a space with a pioneering pilot program on a worldwide basis that takes charge of resolving the possible problems of the data processing teams of HP in guarantee.
A service online connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"Thus, in 10 minutes we can settle problems that at times can delay to two days."
"This system is designed especially for pymes and users, since the large businesses already have hired technical support," rebranded yesterday Greek Blacksmith.
Sabadell bets on 'to steal' a million clients to its rival in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the delegated counselor of Bank Sabadell, Jaime piggy bank, he believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but rules out initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of the passive one.
Despite it, it foresees a collapse of the margins of interests, that will try to compensate in part with ascents of commissions and of the price of the credit.
Sabadell expects to grasp in three years a million private clients, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the three next years and to be able thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will set in motion in 2011 a new plan director that will have a force of three years.
The objective, besides surviving without need to resort to the public aids of the FROB, is to win market share with the collecting of a million private of new clients -700.000 if the ones are discounted that can leave the bank-, its great pending subject, since up to now had spoiled more to the pymes and businesses that to the retail client.
This year has grasped 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share particularly is of the 3,5%, while in businesses surpasses the 10%.
Another of the bases of the plan 2011-2013 is the bets on the productivity, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with reduction of prices as objective, and whose challenges the bank will expose them when present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to be set some objectives and to make public since the financial crisis has switched all the plans of the world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its plan director Optimizes, set four years ago, although initially was for three, but the situation of the markets did that will expand it an exercise more.
The clients that leave to escape the savings banks will be its main objective.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, piggy bank insisted that 2011 is going to be a year "difficult and transcendental."
The executive, in fact, he believes that the exit of the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Besides, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create employment," somewhat fundamental for the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the passive one -that penalizes the margins- is being reduced, the price of the cousins of risk that are paying banks and boxes by their emissions to obtain liquidity they are being transferred already to the price of the credit for compensate the fall of the margins.
"The theme of the liquidity and the financing is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"We have not closed the faucet, but the differentials are higher," recognized piggy bank.
Banesto already gave Thursday orders to its network so that they limit the long-term credit and they rise the price of the differentials -to see CincoDías of the 22 and 27 of November-.
Also it recognized that the tendency of the banking now "is to rise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of Sabadell is based on the organic growth, although, as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, it assures that in Spain "are going to require greater sizes."
"Next year is going to move all," assured.
It affirms that the needs of capital are "risen a lot" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial company among in the red.
And it aims that the FROB can supply to the market in the fundraising before new recapitalizaciones.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary closing of the markets, reduced importance to what some bankers predict already as a new crisis of liquidity.
It indicates that itself cannot be emitted, but contrary to what occurred in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, what cushions the crisis.
The MINT rules out a second wave of fusions in the boxes
The general director of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that be going to produce a savings banks fusions wave and insisted again in the velocity with the one that the restructuring of the sector is being executed.
When it started the process of concentration of the Spanish savings banks, were several the companies that assured that would not participate in this first phase and that would be reserved for the second patrols.
Nevertheless, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of savings Banks (MINT), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations be going to produce.
"I believe that the largest part of the fusions has done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Civic Banking cannot be told that be a second patrols, what there is are adjustments."
"The majority is completely fact; that instead of 17 we go to 13 ó 14 but all the large processes have done itself already and protected by the Bank of Spain, that in that has collaborated a lot also," aimed the executive.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executives and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is being attacked "to possible the greater velocity, and we have to be very satisfied of as goes producing in the time limit that in its day, not now, they were marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain," emphasized.
"To pass from 45 boxes with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that does not have comparison in the history, reducing the number of companies in a 62% so that they be a lot more large to comply with Basilea," stood out.
Olavarrieta recognized that "they exist a series of fortunate quite little opinions on the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and of sense," because "what does the Bank of Spain is to recall that we have to be inside the time limit before end of year."
The general director of the MINT, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system from across europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed to whom they put it in fabric of judgment a "lack of knowledge."
The executive aimed that, inside the current economic joint, "we can be very tranquil" with the situation of the financial companies and of the savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "important" and that "goes to possible the greater velocity."
Also it recalled that the Spanish banking turned out well stop of the tests of stress that carried out the ECB in July.
Tough and the German hotline
Berlin has opted for being maintained in the euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
The tensions in the markets have caused a double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new measures of adjustment, fiscal from reductions to the pymes, regulation of private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euro of aid to stopped without installment, to the privatization of the 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Packs and The Prat and of the 30% of Lotteries of the State.
By another, the vicepresidenta Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president Felipe González, has added to the criticisms to the cancillera Angela Merkel by its responsibility in untying the current crisis.
How one must interpret those movements?
Go in front that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative politics.
On the contrary, is another return of nut in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, that collides with that of maintaining the old traditions of good part of its associates.
Set against the European resistances, in Germany begins to be speculated on the three possible exits to the crisis.
The first one, a strong euro, comprising her same, Austria and Holland, among others countries, while the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now science fiction seem, with a current of very favorable opinion, close to the 50% of the population.
The third one, an I redesign of the euro, in line with the proposed Germans of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary severity, fines to the countries transgressors, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the prices of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and comes being defined since time ago, so now do not fit excuses.
First, in the 2009, when so much the IMF as the European Commission they stimulated the déficits, the German Government was removed of the sleeve a constitutional reform to impede them from the 2016.
This it was the first sign of divergence among what Germany believed that should be done (plans of fiscal severity and stability in the public finances), and what were practicing their European associates, included France.
The second in the front gave it the Central European country when Merkel extended arduously the decision of rescue of Greece.
Already then it was object of ferocious criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and it published they were very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, of NEW Merkel emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the tried the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, to oblige the private lenders to run with part of the price.
This position has been interpreted like antieuropea, since has hasty the Irish crisis and all it others.
But his proposal, although a little sweetened, has been approved and, in the next months, we should attend the process of reform of the Union that enable those measures from the 2013.
Germany has designed a hotline that does not think to cross.
And it is telling us all that, although now have that to take measures with the ones that perhaps is not very in agreement, from that date the old operation of the euro, there will be itself finished.
The 2013 it will signify the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries offenders will be severely guilty people, they can be obliged to be declared in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the price.
Germany is indicating us that we should continue a severe road of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in the consumption, improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and positive exterior balance.
Another alternative based on the debt and the construction, with enormous holes in the scale of payments, like the one that has presided the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, simply it do not they be going to tolerate.
The envite is clear.
And we would do badly in understand it not.
Itself does not it treat alone to bring back the public deficit to the 3% in the 2013.
What require is us a lot more hard.
And the worse thing than under the circumstances we would be able to cause is to deceive us ourselves.
I expect that the current turmoils leave step to a greater tranquility.
And that we take advantage of the window of opportunity that have given us, to the spring of the 2013.
It seems that the Tough president has also understood it thus and its double manifesto (the reforms promised after the meeting of last Saturday with the large businesses and the announcement of yesterday of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, road has been opened the thesis that one must sort out house.
But the hotline that Germany has designed there is, and does not seem that they be going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of abandoning a monetary zone too much overstuffed of serious little countries, cannot be excluded.
Then, Germany will always be able us to say that already had notified us.
Sport and fraud of law
Tricks as those of Alonso and Branches before the Ajax show ingenuity but not will to escape to a sanction.
The expulsion presumedly warped by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Branches) in the party disputed November 23 against the Ajax in the League of Champions has caused that be written rivers of ink about if such behavior is or not antideportivo and if, eventually, both players should be guilty people by the UEFA.
As well it is known, for lack of some minutes to finish the party (that its team already had clearly cattle), the two players lost deliberately time at the moment of to remove paths lacks for cause that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
Of that way, and since already the Real Madrid will finish as the leader of its group, both players will comply the regulation sanction the next party of the pool, against the Auxerre, and they will be able to pass clean of cards to the following phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two parties to the coach of the team, José Mourinho, and with different economic quantities to the players implied.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances as this or similar is not a new, but more well frequent practice in the world of the soccer.
It is so extended that forms part of the ethos, of the rules done not write, but you followed, of this sport.
It splits of the debate arisen in the case related itself due to that has been starred in for a team of the company of the Real Madrid (that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honor, and that from time to time passed has fined its players by analogous acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to its dilated history of provocative and histrionic technician.
In any case, the debate tour around if that type of behavior done not prohibit explicitly by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport, that is to say, if with these actions you be eaten you fraud of law; therefore, in fact, are respectful actions with the sports regulation, but they seem to elude their sense.
The question passes for examining the type of damage that cause to the sports spirit.
One of the goods that understands the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the contrary players, aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is to say, do not there was I play violent.
Another of these goods to the ones that is alluded with the fair play is to avoid that the team of the players offenders take advantage of unjust way of the contrary team, thing that did neither occur.
Now well, the paradoxical thing of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that itself was not accommodated to what normally we characterize as trap or fraud of law, therefore its violation of the rules was not done to hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but exactly its action tried to be it more evident for thus receive the punishment of the referee.
They expected and they accepted gladly the sanction.
Another question is what type of advantage they obtain the offenders in the deliberate lacks examined.
Here it seems necessary to verify that itself is not placed in unfavorable situation to the rival one neither benefit is obtained in the same party, therefore evidently the result of the action supposes to leave the own team with less players.
And is neither an useful strategy for the next party, therefore the club will not be able to include those players.
The advantage, obviously, consists of that the players will begin the following phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten their participation in a future parted.
But it is a matter of a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, therefore the team can remain eliminated to the first of change, and besides with this action the players comply a party of sanction and they pass to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards is produced with a less than in the first cycle.
So that, to go passing rounds, is not so of course be an advantage.
In final, those actions do not go against the sports spirit, of the one that yes forms part to make strategic decisions that favor to remove the maximum benefit of what permit the rules.
In the supposed one that occupies us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this yes would be a clear case of fraud of law), but more well they chose when to be submitted her.
They made a strategic decision without negotiating the punishment neither to flee the same one.
Although the border between the ingenuity and the fraud of law is diffuse, in this occasion I believe that was a matter of a clear case of ingenuity.
The polemics, seems me, arises for two factors: because was a matter of two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which the broadcast of the guideline to cause them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so much ethical like esthetic.
Offensive of offerings to grasp the Christmas suppers of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the days 16 and 17.
The celebrations proliferate autosufragadas by the employees, that want to spend between 20 and 30 euro.
As the nougat and the lottery, with the arrival of December also they return the prior group suppers to Christmas, that continue exercising of oxygen cylinder for the restoration and the leisure of Barcelona, but that on account of the crisis they have flowed into in an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to grasp the majority client: almost all they want to spend between 20 and 30 euro in suppers or foods, they coincide the Businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To have just complicated the accounting, the calendar of this year (upon falling the new year's Eve in Friday) has concentrated the petitions in the week of December 13, with the result to date of a suppers reserves avalanche for days tip (the 16 and 17) and barely movement for the previous week.
As already it comes happening since the 2008, when began the phase of thin cows, are many businesses that have eliminated the collective suppers by budgetary question.
For dispense not with the tradition, many workers maintain it paying of their own pocket.
Be which be the joint, some and other they require prices of battle, confirms the president of the Gremi of Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the management, to day of today, itself does not dare to predict how will be the feasts of this month.
"The people thinks itself it a lot before reserving."
"It wants to leave but has the on warnings in the theme of the prices," aims.
The business will go well "to the ones that they give quality to good price and with good service," adds, and recalls that the clients tend to descend a step with the crisis, so that the stripe around the 25 euro has become majority in the demand.
In a poll in diverse central establishments the collapse of petitions for the night is verified of the 17.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretension to spend less than 30 euro, to what have responded adapting their menus to the joint, with complete formulae from 25 to 35 euro.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (boarding House of the Rita, Market, The Inn and other), the pecularity of the calendar has involved more advanced booking, even from principles of November.
"We have done the impossible thing to maintain the same prices of last year, with menus for all the inclinations since 19.95 to 30 euro," they detail.
In they GOING Grup, that registers The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and even a total of 23 localities, optimists are maintained after detecting a boom of the billing since the second semester and some good, although concentrated, perspectives of business for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day to friends groups level that precelebran the festivals.
To its six menus of group they have aggregated one Christmas, with the 30 euro or more as budget crashes and the perception that there is predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year in exchange for requiring more details, like digs.
Also they see spring up green in some businesses that invite again its employees and sensation that the volume of the groups is somewhat greater.
On the part of the management one Fecasarm (that includes companies as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), their vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts in beginning see the end of the tunnel and maintains that as a group the reserves are "animated," although the clients "negotiate to the maximum."
That yes, the illusion by the feasts has not descended, pay who pay, indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates great anxiety in US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a faster rhythm than any another country."
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the links between the Talibans and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence among the American embassy in Pakistan and the State Department of US filtered by the entry Wikileaks confirms the enormous anxieties that causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
To the margin of the illuminating and juicy details that offer on the content of the conversations and the thoughts of the diplomatic representatives Americans reputable in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation among both countries in matter of atomic security, instead of being on the rise, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces you arm nuclear "to a faster rhythm than any another country of the world."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not joined but they remain stored by components to complicate its destruction in case of attack -- constitutes one of the main reasons of vigilance in Washington.
Thus the ambassador in Pakistan enumerates it, Anne W. Patterson, in a prior report to the visit of the then National Security Adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to low territory attack Taliban, it been rumored dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transportation of atomic materials."
The high number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and in the programs of missiles is contemplated, not already alone by US, but also by Russia, like proliferante and motive to maintain the guard.
"Pakistan has had that to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect the nuclear installations; given the fall of the cultural and educational levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit to people that work in the nuclear programs or of missiles," the expert one he said Yuri Korolev, of the Department of Russian Outsides, in a meeting with his American counterparts.
It more novel of the documentation filtered by the entry of Julian Assange is the each time smaller cooperation between US and Pakistan in themes of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rhythm of production of nuclear weapons.
An office of the embassy in May, that qualifies as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, maintains: "The transparency is often nonexistent; the offerings of aid remain without answer or they are ruled out."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, verifies that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces you arm nuclear to a faster rhythm than any another country of the world."
The ambassador Patterson also asks to Washington, during a visit of the leader of the Army, the general one Ashfaq Kayani, that leave "very clear" to the head that "the Army of Pakistan to should put an end to the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
To the hunt of the leader of Wikileaks
Obama names to a high one responsible for the antiterrorist fight to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red warning in order to continuing the movements and to locate to Assange where be.
All it related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol emitted an "alerts red" for "to locate and to continue the movements" of Assange.
Nevertheless, does not be a matter of a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, is not new, but dates from November 20.
And does not it have to do with the last filtration of more than one room of million of diplomatic documents of US but with the accusations of sex abuse that the Australian confronts in Sweden.
Besides, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to be put in contact with the Mister Assange."
It was on the 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Lyons (France) dictated the order to request of Sweden, but it did not reveal until yesterday, after receiving authorization of the authorities of that country.
Thus the things, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or to locate to Assange "with a view to their provisional arrest and extradition."
Although the Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many of the member countries, has explained the organization, yes they consider the call network notice clearance to proceed to an arrest --that should attack the national body of police-, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where is believed that is Assange.
The movement has incensed the lawyers of Assange, that yesterday they published a letter denouncing that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has been shown willing to respond for videoconference to the questions of the swedish authorities.
They recall also that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden of the public prosecutor of their case, to which they compare with the mythical one Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, leader of security of Stalin.
"This seems a shooting, not a legal pursuit," accusation the missive.
While the world seeks it -and from Australia its mother defends the innocence of its son -- Assange continues in unknown, but not quiet location.
Monday granted since an indeterminate place an interview to the director of the magazine Swindle through Skype, a conversation in which he asked the resignation of the US State secretary, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that was responsible for ordering American diplomats that spied in the international UN violating treaties that US has signed, should resign," said.
Its opinion was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, that qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the petition of resignation.
"I am not of the every insurance why the opinion of a type with a web page should import us," declared to the chain CNN.
The own Obama has entrusted to a high one responsible for the antiterrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to impede new leaks of documents.
The intent of the spokesman of the president Barack Obama to reduce importance to Assange contrasts with opinions that these days proclaim politicians and conservative commentators.
Peter King, the congressperson that from January will preside the Committee of National Security in the low Camera, has asked to the State Department that study the possibility to include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and its funds and to pursue to any that them of any contribution or helps."

Puigcercós seeks the peace in ERC with winks to the related to Carod
The republican leader will permit to the party a secret ballot on his continuity.
Huguet proposes a plural executive and the end of the system of the assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the prescription to negotiate the umpteenth internal disturbance in the rows of ERC, without north by the loss of 11 representatives and the half of the votes.
The president of the party is conscious that its I threaten of resignation turns out to be insufficient for the related to the exlíder Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but also knows that the influence of that sector is today so diluted as its own mentor and that at all can cause him the headaches of head that had with other extinct currents.
Because of it, the leader of Esquerra will try to be won the new critics with winks that permit him to be armor-plated to the municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national counselors of ERC will be able to be pronounced on their continuity in secret.
By means of ballots, and not by hand raised.
If the carodistas want traffic certain protest vote to the president, they will be able to do it without fear to retaliations.
In fact, the party leader wants to avoid the image of so much division as that of subjugation to his person.
In several interviews, affirmed that itself would not be considered ratified with the half more one of the votes, but added, without needing percentages, that would neither be good a result "to the Bulgarian."
The next to Carod require the president something more than putting its charge at the disposal of the membership, a gesture that does not be worth when Puigcercós controls the maximum organ among congresses.
But upon not having the sufficient majority to force resignations, they are going to try to agree with the executive a waybill from here to May.
For it, they expect to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will submit to voting of the national counsel on the 18.
Its intention is to vouch for to Puigcercós in exchange that this promise to advance the congress to autumn of the 2011, something that the dome already gives for fact.
The leader of ERC recognized that the "polyphony" damages the stability and that its objective is to do that, immediately for all, the organization be capable to wash the dirty cloths of doors toward inside.
In this line, the article turns out to be symptomatic that the secretary in functions Josep Huguet signed in its blog.
They considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació gave for fact that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for diverse objectives."
And it enumerated five, of the ones that they emphasize two.
The first one, "to recompose" the executive so that dam you at least to the 90% of the membership, that is to say, to include new faces that stem from the related sector to Carod.
The second can be the great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate immediately the asambleísmo as mechanism of operation.
Thus, it supports a reform of the statutes that permit to celebrate the congresses through chosen delegates by vote.
Put an end to the model of the assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, that already battled in this sense in the two last congresses.
In fact, the convulsed conference of the 2008 left the assignment to the direction to revise the asambleísmo in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment continues slope, therefore the internal tide of recent years dissuaded to confront the matter.
Now, without critical sectors to the spying, can be a good moment to take up again and to try to close it for always.

Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts coincide that the Dream Act faces the greater obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put the finger in the sore
The second patrols of The pleasures of the tongue was a walk where the participants did gala of the narration
"That of The sex in the tongue I understand it but... The finger in the sore? What expects of me?," inquired the author Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of The pleasures of the tongue, cycle that celebrates to the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of its question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to The sex in the tongue, explained).
The finger in the sore... "It puts us in predicaments," skewered sweetly the author Argentina to the public, mainly of youths, that appointment in the International Fair of the Book was given of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where they participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Hunter and Luis Garcia Hunter.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define later as a great story, with Luisa in the first person like the protagonist that in search of the to know which is the "sore," he goes of doctor in doctor, of the ones that does not he obtain answers although yes trails in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectólogo leaves convinced: "The patience is not my fort, perhaps be my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist that the breath in half of the walkway has stolen him, but who clarifies him that sore is not a scientific term; is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "The sore is open the real thing, the symbolic thing is the scar."
The protagonist sighed alleviated and he concluded "of the sore only I managed to know that is open the real thing and that does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and the traps of the tongue should go very mixed.
Valenzuela, the author, he played with both.
The Nicaraguan one Sergio Ramírez also exposed a delightful narration that regular Compliment of the invention, where the finger in the sore is not named but in a moment is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, account of a famous magical one, that the same thing touched clouds, brought of return to men that had gone far away or repaired the virtues that to have lost a maiden, narration that veered to speak then America, the great novel to which him did not they lack since the principle its own columnists that counted it and cited to Bernal Díaz of the Castle who criticizes the excesses of It they counted by the conquering captains.
"Cervantes that invented us to all (the writers) did mockery of the pretended witnesses that appeared in the histories presented as real, but of another way never itself to have come to count the history of America with imagination to which lacked him to the modesty."
Nevertheless, it emphasized "are the lunatics and the liars the ones that better imagine" and is where converges reality and lie, where no longer is known that of it related belongs to an edict or to another, where the literature of fiction reaches its height.
It calls it in fact the "tradition of cervantes '.
"By inheritance its we are what is counted."

The Cuban-puerto rican one aimed his toward the great sore of the social violence that crosses its country -and shares Latin America- product of the disputes of the traffic and sale of drugs.

It considered that in a world that lives to hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciences that impacts in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind each affirmation there is a small one not and behind each negation there is a small one yes."
"To be owners of our thought and to be owners of the reality we have to qualify: and to qualify signifies many times to put the finger in the sore and to bother those people that are a lot more comfortable thinking about caricature, blank and black, in ideas established and without shade and to bother also to the powers that prefer a black and blank world," he said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for its first title
Rubén Omar Roman counts on three routs in ends, has had ups and downs in its career, but has known to reach already in three occasions the decisive series.

Rubén Omar Roman counts on three routs in ends, has had ups and downs in its career, but has known to reach already in three occasions the decisive series, although up to now has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has finished being consoled with the medal of the runner-up, he has remained a step behind of the winners and curiously with a same team he has played consecutive ends.
The strategist santista arrived at its first end as the coach in the Tournament Opening 2002, when carried the reins of the Morelia with which fell for global of 4-2 before Toluca; subsequently, in the Closure 2003 also arrived at the decisive sorrow and also lost it with global of 3-1 and was exactly before Bordered.
Already with Holy Gap, in the Bicentenary Tournament 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén suffer again a setback, since its team finished drawn 2-2 before the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the show of pénaltis was put in advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three its players failed since the 11 steps and suffered the somersault 4-3.
Rubén already lost two ends with the Red Devils and a with Monterrey, its rival one in shift, therefore does not want to run the same luck, search to be removed of the curse and to be able to celebrate for first occasion a title, although affirms that for him it more important is the institution.
"I want to leave champion, I do not want to break none statistical, this is for a club, by a fondness to which I owe me and by consequence the title will come for my, but the previous thing is it more important," commented the helmsman when was questioned it about the numbers that has against playing ends.
Very in force has the previous end, of which, assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching that can have is that until the referee whistle the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penal by throwing already we were prepared to leave running and I believe that that is a teaching, until not the party be finished we can celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that him not restless, therefore trusts in its players: "One never it seeks to arrive at the show of penal, one search to finish in regular time, but at times there is not of another and one must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately an evil move did us the destiny, at times by the nerves or the anxiety to have the title in the hands, but was itself us, that left us something for this end that we expect arrive not To that instance."
Roman has in their hands to stop being a technical runner-up and to test for the first time the glory that give the titles.

It will announce NASA find of extraterrestrial life
The American spatial agency cited to the press to present tomorrow a find that will cause impact in the search of living beings in the space.

Upon citing to the press, the NASA assured that will present "a find that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life," what stirred up speculations of experts of other countries.
The discovery would be able to show the theory that at par our creatures exist and in hostile environments that thought uninhabitable, and they would put on the table the possibility of that they become beings intelligent as the humans if improve the conditions in which they live.
Apparently it is a matter of a microbe that was found in the fund of the Cute one Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, where lives in an environment that thought too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Of some way, the creature utilizes the arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity he enlarges the possibility that similar life could exist in other planets, that do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiólogos, if these agencies utilize the arsenic in his metabolism, will remain shown that "yes there is another form of life, a life form second, different to which we know."
The spatial agency will bring to light the true reach of the finds in the Thursday tomorrow press conference.
In the conference will participate the geobióloga Even Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists that study Titan (the greater moon of Saturn), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Land.

"The politicians do not know what is to close a day a business and do not they have idea of the fortune that is lost, or otherwise did not do in this way the works in the meantime time and without the duty planning."
The hotel one José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the City Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and to avoid that even again, how to do it therefore giving preventive maintenance and not to fall only in the corrective thing," expressed.
"We are desirous to enjoy a clean city, because not only by being tourist area should be given the maintenance, but as the inhabitants that deserve a clean place to live and the City Hall should change its strategy for maintain well to the city."
There are other places that also light up careless and incomplete, he said, like the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Nowadays, so that come the tourist does not depend only of the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that have cleaning in his beaches, in his avenues, permanent maintenance in which are the tourist attractions," he said.
"Not the attention has been given owed and this type in fact puts in evidence something that is notorious for all, the maintenance does lack."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourist Promotion, expressed that is urgent the rescue of tourist places of Mazatlán, therefore they are not taken advantage of correct way and they project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put in line as a group with the municipality and to be priority to have the city to the day, clean, ordinate and that be attraction because is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many places and cultural and historic places that there will be that to order first, to clean and to put us in line to do them attractions to be able to add in the inventory that we have to promote to the destiny."
It asks IP results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, proposed that the representatives assume the great responsibility to be an example to see for a better one Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that faces.
A Legislature of free and worthy work in agreement between parties and of the state Executive demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a Sinaloa convulsed that faces large problematic.
Since yesterday it remained installed the 60 legislature, comprising seven political forces, 19 representatives of the PRI, 13 of the BREAD, three of the Party New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more than the PVEM, that adds a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the listing of expectations of the new members of the Congress of the State is that they come to carry out a clean management and of commitment with the company and with the different sectors that require of a responsible legislative work and that themselves not the same bosses of the partisanship be repeated or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Business Coordinating Counsel, proposed that the recently premiered 40 representatives of the Congress of the State assume the great responsibility to be an example to see for a better one Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that faces.
"We expect that the representatives really exercise their right, free in agreement among the parties because is custom that do arrangements to watch for the own interests and they become extras carnival of the rulers and of the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
For that reason he spoke that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that remove ahead the Ruler in shift.
"We occupy that they come to do a worthy work and above all compromised with the company and with the sectors because were the sinaloenses who gave them the vote of confidence in them you passed elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Three Islands, considered that one of the large challenges of the 40 popular representatives is that of pushing and to add forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated.
"It more important it is that they push the economic growth, that generate incentives for the investment and infrastructure and that of some way will promote the generation of jobs."
As for the tourist activity, demanded that the new legislators give the weight that covers inside the state budget to fortify the Secretary of state Tourism.
"I have understood that is the second Office of the secretary in the state with smaller budget and is incongruent like important economic activity and generator of currencies and investment and that of direct form competes with the farming industry."
Besides that is required labeled resources to explosive tourist projects and that contribute in giving him security to the state and in the updating to the Law of Alcohols that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.

Fourteen presumed detained drug dealers

They have been people under arrest fourteen people that will be faced to diverse accusations.
The pursuits have been produced in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, chiefly in the places where the production of the drug was carried out.

The people under arrest had to appear in the law courts of Sherbrooke in the following hours to their detention.
They would be able to be faced to the Cannabis production accusations, possession for the purpose of traficar, conspiracy and robbery of services, among others.
These pursuits have been produced after a long investigation that has lasted near a year.
"It has been the information supplied by the public the one that has permitted us to carry out the detentions," I need the Mister Ruel.
In this police operation they participated around seventy agents of the module of investigation to Striate of the Security of the Quebec, of the Service of police of Sherbrooke and of the Department of police Memphrémagog.
Will be able to be fought against the secret migration without problems
The government bill of the conservatives that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the loaded small boats of migrant secret, surely will be faced to a great opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesday that could not support it.
"I base me chiefly in the Letter."
"I find me here with a party that has created the granite that you step," declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the representatives after the celebration of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The liberals defend that the government bill in its current form, that would permit to stop to a year to any person that proceed of an identifying ship as transportation of secret immigrants, infringes the Canadian Letter of rights and liberties.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, indicated likewise that would not be able to support the government bill because aims at the white wrong one.
"We are against and, as seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so already we will see what does the Government," declared the Mister Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in matter of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected of a stroke of the pen the criticisms that indicate that its party is not it sufficiently sign with the secret immigrants.
"The neodemócratas agree that measures be adopted against the responsible for the small boats of secret and that is what we intend with another government bill, the C-35," indicates the lady Chow.
"Do not we support the government bill of the conservatives because attacks the refugees and imprisons the children during a minimum of a year," explains the lady Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused to the parties of the position to play politicians and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The great majority of the Canadians tells the representatives that do not tolerate this type of secret migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that treat to the country as if was a doormat."
"They expect that Canada adopt some firm measures," the Minister thinks Kenney.
The Government has not announced a voting of confidence on its government bill, what would be able to carry to the country to some elections as a result of its refusal.
Nevertheless, a conservative has communicated to the Agency QMI that the Government was going to request the celebration of a voting so that each representative that be going to oppose be explained later before its voters.
The new unit does not obtain the unanimity
In spite of the fact that the possible creation of a permanent unit of fight against the corruption had been announced and the collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue asking the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the question.
The Minister of the public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been presented two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of new York is last year from January question.
The metropolises possesses a permanent unit against the corruption since 1870.
Consequently, the announcement on Tuesday has caught for surprise at more than one.
It fits to say that, during a meeting of the permanent Counsel on the police services of Quebec celebrated last October 29, never debated this measure in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was sufficient so that the critic of the party quebequense that treats the question of the public security, Stéphane Bergeron, he qualified this announcement as "a rabbit removed of the top hat" and like "a latest sloppy solution."
The Minister Dutil, in turn, has responded to whom they are afraid that the political power have too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You will see the results when we announce it," indicates simply.
"We are conscious of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can substitute the launch of a public survey.
"The more it persists the Mister Charest in avoiding the creation of this commission of investigation, more people shares our opinion, that is to say, that has something that to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a commission of investigation is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and gobernanza of the national School of public administration.
To leave the break-even point, suggests to Quebec that grant a special mandate to the general administrator so that carry out a survey on the collusion and the corruption.
"We should be capable of expanding the mandate of the general administrator," concludes.
Likewise, it considers that Quebec would be able to offer the administrator the same competences that to a commissioner, permitting him thus to oblige the people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in you sift in the Government Charest.
Quebec requests likewise to Ottawa that modify the penal Code so that adapt better to this type of crime.
This request seems to proceed of the public prosecutor of the operation Marteau, that has informed the Attorney general Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of investigations.
The federal Minister of the public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed in turn that its counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, inclines at present by carrying out certain amendments in relation to this theme.
During the operation Spring 2001 related to the groups of bikers, although itself had not adapted the penal Code, were people under arrest 131 people.
Subsequently, Ottawa prompted the adoption of the Law on the gangsterism.

The north rivers, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and of the Chêne, in Lotbinière, already have caused floods in the past and they are under guard.
In the region of Lanaudière, the strong haste have caused that overflowed some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-of-Kildare and in Rawdon.

They blame partly to Dupont
The presenter of radio of Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reverse before the Canadian Counsel of the norms of the radiotelevisión (CCNR) for some controversial statements in relation to the social assistance and on the Haitians, as well as by its gross language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that the Mister Dupont and their team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but you determined statements contained "inexact information on the social assistance, a representation unduly refusal of the Haitians and gross language that should not be utilized in the emissions diffused during the day."
The Counsel has indicated likewise that the debates on the suicide, including the disclosure of the name of two people that had killed themselves, they do not infringe the codes on the broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints in relation to the done comments in emissions diffused between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was emitted after a complaint of the common Front of people that receive social assistance of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presenters should communicate reliable data and that they conduct not to deceit.
In relation to the suicide, the presented Stéphane Dupont had declared that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Committee they have come to the conclusion that the message transmitted was that should not be considered the suicide as a solution to the problems of the life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes positions in prohibition of" Dupont him midi" have tried a delicate theme of an adequate and fair way."
Consequently, to this respect any fault has been rejected.
The last lawsuit referred to the statements carried out after the earthquake of Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media clash that stirred up numerous reactions.
The presenter of CHOI declared that he had not carried out any donation to help the Haitians because he could not know with security if them you needed they were going to receive really the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that its cumulative effect constitutes a representation unduly refusal of the Haitians.
"Already I have completed my suspension of three days up there."
"My expedient is clean since a year and a half ago," declared the presenter.
In all the decisions, the Committee denounces the emission of gross language.
In any case, the chain of radio CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than it required."
The consequences will be lows for the radio station, that will owe, among others things, to announce the decisions once in the prime time within three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The montrealés of algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had a traveled through extremely peculiar.
The athlete, that emphasizes in "sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), kickboxing and and thai pit, rises to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began to practice martial arts as the kung fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria," explained Zemmal, that lives in the metropolises since 2008 to advance in the professional level.
"In my case, I seek battles everywhere because, for who do not they enjoy with the play on the floor that imply the mixed martial arts, few competitions in North America exist."
The athlete, that works as a security agent and as the employee of the business UPS, has given recently bad news to its rival, winning two medals of gold in the Championship of the World amateur of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), celebrated from the 23 to October 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have earned in the categories of kickboxing full contact and of thai pit," explained.
"At present I prepare me to participate in the World Cup of San shou in China."
"They will invite the sportsmen that have finished among the four first positions in the last championship of the world in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finalized the tournament in fifth position, but I reached the third position in Toronto in 2009," added.
"The interesting thing is that I have gone progressing in each competition."
"At this rate, ¡I will be the first one this time or next year!"
The "San shou" or "sanda" is a native discipline of China in which is permitted to strike with the fists and the feet, as well as to launch the adversaries to the floor.
The clashes originally are celebrated on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of battle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Him, extensively recognized in the world of the martial arts.
Although to Be born Zemmal so alone should maintain a competition in its career, without doubt will respond to the great tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious one of China," explains the nice boy.
"Is like the equivalent one to the stadium Lumpinee (the major stadium of Thailand) ."
"Has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal has earned its first battle, in the semifinals of its category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"The one that has earned is me a true professional," he thinks.
"There are four competitors by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals are faced in the end of their category."
"Subsequently, the champions of each category are faced to crown to an only champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has granted direct contracts by a value of 450 million dollars to businesses of engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts a consortium formed by the businesses is found BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, that has obtained without a subject to the contract more important tender, that of management of the project, by a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, call Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 because of the decision of Hydro-Quebec to trust to the private sector its responsibility to negotiate this important hydroelectric project of 5,000 million dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium Énergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without was carried out previously a public tender.
For the Party quebequense, the resource to strike businesses consortiums a serious ethical problem that threatens with eliminating the competence and to cause an ascent of the prices.
"It is a matter of a new method of collusion and to eliminate the competence."
"That is to say, the people, instead of doing it in secret, now they do it openly," declared yesterday the representative of the Party quebequense Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, the Mister Simard presented the question in the national Assembly because, as affirms, does not understand how the public interest of this way can be benefited.
The Minister of natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, denying firmly that have itself produced a collusion with this contract.
"I begin to tire me," protested, defending that the PQ had acted of way "dishonest" and "with lack of severity."
It indicated that "the most minimum thing" would be that the PQ excused itself.
The formula of the consortiums is a common practice in the entire world.
Normally, it is a matter of an alliance with a temporary limit that permits to two or several businesses to group its know-how to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The project Eastmain presents a high level of complexity, keeping in mind the magnitude of the works.
The works already have begun and they will last until 2012.
In all the case, the contract has been granted without came into play the competence; itself tried a negotiation.
Besides, the formula of the consortiums has left to be the exception to the norm in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
Just as it published last week Him Devoir, the formula of the consortiums in the sector of the technical advice is being submitted to an investigation in the Government.
A fast look to the business register of Quebec permits to identify more than 200 consortiums, of which some they seem permanent.
In this way, the business Dessau works in association with the majority of its main competitors, like TOP +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche or Tecsult, and other.
Each combination, and they exist scores of they, conducts to an only legal entity, that is to say, Dessau.
As for the consortium Énergie gérance, the Minister Normandeau has noticeable that "the territory of the Bay James responds to a dynamics of private labor and Hydro-Quebec responds specifically her since the years 1970."
The great leader of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d' énergie of the Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has noticeable the fact that the contract of management of the project has been granted of direct form.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices are going to be higher."
"You have two options: can enter contact with the actors of the sector and to tell them: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"Nevertheless, the idea is that what imports is not the price, but the competence of the people," indicated the Mister Laporte.
The contract granted to the consortium Énergie gérance forms part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars obtained by the Party quebequense.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ for the project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After the verification, Him Devoir has identifying 109 contracts of technical advice granted between the year 2002 and March from 2010 to businesses or to its subsidiaries, particularly ground laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without keep in mind its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were bureaus.
On the whole, they elevate to 449.783.344 dollars, included the contract of Énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has given understand that the four businesses that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) they are "good acquaintances of the liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau has left to fall that the PQ also is linked to these companies, that it "they finance," before needing that rather, it is a matter of its leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer quebequense barely trusts in the actors of the sustainable development, as well as in the marks of just commerce neither in the ecological certificates to guide his elections.
According to the Barometer of the consumption responsible, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is still worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe by where swarm messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that this even brakes its commitment.
Even if it has enlarged the consumption of the called products "socially responsible" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to give very little credit to whom they try to sell them.
Two thirds of them tell, in fact, that they do not trust in the environmental commitment of the businesses neither in the publicity ecologists of the same, reveals the tool of measurement elaborated by the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: the half of the consumers puts in doubt the reliability of the official certificates that carry the just called products, as well as the credibility of the products and marks that carry labels indicating that they are "ecorresponsables," indicates the Barometer.
In the same way, only a 14.6% of the quebequenses they are taken in serious the speeches of the politicians on this question.
In every case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of the consumption, supported at present by near a third of the consumers quebequenses.
In fact, the gaps and the doubtful character of the information do that a 46% of the consumers reject this option.
Is a matter of the second identifying obstacle by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Besides, a third of the quebequenses they say to distrust also of the supposed performances of the products or ecological services that tries him himself to sell.
On the other hand, practically the half of the consumers they changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, they changed the mark of one or various products to respect their convictions.
A 61% it has given priority to the purchases in the stores of its neighborhood and has preferred to buy eating products cultivated in its region, indicates the Barometer.
Greener and responsible (the index of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum of a hundred this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec worships to occupy the position of the king of the recycling that tries to reduce its impact on the environment worrying about the protection of the fauna.
Nevertheless, according to the Barometer, that social conscience seems to be of doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, so alone the 28% of the quebequenses indicated that have utilized the public transportation or they have shared car to defend their principles ecologists.
Besides, the 39.1% of the participants of this extensive survey of behavior, that has just completed its first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and the displacements on foot.
A loan so that the State recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, to which they have asked that compromise financially in the recovery of the complex of movies eXcentris pursuit the Société Angus and the Parallèle, accepts to collaborate, but only by means of a loan.
The Société of développement Angus and the Parallèle, that expected a donation of seven million dollars of the Department of Culture to buy again to Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris in the boulevard Saint-Laurent and to return him their true vocation movie fan, they have not obtained what asked.
The Government has accepted to be implied in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the donation expected, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be, in fact, lower to the initial expectations; this would be able to constitute a viable solution in profitable conditions, at least in opinion of you determined civil servants.
Quebec already had rejected it passed spring a first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the requests have been revised downward.
The president of the Société of développement give entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, that heads the expedient of eXcentris, remitted a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St-Pierre.
A last report has sent him does about ten days.
Nevertheless, the SODEC received a counterproposal of the cabinet Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have of time limit to December 31 to respond to the same one.
In every case, seems that should be rejected completely the hypothesis of a donation of the State.
We recall that the movie theaters owners Association and film complexes of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Department of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since has not done it with other movie theaters.
On the other hand, diverse representatives of the sector yes demand a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the same one, has carried for ten years the load of the movies of author in its localities of the complex, after financing its own construction, what would be able to justify a revocation on the part of the Counsel of the Treasure.
The lack of rooms for independent movies results patent in Montreal and eXcentris had known fidelizar to its clientele.
The business Angus and the Parallèle, directed by Christian Yaccarini, they prompt in turn a campaign of financing in private, expecting to meet 700,000 dollars to break through toward the acquisition.
From spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, continues projecting movies in eXcentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms the next one 27 of February, projecting the precious movie of Xavier Beauvois "Give hommes or give dieux."
Nevertheless, Christian Yaccarini has not to be put again in contact with Him Devoir and do not we know what think he and their group of the proposals downward that they have received.
The veil of Canada raises itself neurotic...
The new American diplomatic cables divulged by WikiLeaks are watchful what the United States consider as the complex of the Canadians with regard to the Americans, but they reflect at the same time the feeling of superiority of these last toward Canada.
The American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian voters think not about the relations Canada-United States when are going to vote and they believe that the visit of the president Obama has helped the conservative government to obtain that was approved its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American embassy of Ottawa and of Washington that have done themselves public yesterday, they offer well juicier details than contained really substantial.
A cable of September 22, 2008, that is to say, during full federal electoral campaign, relates up to what point the United States do not enter the questions debated by the political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the ambassador American envoy to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
The Mister Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps the political leaders are seen conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent in the Canadians at the moment of to treat the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving such election to the United States (as during the campaign on the free commerce of 1988) ," he writes.
Consequently, it concludes, the United States are "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to speak of him."
The ambassador has still more problems in understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain some intense economic and political relations.
"Logically, it thinks, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and, still more, of the leader of a party to negotiate these essential relations should be a key factor in which they should think the voters at the moment of to vote."
This feeling of importance can be observed also the sent cable January 22, 2009 by Terry be Abused, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare the president Barack Obama for its first visit to Ottawa.
"Its trip will contribute to guarantee the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by means of which Canada will register for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a plan of recovery from among 30,000 and 40,000 million dollars," writes the Mister be Abused.
In no side mention is done that the government had to defer the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that him to substitute the coalition neither that the opposition parties conditioned their survival to the quality of the plan of recovery proposed.
Another communication of January of 2008 signed by the ambassador Wilkins alerts to Washington on the image increasingly more negative than transmit the series dramatics diffused in the CBC U.S.
To the ambassador worries the emission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which subtle little references are carried out to Maher to Till, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the abductions so that the CIA carry out energetic interrogations.
Another cable counts that, during its first bilateral encounter, Hillary Clinton asked its French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to receive some prisoners of Guantánamo.
The Mister Kouchner responded so but that depended "of each case."
In the end of the meeting, they wrote "has delivered a document to the Secretary of State in relation to Omar Khadr, a Moslem of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary accepted to revise the expedient."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits in relation to the place have been heated WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, old counselor very close to Stephen Harper, declared in the radio of CBC that the responsible for this massive leak should be "murdered."
In the United States they are echoed of Mike Huckabee.
A world plan to renew the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan of renewal of the commercial, domestic lighting and industrialist in a hundred countries to reduce the greenhouse gases (GEI) in a quantity that corresponds practically to a third of the additional decrease that should be carries out for stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is framed in the assembly of large concrete projects that the UN expects that be adopted in Cancun to compensate the lack of binding commitments of reduction in the countries industrialized.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent lightbulbs, that still monopolize between the 50 and the 70% of the market, be to substituted for lightbulbs fluocompactas or, still better, by lightbulbs of diodes electroluminescentes (OF THE or "LED" in English), great part of the 1,800 million tons would be avoided (Gt) of GEI they emitted in the planet to illuminate the humans.
The lighting is responsible for the 8% of the world emissions.
Is the equivalent one to the 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet.
In Copenhagen, last year, the large countries transmitters, as the United States, Chinese, Europe and other, included Canada, they compromised with some plans of voluntary reduction that should diminish the global emissions of GEI of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
Nevertheless, they should be diminished still 5 Gt of said quantity to stabilize, before 2020, the increase of the temperatures in two degrees centigrade for avoid that themselves descontrole.
In the incandescent lightbulbs, the 95% of the energy is dissipated in the shape of heat and the remainder, that is to say, a 5%, produces light.
In the case of the lightbulbs fluocompactas, the expense of energy is reduced in a 75% and with the new lightbulbs LED, is reduced still two times more the energy consumption.
The lightbulbs fluocompactas last an average from among 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new lightbulbs LED, like the ones that has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a business that, besides, has participated in the study of the UN), they possess a hope of life of 25,000 hours and they consume a 80% less than energy that an incandescent lightbulb, what permits us to get an idea of the savings that can be obtained with the plan of replacement that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new lightbulbs can also function with rheostats and they emit very little heat.
Over, they do not contain anything of mercury.
Diverse specialists have declared their reserves in relation to the lightbulbs fluocompactas, since they contain mercury and that should be eliminated as dangerous residues, which always is not possible in the developing countries, unless the manufacturers place instructions.
Nevertheless, it indicates the report, the main mercury emission source in the planet are not the lightbulbs fluocompactas, but the power stations of coal, that emit a large quantity of mercury to produce the electricity that is wasted with the incandescent lightbulbs.
Only in the United States, central happinesses emit 25,000 tons of mercury to the year.
The report details the advantages that would offer this international program to each country.
For example, Indonesian would be saved in this way thousand million dollars to the year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is to say, the equivalent one to 3.5 power stations whose construction would cost him 2,500 million.
Ivory Coast expects anxiously the announcement of the electoral results
The Secretary general of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the publication "immediate" of the results of the presidential elections in Ivory Coast, given that have expired the time limit set.
"The Secretary general emphasizes the need that the independent electoral commission complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," stands out a spokesman of the leader of the UN.
"It asks to all the parties of Ivory Coast and to the institutions that show their sense of the responsibility and they abstain of any initiative until the provisional results be announced."
In spite of the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left that even the date limit on Wednesday at midnight without the results were published, three days since the scrutiny on Sunday.
Around forty minutes before the finalización of the time limit, the president of the CIS had commented to the television that the commission "continued working" to announce the results.
Wednesday they have multiplied in the world the petitions that the CIS proclaim finally the name of the winner of the second return between the departing one Laurent Gbagbo and its opposing one Alassane Ouattara.
Nevertheless, the edict of Gbagbo counts on the annulment on the part of the constitutional Counsel of the votes "fraudulent" in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the new Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'etat of September of 2002.
Pascal Affi N' Guessan, director of the campaign of the president of Ivory Coast, has affirmed that the maneuvers of intimidation of the voters carried out by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the followers of the outgoing president to be going to vote.
All the election would be able to remain annulled if the constitutional Counsel accepts the complaints presented by Gbagbo.
Now well, the adversaries of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neuter, since is directed by Paul Yao N' Dré, a nearby political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a north man that contradicts any relation with the old rebels, has judged of "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results and has asked to Gbagbo that respect them, but has not gone so far away as to claim the victory.
Its allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because knows that has lost and that to present a complaint before the constitutional Counsel after to have impeded that the electoral commission the diffusion of the results, would be illegal.
The second return of the presidential, Sunday, should have placed the cherry to the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country divided into two since years ago.
The United Nations have notified Wednesday to the political establishment of Ivory Coast that could be you considered responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first return, October 31, with the 38% of the votes set against the 32% of Alassane Ouattara, that received publicly the support of the old president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first return).

Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, continues doing it and has announced Tuesday a rate of the 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October, after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guérini, of 53 years, residues processing businesses executive and brother of the president PS of the general Counsel of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-in-Provence, in the framework of an investigation on supposedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, embezzlement and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, traffic of influences and possession of munition, as indicates its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will respond to all the questions that I plant him the judge, not ghosts."
"It turns out to be easy to pursue him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, another thing is to show them," had declared to the AFP its lawyer, Florence Rault, before the court appearance of its client.
The Mister Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, has wanted to transmit its lawyers to the judge, before its court appearance, a document to be explained.
Wednesday night they began to investigate and they imprisoned likewise to one of their nearby people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to its lawyer, the Mister Lucien Simon, the unique thing that has done its client has been to be in charge of the dumps that should negotiate.
As for the allocation of the contracts or to the destiny of the funds related to its execution, does not know anything on the matter, the learned one as says Simon.
In the framework of this expedient, is being investigated likewise from Wednesday Daniel Pinna, former general director of the services of the urban conglomeration of Aubagne, by embezzlement and complicity, but they have left him in probation and has prohibited to be met with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."

Michel Karabadjakian, assistant general manager of the property of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), has been accused by "traffic of influences and passive corruption."
Two officials of the conglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, they have been interrogated for "subtraction and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to the public utility" and by "complicity in the public embezzlement," respectively.
Finally, the companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for "cover-up of the abuse of social goods."
Among the people that have been faced the Mister Guérini figures Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, imprisoned recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts that they affected to Corsica.
The investigators suspect that its companies there are service to whiten the capital of the great banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April from 2009 after the reception of some anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, particularly in the sector of the residues.
A source close to the investigation indicates that the investigations concentrate especially in the conditions of allocation and operation of a dump in The Ciotat, that collects the waste of Aubagne, as well as of other cities of the urban community of Marseilles (MPM).
Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Eliseo has exagerrateded the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, between July of 2009 and May of 2010, the destiny of Clotilde Reiss, the young woman detained French researcher in Iran by "espionage," has had in suspense to the public in France, has alerted to the diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attentive look of the diplomats U.S.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Him Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Eliseo has explained its strategy to the Americans to the extent of giving them counsels to negotiate its own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French heads tried to convince to Washington that the liberation of French the young woman was not produced in exchange by the liberation of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought by the American justice by trade of materials for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate to the mass media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had performed an essential function in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, did not do anything.
A diplomatic telegram edited August 12, 2009 in Paris carries the title "Iran: French comments on the way to negotiate the cases of takes of hostages."
The counselor of the Eliseo for strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d' Offside for the north of Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, they converse with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain him the French method.
They advise the Americans that do the following thing to repatriate their own citizens retained by force in Iran.
"You do noise," they say, "free continuously" in the mass media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation."
All to shame the careful, Iranian state of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you that even, you do it more often still."
Because, once they exhausted the intents of negotiation by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," the Iranians are "expert in maneuvers delays."
The Mister Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a habitual Iranian tactic: takes it of hostages for the political blackmail."
It announces that the liberation of prison of Clotilde Reiss (that will be produced August 16, day in which take refuge in the embassy of France) "will require the guarantee to the Iranians of a large quantity of money" (230,000 euro of reward).
Besides, it indicates that the Eliseo anticipates other crisis of hostages, a phenomenon that "is going to enlarge."
The Iranians would be able "in a next future to stop to another of the near 1,800 French citizens that live in Iran," affirms.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
The following information is diffused: the Iranian one Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request the United States by illicit traffic of delicate electronic material toward Iran, has been position at liberty in Paris by decision of a judge.
The American, just like numerous embassy observers, they doubt of this strange coincidence.
For Washington, that fence the secret networks Iranians of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand constitutes a bad news.
It has accepted France an exchange?
Freeing the Iranian in exchange for the Frenchwoman?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4, François Richier guarantees that was not thus.
The Eliseo, affirms, not alone "has been surprised enormously by the decision of the judge," but has tried to be opposed to the same one.
"There has been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Attorney general" (in the epoch, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision" judicial, comments.
The Mister Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand continues under the "narrow" caution of the services of French information.
The counselor of the Eliseo marks a phone number, cluster and, later, he informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is found at present in some buildings of Paris negotiated by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Eliseo does not spare in efforts, utilizes communiqués and "leaks" organized in the mass media to cause to believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a role "important" and "influential" of "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity with certain irony and they verify that the handling brings their fruits, since various articles of press transmit the French official version.
A telegram on the August 25, 2009 mentions "the 'blitz' media of the French officials."
Why such it is owed "gratitude" toward the Mister Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"In spite of their full statements of praises, the French officials recognize in private that so alone they have a vague idea of what have done really the Syrians."
Subsequently, the document treats the reasons that have carried to the Eliseo to lead to this fiction.
The great effort of communication "considers object to validate the politics of Sarkozy of opening toward Syria," thinks.
A politics initiated in 2008, that "in opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just to be erased of premature and desmerecida."
To the "to exaggerate the Syrian role," Paris tries "to show to Syria the compliments that can harvest if plays a constructive role in the region."
The objective also consists of "to sow the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows it about good source.
August 11, François Richier trusts him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done something or not."
"But at any rate, we have thanked itself it."
"At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Eliseo.
In a communiqué, thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius that have performed an "active role in favor of the liberation of our countryman."
From midnight, the Korean youths cannot play in line
The south korean Government is going to adopt a called law "of Ashen" that will impede the adolescents to participate in play in line after the average night blocking their access, they have indicated governmental heads.
In December a government bill to the Parliament will be submitted to ask to the businesses of play in line that block the access to you said play after midnight to the youths of less than 16 years, have indicated representatives of the Departments of Culture and of Family.
"Many children play all the night and, later, turns out to be difficult them to study in the school and to carry a normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect its health and its right to the dream," declared the AFP Jo Rhine, ministerial head responsible for the government bill.
The play in line will be again available at six in the morning.
The businesses will have a year to be prepared for the law enforcement, I need.
The government be planted likewise to ask to the businesses that limit the daily access time to these play when the parents of the youths thus request it, added the head.
Besides, it is going to put at the disposal of who request you program it data processing free that permit to limit the time of Internet connection.
South Korea is one of the countries more "connected" and the newspapers give news regularly on diverse facts linked to an intensive use of Internet.
The country is likewise the indisputable champion of the world competitions of play in line.
In November, South Korea obtained four medals of gold in the World Cyber Games, where was faced to other 58 countries.
World 2018-2022: the FIFA appoints to the countries organizers
In the middle of the storm caused by them you suspect of corruption, the executive board of the FIFA appoints Thursday to the countries organizers of the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, an election clearly politics where the fights of influence and the lobbying can come they predominate on the technical criteria.
A thing is clear, the edition from 2018 of the competition of the FIFA will be celebrated in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition of 2022 will be a lot more exotic, given that the International Confederacy expects to conquer new territories (Katar, Australia), after a premiere in the African continent in 2010, or to continue with its establishment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that formed part of the delegations (David Cameron, the prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Katar, the leaders of Dutch and Belgian Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the political and economic interests that are in play in a World one.
The transactions among frames, therefore, is possible that last to the last minute.
Otherwise, it turns out to be difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the report of evaluation of the FIFA, the Hispanic-Portuguese, English candidacies (2018) and American (2022) they possess better arguments than their competitors.
Nevertheless, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive board at the moment of to vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that conducted to the suspension by corruption of two members of the CE (Reynald Temarii and Masters Adamu), would be able to have ruined thus the opportunities of its country, cradle of the soccer, that only received the World one once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the blaze Monday upon diffusing a documentary one that has placed in evidence to three influential members of the CE, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to displease to the FIFA and to shame the English heads, that have been launched to a lobbying intense in the last few weeks with David Cameron to the head.
The Leader of Government expects to reprint the blow hit upon success by his predecessor, Tony Blair, that had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012.
This intense activity, ¿will be sufficient to recover the shine of England before the CE?
It is not clear, since the duet Spain-Portugal counts also with numerous strong points thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (World of the 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
Nevertheless, the somber financial and economic perspectives of both countries would be able to throw down their ambitions.
The possible retaliations against the English and the doubts on the reliability of Spain and Portugal the unique thing that manage to is to give points to Russia, become an outsider of weight in spite of the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transportation).
Nevertheless, the prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to be displaced to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competition in the preparation of the voting," in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the CE.
"They are removing to shine its dirty cloths, trying to compromise them," affirmed Putin.
For 2022, the United States, that have the experience of 1994, they seem the favorite most logical.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of the FIFA, the country seems to carry him advantage to Japan and to South Korea, that have developed for separated an excellent project.
Nevertheless, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that have organized together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the World one 2026 to China, fervently desired by the FIFA, that would cause that Asia remained without possibilities for 2022.
Next to Katar, that has presented their project basing on stadiums futuristas, and Australia, the FIFA would continue with their expansion toward new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, just like Japan and Korea, would also be able to be seen damaged by the weakness of the rights of full TV (in function of the hourly difference) by the European countries, the thorn number of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
Of Gaulle really he had doubted.
Mitterrand had given understand that doubted.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not they have neither the smaller doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A mandate in the Eliseo carries to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be again candidate in 2012.
Nevertheless, the tests of it do not combine well with the mystery that is used to associating to the presidential function.
Therefore, always one must pretend that doubts itself.
Toward a side and toward the other.
In 2006, although it not to believe, the friends of Jacques Chirac affirmed that did not rule out a third mandate.
November 15, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that would make its decision "in some moment in autumn of 2011."
Therefore, the fact that treat with the representatives of the UMP, Tuesday night in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused certain commotion.
Is a matter of the official announcement of its candidacy?
Neither much less.
The so alone president indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited to two the number of mandates of five years.
Simply it transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential, with a humorous tone, in encounters of this type.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, still you will pass seven years and a half with me," had freed in July of 2009.
In another occasion, in May of 2010: "Do not think that plant not me what will come later."
Its affirmations of day before yesterday him do not approach more to the candidacy, neither neither less.
They stir up comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the career by the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal have risen to the arena what carries to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerarse.
More well to the contrary; the fact that its candidacy in 2012 turn out to be evident is what carries many people of the PS to demand that the battle be organized earlier than expected.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, the voters of right prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (the 46% set against the 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is not any discussion on the theme," has reacted immediate and sensibly the environment of the prime Minister.
"If it thinks that can lose, will not be a candidate," he thinks Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"Always it will think that can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is seen obliged to maintain its acquisitions of Letters of the State
The last meeting of the Counsel of governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should permit to need the modalities at the outset of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a great number of not conventional operations of monetary policies that should finalize to ends of year.
On account of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, the institute of emission of Frankfurt without doubt will not be able to be permitted to be so peremptory if does not want to be risked to aggravate a situation more than complicated today in the markets of European obligations.
The political price would be equal of high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the Minister of French Finances, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role performed by the ECB in favor of the solution of the crisis of the debt of the European States.
It has not wanted to say if considered that the central bank should do more, enlarging for example its state obligations purchase program.
"I reserve me my opinion for my European companions...."
The eve, in Brussels, during its audience before the Commission of Monetary and Economic Matters of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, itself was not shown more eloquent as for its intentions, indicating only that the Letters purchase program of the State in the secondary market "continued" and that "already we will see what we decide" during the meeting on Thursday.
The unique thing that remains clear is that the ECB is going to maintain its main invariable type in the 1%, the lower level of its history from May of 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasure on the part of the ECB has duplicated itself last week until reaching near 1,350 million euro.
Besides, according to the indiscreet users of the market, yesterday would have bought again Portuguese and Irish titles.
On the whole, the central banks of the eurosistema have acquired titles by an amount of 67,000 million euro from May of 2010.
Among the users of the market, itself does not it doubt more minimum that they will continue the purchases (consult the page 29).
The economists neither prevén no significant changes of course.
Although the operations of loans at more than three months already have disappeared of the arsenal of the ECB, this still carries out unlimited allocations of liquidity to beneficial conditions and with durations that vary between a week and three months.
The economists expect that today this device during some months be prolonged.
"Do not I imagine that be going to modify considerably its program."
"If not, raid the new risk to cause short-term tensions," thinks Michael Schubert, economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more probable than a progressive exit be produced announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates for its side Norbert Bräms, economist in Salt.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the interventions in the market of the public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of said obligations so that the market be maintained stable," adds Norbert Bräms.
Keeping in mind the importance of the expositions of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the zone of the euro, the institute of emission does not have more option than maintaining its presence in the market.
"It should compensate at any price the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way that impede an ascent marked of the performances credited by the most fragile States," an important agent of obligations thought yesterday.
Because, if the interest rates are put for the clouds, the States will have still more problems to reduce their indebtedness, or even to stabilize it.
This it is the price to protect to the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi escapes the temporary one
After Italy have begun the week of a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the types of the obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
On the way out of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have affirmed that they listened to Giulio Tremonti to qualify the situation of "incomprehensible" and that a weekend was expected "unforeseeable," statements contradicted subsequently by the interested.
In every case, Tuesday the difference with the German long-term types they had reached the figure record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had shot itself to the 263 points, causing a certain commotion in Rome.
In the Cabinet, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was over 400 basic points.
But its right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "deeply worried" by "the turmoils in the markets" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the zone of the euro, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the associated incomes to the same one, what causes that the State run the risk of be not able to face its needs of financing.
The last forecasts of Brussels have supposed a pitcher of cold water for the government.
It is calculated that the Italian growth will reach the 1.1% in 2011 and the 1.4% in 2012, while the budget that is being examined in the Senate is based on some figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent the 4.3% of the GDP next year (set against the 3.9% predicted by the government) and the 3.5% in 2012 (instead of the 2,7%).
From there the rumor that they can be applied new budgetary dispositions after the festivals, by an amount of 7,000 million euro.
"In necessary case, they should be adopted new measures of austerity," the Commissioner of Economic Matters thinks, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy counts on the support of the international institutions.
"The bases of its economy are in order and its accounts in good condition, like we carry saying since time ago," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, neither to short neither long-term, because in spite of its considerable debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts of requested stabilization to Italy are smaller that them required to other countries," comments Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OCDE.
Remains the problem of the political instability.
December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will be faced to a motion of reproof in the Camera of Representatives, after which they would be able to be anticipated the elections to the end of March.
In such case, a favorable little period to it would be opened takes of decisions in case of a serious crisis.
The Europeans reflect on the reinforcement of the mechanisms of fight against the crisis
Christine Lagarde already has the repeated yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I believe that already we have shown Sunday, at night and by the day, that the Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, compromised with the defense of their currency and of their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relajamiento registered yesterday in the types of the obligations of the European States has prompted to the governments and to the ECB.
Nevertheless, we cannot speak still of a principle of normalization.
The agency of Standard qualification & Poor' s announced that would be able to descend the qualification of the debt of Portugal, the white most frequent one currently of the speculations.
"Just like in May, lack really clarity and political transparency, which weighs significantly on the banking systems," the economists think of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political rhythm is a lot more slow than the rhythm of the markets."
Conscious of this hiatus and of the dangers that hides, the European countries intensify the debates to reinforce the mechanisms at the outset of the already existing crisis.
The informal consultations among the Ministers of Finances that are seen more directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts of the G-20 they go for good road.
And this keeping in mind also the meetings of the Eurogrupo and of the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB gathers today.
In the order of business, the type of not conventional measures of support to the countries of the zone of the euro in the colimador of markets (consult further up).
As for the European Fund of Financial Stability (FEEF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has initiated Tuesday in Singapore a traveled through by Asia to inform the investors of the Far East on the news of the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits does not consist of collecting funds, without doubt paves the way.
It is foreseen that the first emissions of titles of the FEEF be carried out the next month.
Yesterday, an official representative American has trusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of the funds mobilized by means of an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
As for the countries that are found in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these be to prepared to adopt you reform structural, particularly in relation to the organization of the labor market.
These reforms add to the measures of austerity with a more nearby effect.
Lisbon and Madrid they want to advance for a different road to which they continued Greece and Ireland.
Both they want to avoid at any cost to request helps international before applying its own budgetary corrections and of deciding the structural reforms that consider indispensable to enlarge the confidence of lasting form.
The capitalist associates of the European funds, finally, the available options are presented to accelerate the process of normalization of the markets of public obligations.
In transit by Paris, November 24, Axel Weber was the first one in launching the idea that, if the 750,000 million euro mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not doubt in removing again the accounts receivable.
The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of first line in the market of the European public debt, they consider that an amount of around 100,000 million additional euro would be sufficient, "preferably" in the shape of direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument for it exists: the European mechanism of gifted, financial stabilization currently with 60,000 million euro.
A counsel that, without doubt, they would be able to examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of market get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 on alert orange departments
The snow-covered they continue causing difficulties of circulation, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and they can affect to diverse economic activities.
At present, twenty-four departments are found on alert orange due to the risk of snow-covered and of formation of ice.
Eure, Eure-or-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added to the twenty departments that already they were on alert orange, eighteen from Wednesday to the half a day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, they joined with the group at night.
According to Météo France, the strong snow-covered falls affect to the north of Gironde and Charentes, although also snows slightly in Island of France.
Some blankets of snow from among 2 they are expected and 5 cm, promptly from among 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and from among 1 and 3 cm, or even to 5 cm, in the Parisian region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d' Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the of the regions of Low Normandy, Island of France and Lemosín.
The snow-covered they are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of circulation and to affect to some economic activities, warning Météo France.
In the Côtes d' Armor, the access to several departmental highways to the heavy vehicles has been prohibited of more than 7.5 tons, included the axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, for which they recommend that itself be not conducted save in an emergency and the circulation has been prohibited of you determined vehicles TER during the day.
During Thursday, has been prohibited the schools buses in Picardy.
Itself not any measure had been predicted specific Wednesday night to limit the circulation of the heavy vehicles.
The prefectura "urges all the conductors to that conduct with the greater prudence in the highways and to that adapt their conduction to the situation."
The general Direction of the civil aviation (DGAC) asked to the air companies that annulled Thursday the 25% of their flights in the Parisian airport of Roissy and the 10% in Orly on account of the snow-covered predicted.
The DGAC recommends the air passengers that be put in contact with their airline.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, to the south of London, and that of Edinburgh, in Scotland, they are closed until Thursday morning.
Meter of the Grand Paris: first financial rough drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of the transportation in the Island of France has reached their climactic point, they rain thousands of millions.
At least, in the debate.
Particularly, we speak of the 23,000 million for the meter of the Grand Paris that should build the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds of 4,000 million euro.
In the theoretical plan, this sum will be the one that will permit subsequently to the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The law of finances rectificativa of 2010, examined in the commission of finances of the Assembly National this morning, contains the devices predicted to find the first part of that money.
Two ways exist: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase of the tax on the offices in the Island of France.
The first one, we as read in the article 15 of the text of the government bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
Besides, it is set in numbers: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euro to the year."
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize it, to enlarge its product and to destine said increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much it would be obtained with this method?
Who knows.
In the text not figures are given.
But is far from 4,000 million.
"I need that the fiscal resources are added to the 4,000 million euro of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris to the extent that advance the project," we can read in the exposition of motives.
To the SGP not this system surprises him.
"From the moment that incomes are created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and later to receive the 4,000 million later, we as explain."
"It will be registered in the budget and will be utilized in function of the needs."
The SGP calculates that will harm to receive the 4,000 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which the 4,000 million promised do not they figure in the credit, can cause a slightly on parliamentary debate.
The first public session will be December 7.
Hackers avenging and diligent spies
The matter WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, an apparent scandal is watchful, a scandal that so alone scandal before the hypocrisy seems that governs the relations among the States, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, announces deep changes to international scale and foresees a future dominated by the decline.
But we go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expedient created by a secret service (independently of the nation to which belong) is formed exclusively by cuts of press.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on the sexual customs of Berlusconi so alone reflect what has written since months ago in any newspaper (except the ones that they belong to Berlusconi) and the sinister derisive profile of Khadafi carries a lot of time giving ideas to the artists of cabaret to create its sketches.
The norm according to which the so alone secret expedients should be formed by news of public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not alone in this century.
If it visits a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, will see that each work repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-him-Château, the Templars or the Rosacruz) exactly what there was itself written in the previous works.
This not themselves due only to that the occultists texts authors not quieran to do unpublished investigations (or know not where to seek news on the nonexistent thing), but because who they are dedicated to the not so alone occultism they trust in which already they know, what reconfirma that that already had learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of they Give Brown.
The same thing applies to the secret expedients.
The reporter is lazy, just like he is lazy (or he has little anxiety) the leader of the secret services (if could not be, I what know, writer of the Libération), that only considers certain what can recognize.
The information top secret on Berlusconi that sent the American embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same one that published the Newsweek the previous week.
Then, ¿why have they caused such commotion the revelations of these expedients?
On the one hand, so alone they say what every person cultivated already knows, that is to say, that the embassies, at least from World War Two and since the Leaders of States can be called by telephone or to catch the airplane to be met to have dinner, they have lost their diplomatic function and, except for some exercises limited of representation, they have been transformed into centers of espionage.
Any spectator that see movies of investigation knows him perfectly, so alone we pretend that him do not we know for hypocrisy.
In every case, the fact to repeat it publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
In second place, the idea that a hacker any can consult the secrets more secrets of the most powerful country of the world affects considerably to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects so much the victims as to the "executioners."
But we enter the true nature of what has passed.
Old, in the epoch of Orwell, would be able to be conceived to all to be able as a Big Brother that controlled each gesture of its subjects.
The prophecy of Orwell has done reality since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction carried out, hotel visited, freeway taken, the citizen was converted of this way in a complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when it is shown, as occurs now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of the power cannot escape to the control of a hacker, the relation of control to stops being one-way and returns to circulate.
The power controls each citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, chosen like the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can it be endured a power that no longer nor to conserve its own secrets?
It is certain, as already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a secret empty (and an empty secret will never be able to be alert); is also certain that every knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or of Merkel is in reality an empty secret, without secret, since proceeds of the public environment; but to be watchful, as has done WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets signifies to remove him all to be able.
WikiLeaks has not done any damage to Sarkozy or to Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and to Obama.
Which will they be the consequences of this injury caused to a so powerful power?
It turns out to be evident that, in the future, the States no longer will be able to put in the not a single network information reserved, since would be like to publish it in a placard in full street.
But also it turns out to be evident that, with the current technologies, itself cannot be expected to maintain confidential conversations by telephone.
Nothing turns out to be more easy than discovering if and when a Head of state has been displaced in airplane and he has himself placed in contact with one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain in the future confidential and private relations?
I know perfectly that, for the moment, my forecast is thing of science fiction and, therefore, fabulous, but I imagine governmental agents that displace themselves of discreet form in diligence with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned by memory or, like a lot, hiding some data writings in the heels of their shoes.
That information is conserved then, in an only copy, in drawers locked: after all, the intent of espionage of the Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that the technology at present advances as a crab, that is to say, backwards.
A century after the telegraph without cables have revolutionized the communications, Internet has created again a telegraph with cables (telephone).
The videotapes (analog) had permitted the investigators of the movies to study a movie step by step, advancing and going back, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CD (digital) only they permit to advance or to go back of chapter in chapter, that is to say, to enormous proportions.
With the high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in airplane, with the displacements that involves, we need three hours and a half.
Therefore, it is not swum out of the normal thing that the politics and the techniques of communication carry us again to the carriages.
A last comment.
Old, the press tried to understand what itself tramaba in secret in the embassies.
Currently, they are the embassies the ones that ask confidential information to the press.
Climate: you duck them of France in its promises of financing
A year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, is hour to examine if the promises of financing have been respected quickly released (calls fast start or premature) carried out by the countries developed.
And they have themselves alert you duck them Frenchwomen.
In the Agreement of Copenhagen, the countries developed compromised to provide 30,000 million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union compromised to contribute 7,200 million euro in three years and France 1,260 million euro (that is to say, 420 million to the year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has placed on the table its better letters to convince its associates that its commitment with the financings fast start is true: a report detailing the measures of its member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, the distribution of pamphlets...
The appreciable operation transparency turned out and was appreciated for which really is worth: the developing countries and the civil company would want that all the countries developed did the same thing and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that has freed 2010 2,200 million euro, which situates it in the good road toward the compliance of its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, the things are more complicated.
According to the Agreement of Copenhagen, the money should be "new and additional" to guarantee that be carried out a complementary effort, without damage to the official aid to the development.
Unfortunately, itself it has not arrived at an agreement on what signifies "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonization, some member States, included France, they have blocked the procedure.
Currently, each which chooses the reference that more agrees him.
For example, the European Commission has taken as reference the year 2009: is maintained the international financing and they are added 150 million in three years in concept of financing fast start.
Other countries have elected similar references as for the year or at the level of the official aid to the development.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all the new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, itself does not refer to the expenses of the previous years neither at the total level of the official aid to the development.
In concrete, the total amount of the aid from France to the developing countries can remain stable (or even to diminish), while intends that respects its commitment in matter of funds "new and additional..."
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once more, not any norm exists and each which chooses the method of calculation.
Some, like France, they consider that each euro lent equals to a euro donated.
Evidently, such thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the utilization of loans can be justified for you determined investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), turns out to be deceptive to present a euro that is going to recover as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As a lot, only should be computed for its commitments the price of the loan for the country that grants the loan (that is to say, the equivalent one to an interest rate).
But France does not find useful such reasoning: "It respects" its commitment of 420 million euro doing a 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euro) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euro); consult the document of the EU to see it for its own eyes.
It is a matter of the only country of the Union that utilizes so often the loan.
Germany utilizes it in a 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, they respect their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes a euro to comply its commitment, France so alone contributes ten hundredth and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
All in all, in its financing fast start, France carries out a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in the time and, by another, in relation to the true financial effort.
Spending so alone 36.1 million euro, the impression manages to give that spends 420 million "new and additional," just as had promised.
The handling of the Department of Finances (because seems that is Bercy who has been occupied of the arbitration) could have a double so much, negative impact inside the EU (¿why went the other member States to continue donating when simply can lend?) as in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fools...
The chapter of the premature financing is a trifle, relating to short time limit, in relation to the assembly of the negotiations on the climate.
But could be a grain of sand of more in the immense machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We expect that be not thus.
Be what fuere, turns out to be indispensable to learn of this first year of premature financings.
In the first place, France would be able to announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect its commitments and in the same way that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France would be able to do that they advanced the debates on the bets in play in relation to the long-term financing (another essential chapter that is debating at present): us we will not free of the question of the "additional character" neither of the method to compute the loans.
France would be able to change his position to be returned so progressive in relation to this question as is him with other.
Therefore, the hope of the new Minister of Environment remains us, the lady Kosciusko-Morizet, that will arrive at Cancun next week.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of France and on its vision of the "additional character" and of the utilization of the loans would contribute to improve the level of necessary international confidence to advance in the negotiations.
Warning on the pesticides consumed by the children
A boy of 10 years consumes in a day 81 different chemical substances, as indicates a study published Wednesday by the association Générations Futures (the old movement by the rights and the respect of the future generations).
The association, that notifies that its results "do not have a significant statistical value keeping in mind the limited number of samples analyzed, but they are illustrative of the treated problems," acquired in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the food that is used to consuming a boy of some ten years in four foods and a snack to the day.
These foods taken as model, that respect the official recommendations (five parts of fruits and fresh vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water to the day), as well as the delicacies, they were examined in the laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the dish turns out to be oppressing: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified like carcinogenic sure, as well as 37 susceptible substances to act as disruptive endocrine (PE), according to the studies of diverse institutions as the international Center of investigation on the cancer.
"Although, in practically the totality of the cases, itself not the legal limits are surpassed for each one of the chemical substances individually, our study shows clearly that the exposition of the consumers to possibly carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE turns out to be worrying," indicates the association.
For the breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk contain in and of itself more than about ten possible carcinogenic residues and three you considered as carcinogenic sure, as well as near about twenty residues that can damage to the hormonal system.
The apple, imported of Brazil, predicted like snack for the school, contains plans of six chemical substances, included a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same thing applies to the green beans of Kenya, included in the food, in which the study has detected plans of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
Besides, the Russian fillet, the canned tuna and even the bar of bread or the chewing gum they were adorned with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the supper, the slice of salmon was the more "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the dish of plastic utilized to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails of contaminants" for the consumer "probably underestimates itself," the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Them Verts (States-LV), in turn, has proposed "set against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the utilization of pesticides to brake "the increase of the associated illnesses to the civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency of Eating Security (AESA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 identifying different pesticides in the fruit and the greenness consumed in Europe, of which 76 in the cereals.
