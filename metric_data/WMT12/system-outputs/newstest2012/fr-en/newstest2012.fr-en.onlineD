The Parliament didn't ratify amendment for the liberalisation of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament refused opposition leader, in her frame of an amendment to criminal law, plan of cancellation of paragraph relating to the charge of Julia Tymosenko.
The deputies refused in second reading the plan of modification aiming at the reduction of troubles for economic offences, which would have been able to open the doors of freedom for the ex-first Minister currently arrested.
Tymosenko was condemned in October in 7 years of prison to have entered into an agreement in priori disadvantageous with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
Judgement isn't final and the court must give a ruling on the call of the convicted prisoner in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgement of political revenge of regime and caused a process of suspicion of partiality of the court also on the West.
Plan to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the ex-Premère Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 deputies.
226 voices would have been needed to approve him.
Libyan victory
Liberalisation or Libyan the rebellion already has her losers.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him war is ended.
It remains to determine the victors.
As he is of custom in the region, the victors on elections are the islamists, but it is of moderates or radical.
Interim National Council decreed the habitual right of the Sharia and we already know about what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight the hand is cut.
The women can forget emancipation, the not respectful possible dela faith are liable by capital punishment...
It is the Koran which is going to join instead of the personality of the dictator the society composed of compared tribes.
In règnera Libya such order as we can't imagine it and as we wouldn't surely like.
But our way of life isn't unique, the best isn't objectively and wouldn't be probably favourable for the Libyan.
It is particularly amazing that the Islamic warriors accepted assistant with gratitude of faithless dogs.
The only excuse it is because it isn't an américian general who ran the striking of NATO but rather Allah whose size they celebrated in every attack.
When it is therefore a question of searching the victors in Libya, Occident isn't part of it
We participated in shooting, served Islam and our poilitiques turned away from the dictator as political ally without its bringing no benefit.
After the recent bad experiments of Afghanistan and Iraq, we don't occupy Libya militarily.
He not there therefore no problem for the places to débarasser of "crusaders".
Without occupation of the soil, the oil societies will have easily accés in the libyien black gold.
Perhaps not so much and Occident will be able finally to brag about a desintéressée protection of human rights.
If prevent us from it these supporters of the sharia.
A new epoch of crisis begins.
France and rest of Europe are in the viewfinder of the investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday on Europe.

The GDP of Germany has a growth envisaged of 0,5 %, that of 0,4 % France.
Both countries changed data for the second quarter in the course of which Germany better was situated than envisaged (0,3 % growth instead of envisaged 0,1 %), however France mentioned a light 0,1 % reduction (it was a matter at the origin of inactivity).
Czech economy had a 1,5 % growth in the course of the third quarter.
But the GDP stagnated and according to the Office of Czech statistics it is confirmed that they head for a progressive reduction of economic growth.

The Czech qualified themselves for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate skills for 200 millions
The representation of football achieved its most difficult mission of season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to great Cech and at the security guard Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football dearly defended its skills with also a good part of chance in the second part and won't miss the European championship.
IHNED.CZ followed qualification match with a detailed report.
No particular glow in the course of the first part and the big part of chance for the second.
Czech representation also won thanks to great Cech and at the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its skills in the European championship.
Monténégrains met under pressure to in the second part because of a definite Czech defence.
The vicitmes of match was Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to great Petr Cech Czech representation won't be away in the European championship next year, and in more a reward of 200 million crowns in the case of Czech football.
From the first minutes warlike football was played.
Both teams succeeded hardly in taking combinations up and game concentrated mainly around the red line.
The pressure of the national footballers didn't succeed in piercing the Czech defence which answered long shooting in a definite way even during the first mi - time.
The Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a human shield
A few hundred students of colleges of higher education created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support by this gesture the nuclear programme of their country facing a possible Israeli attack.
The students started to pray at midday in front of the site and then desired death of HAD and from Israel.
A few hundred students of the universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technological centre of Ispahan where is transformed the uranium.
They so expressed openly that they would defend the programme nuclaire of their country at the risk of their own lives.
The international Agency for nuclear energy (AIEA) noted in its last information that Iran didn't cease reinforcing its nuclear weaponry.
They mention in Israel of a possible attack of the Iranian nuclear establishments.
The students started to pray at midday in front of the site and then desired death of HAD and from Israel.

The feeding of an obese child: has breakfast not and takes some meat products for dinner
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 years old has problems of overweights, 9 % écoliersont a weight above average and 5 % are obese.
As show it current researches the obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
It shows once again to what extent is important the middle in which evolves the human being and the models which encircle him.
On the tables of the obese children some meat products 50 % more often than in children's families in normal weight are found for example.
19 % of obese had chips in dinner according to the inquiry led with an action of sensitisation "Obesity isn't a chance"
In the families of the small wholesale trades sports aren't also a habit, what is now case of most today's schoolchildren - only 15 % answered that at least one time a week the parents found the time for active movement.
Led investigation into 900 children
The inquiry took place during last school year and 900 pupils of the primary schools of Czechia participated.
It was the second edition "Obesity isn't a chance", sustained action by the general Insurance of health and the Unilever society.
Since the beginning it is more than 12000 pupils of sixth in the third that registered in this plan.
One of the decisive factors who cause a dramatic increase among children in overweight, or even obese, is the absence, of a correct feeding and not enough physical exercise.
"Only the half of the questioned children points out eating baby for example 5 times a day to have lunch on it case - lunch - to taste dinner, which is the one basic principles of a good feeding", points out one of the results of the inquiry.
Without breakfast and meat products in dinner
The specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development are needed some basic details such as a breakfast in family at the same hour.
In Czechia, only 23 % of families pupils eat in my same hour.
In the most part of families each has breakfast alone.
And the worst who was raised is that a tenth of the population takes breakfast in no way.
Breakfast is however the base of a good daily feeding.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of the obese children unhealthy chips are more often used.
Almost every pupil - without speaking about weight - drinks every day of sweetened drinks (70 %).
More than 40 % questioned children made by sports regularly but for the parents it is about the half, only 15 %.
Prepare your feeding you
Another part of the inquiry allowed to chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own feeding from possibilities offered according to their clean taste and their personal opinion.
"The preferences of the Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far, on the plan of healthy feeding, of ideal".
Among their flat favourites there are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most frightening is notably a big preference for sweet lemonade", is pointed out in the results of the inquiry.
For lunch it is pasta which took the first fair place in front of the white meat.
The children wanted in no way starchies and preference for fish and meals of vegetables was very weak.
Cape on health
The inquiry also showed that the children are ready to change their habits as soon as they receive information ad hoc.
"In the course of a control of a group of participants in the inquiry who had filled the questionnaire after the session of sensitisation "Obesity isn't a chance", they have assité in a will caused well to head for a" healthy feeding, point out the results of the inquiry.
The most notable was for example as for sweet lemonade because the children began giving preference to the water of consumption.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire the white meat and the fish as main course and would reduce sweet dishes and "Knedliky" (spécialté Czech of pellets of flour of bread or of potatoes).
The fashion designer must be also a good psychologist, say the professionals
In an article of presentation relating to the way of teaching for the fashion designers, I a little got angry due to the fact that there was very from the beginning.
I didn't think of what is later going to arrive.
Accounts of three professionals of speciality, clothing of the characters and a seminar on what takes place on the spot.
And it will be worse.
The more we approach final examinations and the more wait for us practical exercises and information.
And even when there are courts Saturdays and Sundays it is really "filled ".
This time we have with the head Alenka (in lesson there is no boy) treaty of way d' to dress the woman without measurements standards.
And women of this type it is the majority.
The one has a small neck, other one boy's body, without particular curve, other one of the overweight.
The fashion designer must know how to optiquement ammenuiser broad arms, extend a neck or top up necessary curves.
We succeeded so in underlining the character nicely and also in not dressing in a too showy way types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and marked hips and a fine size.
If there is a difference for example between size and hips so that skirts or trousers pass in no way, it is worth the effort having of it made made to order.
And you won't regret it because the clothing which falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a skirt made to order you will much better feel than in the one who slides permanently, winds and isn't fond of the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance have is possible afford a clothing of style Tucker, with pieces of sewed cloths, or still embroideries.
There are course a lot of examples d 'various appearance and I am happy that I have all week to sort out all received information.
But I am also afraid that taken into account what I must make at home there is too much.
Every trainee received a publicity to be dressed for day and party.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of mode of the personality as well as its appearance.
I will have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know Victoria's Secret of the countryside.
In the bottom of me, it pleases me, because it is better that to dress Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilogrammes recently (don't take my statement, svp, completely seriously) or the young person Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or search on Internet, print and work the style of drawing.
Moodboard, as they say for final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relation with graphic creation.
To think also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The fashion designer doesn't dress physical appearance so only but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products tendencies for handbags, topcoats, etc).
Mario Kamenik, fashion designer and graphic designer, maintained to us all that.
But it, until Sunday
The fashion designer must have a general vision
Three guests of speciality gave an aspect diversified in the session of Saturday filled with information on different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, fashion designer, Jakub Polanka graphic designer of mode and Well Renc, photographer of mode.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is a phantasm and the fashion designer should be able to use it.
And a talented fashion designer can work with the single clothing in a different way.
Changeability is for this primordial example.
As for example this trench coat which has to to be carried in a classical way with jeans and T-shirt as light topcoat but also he can dress also the bare body, with court shoes and take a photo of it as a dress.
Or it is enough to take back up handles or collar and to have immediately a new look.
"Play with it" he underlined.
But I particularly appreciated following advice: "For job you need to know rules perfectly".
"You can then begin contravening it", said Jakub.
Finally I understand why they try hard to learn these rules, what to make with, towards that, why, while in the magazines of mode something else is sometimes seen.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know once again, thanks to the photographer of mode Well that the fashion designer must have much more variants of clothing than those who are photographed.
That is that for fashion story who will have a dozen pages (therefore a dozen models) I must be ready to "re-sharpen " at least about fifteen.
And also, clothes and his combination with other elements appear completely differently that in reality.
We must count with it in the course of a creation of a model.
The fact that picture and style sometimes make the half of the succés was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
It is enough to look at Madonna who isn't a great singer but her picture and marketing made a worldwide star.
In Czechia, the approach towards the use of the services of the fashion designers remains still sensitive to the cold.
And the known faces sometimes consider them as useless (I just have to know something but what I parry master key in the second rank).
And if somebody has a styling made of our part, we must then count on the fact that he dictates us with a big likelihood a completely different size (smaller) than the one that he has in reality.
It remains us then that to sail google and to make sure if information of boulevard mentions publicity in question, if it slimmed or grew etc...
Honza and Mario posed us on Sunday on the heart qu 'the fashion designer doesn't only have to turn in fashion and to be able to put models together.
He must communicate with the persons whom he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Be able to guess people, not pride itself, keep his opinion.
"When one manager asks you to sort it out his cupboard and to fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and say to everything him, My God which horror."
"You will find some business which you will think pretty and to him whom you will recommend with what to carry them", says Mario.
This one showed us in concrete terms what contain must everything what is called "Placovka" or bag of the fashion designer.
It is the one that you hang around size and that you have on one as all what you need.
Besides things apparently defined as scissors, rolls for depilation or still safety pins, they also find there the thread of nylon (that the fashion designer uses to photograph products as bags, or hats), special pop videos with which one to close clothes in the back, if he is too big (the pin or other type of staple aren't utlisables because they could damage the clothes) or a kit of sewing.
So that we soyions not only people who listen but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how ressemeller correctly shoes.
And in the course of session photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, a fortiori in lextérieur.
And so we stuck and stuck.
We didn't have the right to touch scissors not to hurt themselves through inadvertence.
Competences are really needed therefore.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The comptence whom I mention isn't for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learnt in the course of the second weekend of court
I begin more and more understanding that to make a profession of the styling isn't a promenade in a garden of roses, that each says what about it what he wants.
The need of speed Run argues across all America.
Revision
Originates a running without problem is transformed because of group of stupid errors of persons of it with nothing to make in a morning displacement routine at job.
It fills up to some measure the ambition of each but it is not used for anything if nobody feels like doing something furthermore.
The captioned rematch The Run produced big waitings before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the series of running already old Need for Speed and to go out a kind of game from the playable parts which would be counted not only with points.
We were therefore curious how passages topped up are going to be in the course of which the hero main fate of its car and fact what he wants.
As it is already made in series NFS, result is completely other than what one atttendait.
These are potentially games of running of arcades but group pulls downwards because of some useless errors which exist already for several years.
These aren't really errors but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on behalf of the developers.
Adventure very well begins.
You are taken in the adventure the main hero Jack of which has caractériels problems and to regulate them starts to participate in illegal shopping across America.
You sit down behind the steering wheel on the west coast in San Fransisco and your mission is to arrive the first at New York.
Idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then besides 50 shopping.
What results from it who every running becomes on another route and stages envisaged in different environments which distinguish themselves well enough some of others and is interesting.
The player has no feeling the single instant that game offers him something identical.
Some environments are of surcroit rather pretty even if graphic technical level is the same type as the previous series.
Finally it isn't the world's end.
But the behaviour across the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very nice visually.
Tests are besides time at time livened up with an atypical élement.
For example in the desert you are in one storm of sand which diminishes you in a sensitive way visibility.
Then in mountains you must pay attention an avalanche not to throw you over.
Next to it different shopping is ranked well to them some behind others.
There is only only the small number but it is enough.
He there instants you try hard to surpass the number asked by adversaries (as in a classical running) then you will run against the watch (classical duel with the chronometre) and then still wait you for another duel with an adversary.
From time to time you also have the police which enters game and that tries to return you dificile situation.
Novelty passages except vehicle are.
It is rather about una interactive animation when mostly Jack runs away in front of somebody and you must help him by knocking the good button timely.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising it is that there are less than instants of this type than for what you wait (to be concrete there is only three).
In result it is well as it because this element doesn't risk bothering and is situated, in the context described above, in the elements which liven game up.
The model of behaviour is in the tradition of the previous games.
What means that currently there is nothing extraordinary but it isn't possible to say that it is negative.
As for realistic simulation you will have to go to see elsewhere.
But that it is possible to find better in the conccurrence the model of behaviour go, please, with the type of conception of shopping.
Therefore everything is ok.
Problems begin appearing after some time.
In the diffférence of the model of behaviour, that of collisions isn't still in the point.
We don't expect from this game for a complicated distortion and for collisions, but when you have, during a collision with any object, no slightest idea of the way your auto acts, it isn't therefore completely good.
In the course of gripped overtakings you sometimes feel each other mutually slightly but in another way your auto leaves in mad stunt flying.
Or is in crumbs.
Thanks to the system of upturn it isn't really a problem but it really irritates you.
Upturn is made so that when you crashed or you went out in the decor game brings you back at the time of the last point on the route.
But you have only only 5 upturns.
When you used 5 upturns you must start again game since the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, for case where something doesn't take place properly, that quelquechose on whom you can really count.
Sometimes upturns don't help and it is necessary to find solution in by remémorrant of memory the piece of route in question.
The big hitch of this game it is because the same actions meet in the same places.
For example there are some turns that it is necessary to pass some way of one otherwise it doesn't pass.
In another way you meet on a place given by the "civil" vehicles always in the same shape as you arrived the first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or slow one minute.
What makes angry these are situations when you see passing the adversary easily between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you, it is needed you is to put on of side and conturner or to brake.
It is equal if you go owing - him because it is "calculated" so that for given situation he always arrives very close to your nose.
The adversaries still have other advantages.
During at all times of game, you, you arrive in some places, again without caring about time, and you always have the same adversary who precedes you in the same place.
It irritates most at the end of game when you run on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The adversary must pass at all costs in front of you.
When he passes in front of you he hides from you the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you enter collision a good many of time.
It is possible to understand that the purpose of this game is to do something of captivating and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you get bored fast.
And it is damage because through a model of simple behaviour game is interesting and places with so much action as you have no time to follow all that takes place.
And it is equal if it is because of concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of shopping is such as there is no chance to get bored or something else.
The brain child is the change of car in the course of shopping.
You must pay attention to gasoline pumps on routes because you can change there of car however mostly the one that you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, American powerful cars for the right motorways and the great sports cars in the exotic finery on very technical behaviours for example on roads in lace in mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are shopping in particular places that you know adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience which are added to your profile which is common in challenges and in adventure.
When you attained driver's highest level, different objects begin unbarring:
This one is connected online with the function Autolog which between others compares your results got with those of other players and give you other functions in the community.
One of the most hard to understand blows is the situation of the last running of adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the underground (this resembles) where you run in darkness on ways (this resembles).
Your indicator of speed points out to you between 150 and 200 km / hour (in priori) and behind you an oar of underground arrives which sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
In the writing we had a debate during some days to be known if somebody indeed thought during the creation of this game or if the authors really take us for fools.
The technical part of game isn't extra, but the visual part is in general nice and great in certain cases really.
What bothers it is that in more extreme situations, imagery doesn't hold level and in certain cases in a tragic way.
It concerns accidents especially with a big number of participants when a fluid imagery isn't any more of no use to you.
The sound part is good and the track is in the choice.
With the intention of pleasing the biggest number and particularly most the young public a new sound track was created in style "I blend everything", but it is possible to expect what nobody will buy game for music.
General impression of Need for Speed: Run is therefore confused really.
If game didn't have these stupid errors we could say without fear that it is about the best production of NFS these last years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
Entertainment is really well but prepare you errors for typing to you in eyes with the force of a reflector of airfield.

Vice-nova, Ambassador near the européeenne Union:
The Czechs act as negativists and eurosceptics
"The treaty of Lisbon radically abolished balance between institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war".
"It will last 5,6 years before situation calms down and before all players get used to their new role", that's how Miléna Vicenova began its account in the Faculty of Right the Czech ambassador near the European Union.
When she succeeded in describing the different organs of the EU and their relations in a so comprehensible and visible way, to the point where a big number of lecturers of the faculty of Right of the University Charles could envy her, she showed to what extent she takes her comprehensible "motto and openly regarding Europe" very seriously.
Madam Vicenova paid tribute to the job of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning the critics resounded that he is flavorless, that it is a rond-de-cuir, that he can rempplir no mission and I must say that he took breath away from everybody because he plays his role in perfection".
"It is a man who can listen to 27 member states, good communicate with them and has a clear vision of direction to be taken of Europe".
She explained the new post of the High representative for foreign affairs and the politics of defence as part of an answer to question: "Who is who to the European Union? ""To what telephone number must I call?", therefore as a step mattering towards uniqueness and a bigger legibility of the politics of the Union facing states, as is China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (cheese with paste gets pissed which very extremely smells)
Madam Vicenova also mentioned the agenda which lived, and will live in close time the European Council.
She qualified the Czech presidency of two years ago of succés.
The Czech solved going up financial crisis, crisis of the gas or organised a Summit for an Oriental Partnership.
She qualified the fall of the gourvernement as very negative and harmed the picture of the Czech Republic.
The representation Czech to the EU is very occupied at present.
According to madam's words Ambassador, "activity was in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues being even resolved now.
It is more necessary to approve there the new septimal budget of the Union which becomes very complicated because of current financial status.
As it would seem that the budget will be slim and with the aim of savings, which branch will take precedence, which countries will be helped most, least, everything is to solve as part of future negotiations.
Madam Ambassador reminded of her slogans with which she arrived at Brussels "For comprehensible Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons which nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or crooked pickles, bananas big differemment either that nobody forbade to us to make syrecky".
She better wants to use the environment of the EU and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.
Europe at several speed waits for us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have reputation to be eurosceptics and people who see the things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Furthermore she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
Error results, according to her, several factors, as for example the bashfulness of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and a weak support of the Czech part.
Besides a Czech presidency in succés she then underlined force and cooperation of the group of Visegrad.
"Believe me, when come towards me the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak, this Frenchman says to me: 'Eh, that estce that you make there, that this group of Visegrad still makes? "and he is happy in no way".
According to Madam Vicenova, in close future it is new hard rules in fiscal policy that wait for countries members.
It is the concept of dual Europe, if it isn't at several speed, which predominates rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others out of the zone."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute of reinforced cooperation".
Above all it was said that the countries collaborate between them which want it and those who don't want it stay in their corner."
"There will be d a lot' institutes of this type and there will be Europe really dual", Madam Vicenova expects.
From this point of view she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and of Herman Van Rompuye to determine bases according to which all topics having an impact on the EU must be discussed between all members of the EU and not only memebres of the eurozone.
History of a mark:
INNOVATOR IBM begins the second century of his existence
If somebody had to search the term which expresses in most near strategy IBM, the closest would be " the long term ".
For broad public IBM the symbol of technological revolution is, is a felt business company as very current and however since its creation it passed hundred years.
The base of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first leader of the business company, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left this slogan qu' a big number of worldwide problems can be regulated if people are eager to think.
His slogan "THINKS'! "became the footprint around which is going to develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the magazine commits that IBM began editing in 1935).
It was the base of the culture of the firm soignement worked out by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of uninterrupted movements run to future.
IBM survived hundred years thanks to the fact that she always remained faithful to the basic stocks and however wasn't afraid to change all the others around her.
It allowed us in the course of our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "has délaré for the birthday the current manager of the business company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A system well prepared
Watson, in the thirties, started to take care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - people of IBM were the only ones among the first American employees to have paid holiday, an insurance paid by the employer more an uniform of elegant employee and a system worked out well by rewards for the inventors and commmerciaux.
Similarly IBM has a sytème of relations with the client well worked out.
The society was at the beginning brilliant in talented discovery as one of the first business companies to have abolished any form of discrimination and could so have the choice.
Current plan is completely in the spirit of anti-discriminating strategy since it will be a woman Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
This one works at the place of IBM for thirty years and occupies currently the post of Sales manager, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in the course of last years made what they call of the jamy, of the online brain-storming from that come a lot of future strategies and innovations.
It isn't amazing that he has a lot of ideas - in the business company there is about 500000 persons who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external picture of the firm who assure him a sure position in domains of business.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept rather of institution than a technological business company", said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of economy at the School of economy of Harvard and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM isn't a technlogique business company but a business company which helps to resolve problems of the world of the business by using its technology", added Geogre Colony of the business company of Consulting Forrester Research.
As said the business company itself there is a difference enters to enter on the market and to create this market.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as her name is familiarly to the United States taken into account its slogan in hundred years it grew to the point of becoming one of the biggest worldwide business companies.
It is of course the most polyvalent technological business company - she develops software, hardwares, facilities, accommodation, services of Council at the level of the products of the server up to nanotechnology.
She has many patents of all American technological business companies and five of her employees received a Nobel prize.
Among its discoveries forms a line for example the cash dispenser, the direct debit card, financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was this year with 220 thousand million dollars the second biggest technological business company according to the capitalisation of the market (the first one is Apple), when for the first time it exceeded Microsoft in 1996.
Seen ahead of time
It isn't all innovations and manufacture that had the preference of the client and of epoch - IBM for example didn't achieve bet on a clean operational system BONE / 2, of service online Prodigy or of the computer IBM PCJR:
"As soon as your business is built on movement ahead of time you can't émotionellement remain hung on past, "having pointed out Samuel J. Palmisano.
For it IBM doesn't have problem to build its bases on many decks and when they don't work she leaves.
In difference for example from the conccurent Microsoft which on the base is held and resides under the operational system Windows.
A perspective technology
In incomes IBM, services, which are formed for the fifth by software and hardwares, have a preponderant place.
However still in 1990 she was with more motié of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
From year 2000 IBM she sold assets with weak output for 15 thousand million dollars, in the course of cettre period invested 58 thousand million dollars in the purchase of perspective technologies.
She goes on in investments and even from 2008, when for the first time she surpassed new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first leader Thomas J. Watson, who in the course of big economic crisis also augmented the volume of investments.
He apparait from now on that IBM passes current crisis without being worried?
The price of action IBM has progessé from 2008 in rocket of 120 pourcent, the net profit of the business company continues growing.
The logo of the business company IBM is to change everything but not its stocks.
It is possible to expect for it that this flexible giant maitrise of other crises.
History d' IBM: From the edges of cheeses up to flights in the universe.
The IBM society (International Business Machines) is born in New York hundred years ago; it had initially the name complicated with Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was about a mark used by a branch of a business company in Canada and in South America.
The base of INTENDED IBM was the fusion of four business companies history of which is linked in years 80 of ten the ninth century.
They had technologies as for example the ancient "timekeepers", the clocks which recorded arrival and departure of the employees.
The architect of the new society was Charles Ranlett Flint who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory board of the society.
Flint engaged the leader of a rival business company Thomas J. Watson to help him to run the society.
The leader made shadow then to the founder of the business company - it is on the ideas of Watson that rest up to now identity and culture of the society.
Watson ran the business company kusqu' in 1952.
IBM, as said its name, began with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - trancheuses of cheeses and of meat until cash registers.
In the course of first four years during who Watson ran, the turnover the expansion of the business company in all parts of world increased to the point of attaining 9 million dollars and began.
Watson was for the business company however irreplaceable after 40 years of direction it is his son who occupied the chair of manager, Thomas Watson junior.
Under its direction IBM the development of artificial intelligence began and developed the language first of programming.
In the sixties people and computers of IBM helped NASA has guide flights in the universe - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 flight on the Moon.
Since then in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM SYSTEM / 360.
The classical PC which determined the standard of computer of epoch with the name of IBM 5150 arrived on walked in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells the plant of computers to the Chinese society Lenovo, but bought the society of Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began taking care of advice and services with a high added value.
The strategy which succeeds in IBM these three last years - is concept Smarter Planet " a more clever planet ".
His objective is the clever uilisation of technology in domains not yet exploited as for example the transport and the management of cities.
As for the domain of trade IBM developed a short time ago a deck " Smarter Commerce " which helps the sales and marketing people to manager all commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history also on our territory.
She created her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 then first country of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also the strategical centre of outsourcing of Brno.
The Power station for the Central and Eastern Europe assembles in Prague and there is also the search party and development of the worldwide level which takes care of the recognition of word.
Rychtarova regarding her faithless husband:
Ivette you can keep this donkey, I don't bear a grudge any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years) said, it is ended!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) becomes bodyguard and lover of d' Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina still hoped that Joseph wakes up from his pink dream and comes back at home.
Only she couldn't wait and established clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come back at home, but not as my partner" Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in its home, she didn't suspect that its couple wouldn't hold.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted to move of Ricany, Pepa didn't push back the singer.
And he confessed publicly that he loved him.
With time Darina resigned itself, accepted the link of her husband and ended up saying goodbye to it forever.
Rychtirova isn't interested to know with whom her husband sleeps.
If Rychtar and Bartosova part there won't be wife to receive it on the step of the door of the home.
"It is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our community house, nobody will put him outside".
"He won't be any more my old lost and loved donkey, but a man with whom I have a particular relation", Rychtarova let leak out by showing that she broke loose from her husband but that they stay only in a decent relation.
The fact that Darina closed him the door isn't a problem for Joseph.
"I respect the decision of my wife".
"I will stay with Iveta and don't change".
"My wife set a marriage up on paper and I respect it".
"The uninterrupted society, I take care of repairs, of garden, real estate, I buy".
"With Darina they discuss in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together" Rychtar for Blesk declared.
If Rychtarova finds a new love it won't prevent him.
"We don't sleep together and he doesn't interest me of knowledge where she goes, with whom and if she has a link.
I know that it is my error, I fell in love d "Iveta and I take all responsibility on me", concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of the women: It also concerns you?
If you ask the men to determine vices typical of women, all, some people as others, are capable of taking them out "from their handle".
My dear ladies, you are going to know in the following lines of female vices which succeed in pumping the blood of the veins of the men.
Purchases
Your half makes you comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Are necessary buy you at least your clothes a week?
You are happy to buy and by packets at the time of balances?
In your case it is possible to speak a vice of purchases as.
Some women think that they should restrain their passion to make purchases.
But you will say, which would resist the window-shopping of the shops of clothes to search for oneself pretty clothes and then to try them all in cabin (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most the women to buy a hobby is, it can become for the man a true Hell.
Remind of you only how much times said you to your spouse that he waits at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too big"?
"I would need to slenderize 5 kilogrammes at least - I should begin doing some sports?"
"I please you?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Yes?
You are therefore part of these women who are haunted by their appearance.
It isn't the question which you should stop taking care of yourlself but a big number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner always is complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex doesn't hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints augments and the more the women become empoisonnantes.
Odre and cleanness on the first place
It is as an infinite carousel.
Wash windows, vacuum-clean, clean soil, make the dust, clean the bathroom - and it twice a week.
You make comments to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean soil, to the children that they dirtied the washbowl, clogged up the window pane of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of job?
In case you just suffer from this fixed idea, try to have in mind that you should be necessary exaggerate nothing and that order and cleanness haven't to be on the first place in the family.
This inoffensive desire of cleanness can however spoil your relations and even family peace.
The job of sap
"Puts this tracksuit employed in the garbage can".
"You intend to put these old socks even tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to make down".
If you do on your partner this job of sap in that way several times a day, you are going really to break him down.
It is obvious that you don't think of trouble you want that everything is flawless.
Perhaps that if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have to do so much job of sap...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage but also insults against somebody are also the own of some women.
The women are particularly carried to relations and so are happy to treat subjects as whom, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps that each of us lets get away a small inoffensive persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart it is however a feature of the women.
But the worst those are who recommend, mock, even despise others and are for their circle - particularly at job in a feminine collective - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The hokeyiste Jagr attacker participated twice in the victory of Philadelphia during the match of Monday NHL on Caroline's ice and is once again at the head of the productive Czech players for competition.

"Je lui ai dit avant le correspondent à qu'il donnerait le truc du chapeau de fils".
"I smelt him".

One instant later there was a second attack of the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind purposes of Hurricanes for the quoit and introduced it to the kicker Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first pause, the local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belonged in Flyers.
In concrete terms in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth purpose.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't mean that he is the best player of the league but he is really part of three better", declared Jagr regarding the centre.
"I had never thought that I would play at the end of career with a hokeyjiste as him".
"I am really happy with it".
"I want to play on him".
"All these years in NHL the other players of the team tried to play on me, now it is my turn", added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a purpose of Tuom Ruutu and once again of Dwyer on a shooting of penalty she ends with a difference of a purpose.
Matt Read didn't move other complications aside who ended in two against one.
"Pronger performed very good attacks in our zone".
"He knocked the quoit, I gathered speed and (Read) left towards the corner the most distant from the animal box.
"I tried to hit him and I arrived at it", described the last purpose of the match of its point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia arrived with this victory at the head of Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek didn't end match with Buffalo he went out in second third because of a wound in the upper part of the body.
Candiens didn't hold facing a tested defender the advance of two butset lost after a shooting of pénalty by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec transformed none of their attacks.
It is the fact that the back line was sick which especially bothered the local entraineur rather than of dawn lost because they played match only with 5 defenders.
"It is no".
"We played match only with an experienced player, the rest they were young people".
"But there is nothing to make, it is just like that", says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement it doesn't have is enough and we couldn't resist".
"We just had to simplify game, to push the quoit out of our zone".
For it we had borders, "added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender taken part in thirtieth attack of Winnipeg and in victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax purposes of Throws, which stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How evolved the prices of trips since 1989
Until 1989 there were in Czechoslovakia only 5 state travel agencies: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies in this epoch offered trips especially in the countries of the socialist block, because trips on the West were very limited.
The Czech tourists travelled for holiday in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crimea and Black Sea), in Bulgaria, Romania (two in Black Sea) and in Hungary (Balaton).
A big exception for period from 1962 till 1972 when he was authorised to travel in Yugoslavia then regime began having an inclination as the west and trips towards Yugoslavia were very limited for the Czech tourists.
The big paradox of socialist epoch was that it nétait not allowed for the citizens of the socialist block (also for the Czechoslovakian) to travel individually even as part of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovakian citizen wanted to travel individually for example in Poland or in Soviet Union he needed a letter of invitation otherwise individual trip wasn't allowed.
Travel agencies in this epoch also gave trips on the West however it was necessary to queue up all night with a sleeping bag or to have "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even thereafter it wasn't earned yet.
The agreement for the currencies which was condition to travel on the West was refused politically wrong "people" who could travel in no way.
The Czechoslovakian currency wasn't however exchangeable and it wasn't possible to get medium financiers without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel on the West.
The Czechs spent their holiday most often in the country where there were as a result many villas and chalets which the Czechs bought and this hard habit up to now.
Trips of the Czechs since knew since 1989 a big revolution.
Although until 1989 holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria was at the farthest, the Czechs spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holiday in the countries of the whole world.
The big paradox of which we aren't aware today it is that the most popular country is Croatia where it wasn't possible to go freely until 1989 because left Yugoslavia of epoch.
The abolition of visas in the nineties of last century in the Western neighbouring countries caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria in Vienna and in Germany.
The Czechoslovakian couldn't travel for a long time by air on the West that each wanted to see an instant at least.
For example in Paris the organisations of trips made sleep the Czechs in tents in parks because our incomes didn't allow us to pay hotel or pension.
The feature typical of a trip of Czechs was in this epoch to take with one its own food preserved food, sausage, etc to economise.
Another important instant was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed to our tourists finally after dozens years it could freely buy the Western currency.
Our living standard as well as the average wage augmented what caused around year 1997 another important instant.
Thanks to an increasing request for trips travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare turns with links by air charter planes which thanks to contracts awfully reduced costs in comparison with what there was before.
At the end of the nineties of last century the Czechs had links without visas with practically most countries developed by the separate whole world HAD who later made our trips easier.
Another instant interesting post revolution in the history of tourism, when was prepared the first air charter plane towards an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
For this year as every year of the direct air charter planes take Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than 100000 Czechs who visit the exotic countries every year!
Another instant interesting for this period which represents our development post revolution came in 2008.
November 17th, 2008 HAD abolished visas for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to form a line completely in the group of the developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history passed more half of their holiday abroad (50, 3 %) and for the first time still in history spent more than 15 000 crowns per capita on holiday abroad including additional expenses. Crowns per capita.
General meeting must find his President but it risks ending by a situation without solution " a stalemate"
About 5 month already Czech football is without President and he risks that the successor to Ivan Hasek at the head of the Association of Football of the Czech Republic isn't even known after even a General meeting which must take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However it still doesn't exist agreed according to which regulations of vote it is necessary to go about things.
Without this agreement it isn't possible to begin voting for one of three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the direction of Czech football.
Hasek gave the resignation in June and in the course of the departure called her colleagues has unite and find a strong personality who will run football in future.
Only during epoch after Hasek football returned rear towards divergences between the rooms of the Association which can't come to an agreement on a common candidate.
It completely showed itself on September 16th when it was necessary to choose a new president.
The delegates of General meeting met unnecessarily in the national Home in Prague because negotiation remained blocked and it wasn't even a matter to deal of the way of electing.
He not there not had agreed on the fact of knowledge that has the right to vote in General meeting - only, it seems, for the statuary representatives or also for the civil servants invested with full powers.
In this only point there was a partial agreement since this instant with assistant also of the Office for the state and the right, according to which the representation on the basis of full power isn't possible.
Divergences always go on regarding the regulations for election.
It is too clear that the executive committee, which in his negotiation planned or extraordinary, brought nothing either in situation
Opinions on the possibilit ě of vote changed several times but the neuralgic point always remains the same.
Question is: how to go about things for the third turn not to fall in the stalemate.
"The bone of contention domiciles in following fact: another model is to go about things according to statutes or to find", determined one of three vice-presidents of the Association of football of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the envisaged model earn in the third turn that of candidates which will have received most voice in percentage within the room for which he is candidate.
The Moravia is ready according to what is told to leave so that the candidate wins who will have received the biggest percentage of voice of both rooms.
And the Czech part studies condition that the victor should have two thirds at least of percentages of voice.
"Only it would make lose then the idea of two previous turns and it would make refuse bicameral concept completely", Svoboda accepts who understands the objections of the morave part and according to whom the best would be not to change the regulations and vote according to statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even if he thinks that the regulations of elections established according to statutes favour Pelta most among all candidates.
"Je souhaite que l'on votent le maximum au selon les statuts de l'association".
"So that there aren't still absurd ideas imagined by a representative as in the course of General meetings passed", declared the owner of Victoria Plzen who is candidate for the first time and who in his accounts defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta optimistic rest.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and thinks that the candidates coopèreront in future group and in a constructive way.
"The possible skills today in European championship should tranquilize everybody".
"Football will be again on a wave of happiness and it there aure more spirit for a cooperation" adds the officer of Jablonec among three with the biggest experience in direction of football so professional as at regional level.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe situation in this agreement but unfortunately am very tense".
"It isn't a problem between the Czechs and Moraves, but there are tendencies to want to change regulations intentionally".
"It can cause a blockage again in Put together dress rehearsal".
"I hope however that healthy reason will win" Rajchl said.
There hasn't a lot of time for a common agreement to all parts.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but which can say if all direction of football will be complete for match.
The flight especially chartered in which had to travel to Podgorice between others the vice-presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, didn't take off for technical reasons and one searched a variant to take a part of the executive committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, that could take place on Wednesday, that should be decisive.
The Minister of the education of youth and of sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive parts torn within the sports association the strongest in the country and to bring them to an agreement.
In game there is a lot: a state allocation, the credibility of football and also the General meeting of the Czech Union of Sports which must determine the direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik leaves in battle for president's post because he sees no correct candidate.
If the leader of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General meeting profile of which would have answered all what he asks for a new Président de l' Association of football of the Czech Republic (AFRT) it wouldn't be put in countryside for this high function.
"If such candidate exists I support him, I struggle for him and I don't come on election."
"But in current situation it wasn't possible to find such candidate", declared Paclik to the Czech News agency (CTK).
The motivation of Paclik is to enter competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to try just d' to prevent Pelta from achieving at the head of AFRT which in priori would be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also underlines that in case he would win elections it would hold this president's post only until 2013 year envisaged for a General meeting.
He would see well in function a manager experienced and of high level but who isn't linked with the world of football.
"I discussed with people who would have profile", he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people said to me that they didn't want to be identified with Czech football at present."
"I would like to make change this picture", he added.
What, as it is said, bother Paclik especially, it is relation between regional Pelta and the Président de l' Union of football of Plzen Roman Berbr, man in the contreversée reputation who is known in the wings as lobbyst capable of having an influence on the vote of the delegates 'Put together dress rehearsal.
For Paclik it isn't allowable that Pelta occupies this president's position.
"If he won, the present state would reside and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the help of Berbr, who is a dealer of high flight, it would be even less favourable to football", Paclik proclaimed.
What still shocks him it is the fact that the name of Pelta is pronounced to it some years in the course of listenings as part of an inquiry into a corruption scandal there, for who Pelta took out without any trouble.
"Je ne sais pas quel le prestige Pelta apporterait au le football."
"And how we would be considered with the eyes of UEFA and of FIFA" having said Paclik, who declared some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the club of Plzen".
In case Paclik would triumph in the vote of Thursday, he should prove that he could collaborate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September general meeting which had ended by a failure, thinks of the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would go".
"He has big capacities"
"He would be capable of coming for example as leader of representation".
"Mais comme le directeur de l'Association il ne serait pas capable."
"I don't put the nose in what I don't know", points out Paclik who in September drew close attention when he was pronounced for the cancellation of the Committee of the referees with Ludek Macela that replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik maintains that he would be at level to run the Association.
He takes as model as his capacities to run of private business companies and that he also runs for last year the club of Plzen which celebrated with its support in May last its triumph in first division.
"I have force to make something change in the world of sports and to bring some culture there".
"I would slow down the influence of some interested groups for example with tendency to have an influence on the disciplinary Committee and of call, what what brings to improper situations", added Paclik who chache the antipathy for the leader of Sparta Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also envisage a harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee from which the power of lobby to politics of high level would allow to get for sports more money of the tax on games.
"It is one of the key points of which the new President should take care".
"If it is about the tax on games of chance as declare it the political parties, I understand their argumentation but they should also say where goes the money", he declared.
Paclik doesn't take the current link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if himself maintains that the president de l' AFRT should be "above parties".
Pelta is once again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It isn't ideal".
I don't see reason to transmit my actions of the club of Plzen to somebody if I must come back one and a half year afterwards", declared Paclik.
Pelta promised new statutes for AFRT which should put an end to the situations of stalemate.
Two days before the General meeting of the Football association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes which should put an end in future to quarrels regarding the regulations for elections.
The civil servant of Jablonec is before the meeting of Thursday in very optimistic Nymburk and thinks that the succés today of football representation should tranquilize this squabble before vote.
Pelta before the September election which didn't come true had just promised to dedicate itself to the representatives and to the getting of medium financiers if he is elected.
He decided to be candidate at the last minute just before passed General meeting and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend its vision of the direction of football and to introduce it in a broad context.
"People at all levels play football for a long time and wait that on Thursday there is a President".
"They have a feeling that it is the best instant so that somebody takes the direction of the Association", he adds, but he is linked first of all with the club of Jablonec, worked a big number of years in Sparta and in the Executive committee of the Union.
it is also for it that he has enough experiments to run Czech football.
He is persuaded that behind current problems with election an euphoria is which reigned in lépoque of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately in l" Put together June dress rehearsal of statutes were approved which weren't perfect as all noticed it".
"If there weren't all these interprétattions various we would have already had a President since September", underlines Pelta.
It is just the revision of the most important document of the civic association which took all attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take him as personal mission and am ready to take all responsibilities in case it doesn't walk".
"It is a principle without which we can't exist", added Pelta.
Then he tries hard, as it is said, not to be confronted with his adversaries.
He declared previously that he can collaborate with Jindrich Rajchl where he reconnait take into account the training in right and where he knows pertinemment that his adversary-candidate would be his first Vice-president.
He either didn't attack for a long time Tonas Paclik who on the contrary doesn't give up criticising Pelta.
"He evolves in football for one year and has already had some succés."
"His attacks weren't however the most honourable and surprised many people in the course of the countryside."
"It is also for it that some people have doubts now about his character", declared Pelta at his adversary but residence, he says, faithful to proclamations which he made in September.
His strongest weapon is according to shining his knowledge of football from the competitions of the lowest level up to the national réprésentation.
It should be a vitirne of football.
"And I would also try hard to end all business which begins with that of Bohémians or the continuation of the scandal of corruption."
"I would enter negotiations immediately with the public sector and private so that we could get enough money for all football", declared to the Czech News agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his nomination at the head of football would bring no persons' change.
"I should make acquaintance with all employees", he declared to Strahov where reigns comprehensible one nervousness since he not there no direction.
Although there is catastrophic scénarii envisaged with General meeting, he thinks that the delegates will go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is the single point of dissension on the way of voting in the third turn we will succeed in surpassing it".
"Football needs credibility and he will get it only when there will be at the head a new leader", as declares it in an optimistic way Pelta two days before probably decisive day for the career of civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under the direction AFRT would begin working hard
"If the current Vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected new Président de l' Association of football of the Czech Republic in l" general meeting of Thursday it wouldn't please big number of people, he parried.
Rajchl promises however that in case he would be elected they will begin working hard.
He wants systematic changes and to return the members of the Executive committee is responsible for different domains of football.
He also promised to regulate affair Bohémians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money in football and to continue the job begun by the precursor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety".
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through the representatives, through professional football and through competitive football for youth."
"But I don't say that I will make all that alone" Rajchl in a maintenance for CTK said.
"I am a player of team and want to distribute competences within the Executive committee so that each of the members takes care of a determined domain."
"Et je distribuerai des les missions difficiles versent que le football font face à grand pas un demi-cadratin avant".
"Many people won't be happy because it will be a question of beginning working hard rather than to criticise others" he added.
He mentioned, as it is said, that he wouldn't imagine as candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"Regarding me, they know that I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it is worth the effort and if I will have people behind me who will continuously put a spoke in the wheel to me and issue doubts on each of my actions", explaining why he hesitated.
"Many people however said to me that I shouldn't abandon because they would also abandon".
"Cest a confidence which I can't betray", he says.
What motivates him, as it is said, also is to continue the job begun with Hasek.
"Since this two last years there was a big de facto job and I don't want to drop it".
"There are processes which were thrown which will have consequences over the years and I wouldn't like that somebody stops them.', he declared with fear that in case of the election of Miroslav Pelta situation within the Union returns as she was before Hasek.
"I believe in a systematic job and it is a thing which Mirek Pelta can't make".
"Behind him people are who fairaient of football so that he would be only for those who were chosen".
"It is possible to reproach me for some things but surely for no supporter quelq' one".
"I try hard to be objective".
"I want to play football for all because everybody will be happy with it not only those who were chosen
And he confirms again that he would be only a President for Czechia.
"And if there is who say the opposite, I am ready to make the maximum for the Moravia".
"For example, it is the time to envisage that the second division is divided into two parts the one Czech and the other morave whose victors would meet in first division."
"There wouldn't be situation as currently with only three team moraves in division because problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Club of Plzen, entered competition for the post of President, Rajchl can't assess his own chances to win.
"I permanently smell a support of the Czech Chamber which elected me its Vice - president and knows that with me there will be succés", declared Rajchl who envisages among the succés futures to economise dozens million crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of contracts with televisions and on law on games.
He says on the contrary that the fact that the Association isn't joined is a common error to all.
While he says regarding Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate who has what to give in football.
"Nobody can call into question in Plzen only he did this year a superb job".
"If he was elected he would go on surely in what was begun with Hasek and wouldn't make notable change among the persons in Committees."
"He wouldn't like to spoil his succés" said Rajchl who has assessed his rivals.
The nicest swimming pools of Europe
A jump in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in optics of UFO, splendid swimming pools of Budapest: Who travels across Europe is possible live its blue miracle - and having turned the city or made a long promenade is possible let rest the legs made tired in baths of soda water.
A book shows in which basin of swimming they can experience most ease.
When Iris Meder went to research trip during 18 last months, there is an object which shouldn't miss in its luggage: the swimsuit.
Spread on the back in the water, she noticed the artistically disposed domes, and swam contrary to marbles Putten who waited for her on the other side of the swimming pool and almost admired Art nouveau meticulously restored these converted swimming pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased him, she noted in her book without delay all details worthy of interest on the type of building and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were polled in that way by the historian of architecture Meder and her introduced them in his already published book: "Badefreuden (Joy of the Bath". Covered swimming pools local elections of Münich, historical palaces of bath in the black forest, "concrete buildings Hardcore" in Taunus.
She drove her "trips in the most exceptional baths of the Central Europe" in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited respectively places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have interest for sports but ell a lot feels attracted to the water in a completely different way.
It is annoying that the supporters of swimming have to content themselves with considering blue tiles and make the best of the stench of the chloride bleach while joggers sniffs some perfume bewitching forests of spruce or be able to listen to the twitter of cheerful birds of the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must always in fact be so ugly" the Viennese said.
"I began therefore a collection of nice baths."
The surface of the water reinforces architecture doubly
A diving in a swimming pool and volatile oils of sauna - factor of ease in the rooms of swimming are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the master-builders would have given a little more trouble, rooms to be swum could be true one delight for eyes: "Instead of a floor there is a surface of water in the rooms of swimming."
"She is on the one hand transparent, but reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the building entirely."
All surfaces come optiquement in a double way: high arches, multicoloured tiles, ski jumps.
The volume of picture of small format " Badefreuden " made a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and of culture on the oasis of historical ease - it indeed gives desire to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her researches in Hungary.
Next to the baths of ease splendid as the 100-year-old bath Széchenyi in Budapest, it found waters containing some nitrate in a natural cavern in the karst (bath of cavern in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths with which basins are filled with water containing some ammonia and (Városi Termálfürd ö in Jászberény) and being in a building in the form of bottle.
On the contrary, the heated swimming pools open-air from Switzerland and from Austria give spectacular views. While of a roof of the bath of Zürich there is all city in his/her opinion, it is possible to admire snowy Arlberg from an external swimming pool of St Anton: The bath Turkish is provided with a window from which it is possible to notice animation on the ski-track.
Perhaps the conception of the most extraordinary swimming pool waits for the swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal resembles an UFO which has just landed on the Alps.
In winter, from the steam rises of three opened sets, while in the background the mountains of l' Ötztal skyward rise.
Alhambra in the black forest
the smell of the chloride bleach doesn't emanate from all swimming pools of the collection Meder.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, of l' Á rpád-spa in Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a spa health.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing some hydrogen of carbon which is almost black and its silt glues you together on the skin as soon as you are allowed to slip into the swimming pool - a special experience of spa.
During its search of nice swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointment: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free external swimming pool and open-air of Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded ground.
The bath conceived by the architèque Of š a year Jurkovic in 1902 was meantime closed.
By having a quick look by the window of the building-art nouveau in rouge-blanc-jaune, she noticed the development of the bad grasses between tiles.
She noticed an opposite effect in a delightful swimming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of thermal baths of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three stages; it is possible to discover not only neo-Roman elements which go out since his conception in 1844 but another room maure in style Alhambra which was added to him in 1900.
Since its careful modernisation of 1995, the thermal palace remains the favourite bath of the expert in swimming pool, Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from Schwarzwald.
"It is already a nice output that of to melt so different styles of building in such a tremendous unit", says Meder.
With such palace, the diving in the thermal swimming pool is obviously only a question minor.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines speculation in details on material first ones
Of Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on raw materials?
According to information of SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann made responsible a working party for searching consequences of speculation for the poor people of the world.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84 % Germans find unacceptable that banks speculate about raw materials as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of the questioned persons demand even that the German bank and other institutes of credit abort this avenue of business because it augments problems of the poorest of the world.
It is the result of an inquiry Forsa on order of the organisation of the consumers Foodwatch.
Study leans on a report introduced by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann underlines in this article that the speculation of Stock Markets on total raw materials, pushes prices from above and that banks share a complicity in worldwide famine.
The countryside of consumers' protection is in a line in concrete terms against the leader of Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
The speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect the traders against the fluctuations of prices.
But the majority of the experts share opinion meantime that the gamblers broke loose from offer and request - and are of benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from American rivals: He promised to investiguer reproaches and says, "no affair is worth putting into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information of ONLINE SPIEGEL an international working party examine currently the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
Examination must be ended before end of year, then the results of the directorate of Deutsche Bank must be introduced - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the leader of the Bank will point consequences out to be drawn.
He could result from it a reduction of the market of raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann constructs the Picture
The leader of Foodwatch Thilo Bode greeted news, but at the same time confirmed his critics towards the financial sector: "The speculation on the increase in prices of foodstuffs shows in a particularly draconian way, to what extent the today's banks harm general interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be today particularly under obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must abolish all investments of the wallet, for which some money was invested on food speculations" Bode declared.
"It matters not much, for mister Ackermann, if it is a matter of hungry people or if the reputation of Deutsche Bank is in game."
The realisation of Ackermann can seem first glance surprising, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to introduce a perfect picture, some months before leaving the job.
Deutsche Bank made announce on Monday that the head of government of Administration will change nothing in what is envisaged within the Directorate.
Ll could improve the brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculations.
And about possible losses, he has hardly to care about it - his successor will be concerned about it.
One of two would cancel investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch s'efforce de maintenir une le fort pression sur le Directeur.
Until now more than 30 000 internauts have already participated in the countryside of the organisation.
Bode published opinion poll on Tuesday, with which on November 7th and 8th the Institute Forsa performed questionnaires to 1001 persons.
Just eleven for one hundred found it justifies that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on the prices of foodstuff are made.
Many clients of the bank would also draw personal consequences if they learnt that their bank participates in such operations: one of two would cancel, further to opinion poll, all investments for which some money is injected into speculations on raw materials.
43 for one hundred would disadvise such bank in the circle, 49 % answered that they would think about the termination of their count to change d" banking establishment.
21th home in Vienna
The Pavilion which moved
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with tops, bottoms and Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for worldwide exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 won prices, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty then was in ruin.
Currently he is again opened and serves as home of exhibition.
If they get enthusiastic about an architecture of modern postwar years, about its clear forms, its glassy sheds, its audacious and lively paces and its new building materials which are typical of belief towards technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the world fair of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavilion of Schwanzer received in the past the "Grand prix of Architecture" for its steel and glassy, light and hanging building.
The building is considered until our days to be an important stage in contemporary architecture.
He returned such famous architects, as he also constructed the Pavilion for following Austrian world fair.
With her legendary home in four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent building in the form of bowl in Munich, he finally became famous at international level in 1973.
Its plan of pavilion as temporary building had been displayed after world fair in the Garden Swiss to the railway station of the south of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically or technically adapted for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, therefore no good environment.
However it was used so for a long time, jusqu "in what contemporary art receives a new building to Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and more and more became run-down.
Currently the architect Adolf Krischanitz transformed the Pavilion, he has the name now of "Home of the 21th century" and will be in future used as museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere opened, to which the home belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky break from any point of view.
New departure was completed successfully by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new head in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, promoted a historian of art to a considerable career between other one in the youth of artistic skater, later to Sotheby' s, in the museum Guggenheim and as founder head of the museum of the modern art of Salzbourg, she completed successfully particularly jobs of transformation to the politicians and of the protection of monuments, she got public funds and sponsorship private and established working.
Except contemporary art, the writings of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba foundation of which has the same name were displayed there, a coffee and a bookshop are there, and an office must be constructed there.
Strict surveillance, tight budget
For realisation Krischanitz the ideal interpreter was therefore.
Not only because he had transformed and enlarged with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and because he had earned competition, but because he had studied to the technical University of Vienna and because for him the pavilion was " an extremely important place " place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the plan of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness further to its displacement in Vienna and all over its change of use.
During current transformations, there were big problems: l "building was "a chasm in energy", says Krischanitz.
The profiles of windows of the glassy facades were changed, of the insulating glass reinforced in glass fibers was put down and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The girders of the thermal bridges were reinforced or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two basements made place in new working, a panel of light sieved between the home and the road assures lighting, a bridge drives to the entrance - it is almost a new building, but always the light Pavilion Schwanzer.
The external doors of origins stayed, the home is painted in a shade protection against the rust of red-brown colour.
And the cinema hall is even exactly identical to the fact that it was in the past.
And all that under narrow surveillance of the competent authorities for monuments and with a tight budget.
"Often materials which are good and not very expensive must be found, and that also please the service of protection monuments", says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw soil in basement.
In spite of all pressures, problems and transformations, l "building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "who came from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a history typical of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the bad place" and wants nonetheless "to awaken good conscience".
But in that case the Home of the 21th century isn't in the bad place, because if it is about a lucky break of urban building: around the Garden Swiss the "district of the central railway station" very newly envisaged, with offices and flats just stands.
And another lucky break is perhaps going to occur: the Home of the 21th century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary arts centre, and as he tells himself, it already negotiates with the city to get a site close to the Garden Swiss.
Bahn plans a fixed rate winter crisis in millions.
The society of railways worked out a plan-crisis, which aims at avoiding accidents of train in winter.
The number of wage earners should double.
It costs millions.
In battle against accidents of train linked to winter season and delays, the society of railways " Deutsche Bahn " will spend in this respect more than 70 additional millions this year.
The daily " Bild "-Zeitung brought back in anticipation by invoking an internal plan-crisis to the group, that investments of about a total 300 million euro would be envisaged until 2015.
It should allow a better availability of vehicles and of railway network also in the case of extreme bad weather.
The number of internal and external wage earners for the clearing of snow of the railway installations and of quays should between other one double and pass to 16.000 persons.
Objective is to clear out the quays of the snow and of the ice till the beginning of service stage and 90 for hundred apparatus of way necessary for service within four-five hours.
Two months ago the Stationmaster Rüdiger Grube warned government and industry during a summit conference of accidents of trains happened also this winter.
Last winter the society of railways had a tremendous number of problems as the transport d" users, because it misses between other one of reservations in case of difficult meteorological conditions.
That's how many new regional trains wait many years for a permission on behalf of the Ministry of railways.
Besides, he is late in the delivery of trains ICE there.
The society of railway has many years what to make, given that she must make prove the axles of trains ICE distinctly more often to the workshop, after a break of axles takes place on ICE in the central railway station of Cologne.
The German " Deutsche Bank " bank pays millions of penalties in USA.
After the affair of the leader Josef Ackermann there is the new in USA: the German " Deutsche Bank " bank must pay a fine s "raising in millions.
As though the problems of Deutsche Bank weren't already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector catches it in more in USA: the institute of Frankfurt pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euro), to regulate a disagreement because of the bankruptcy of five big co-operative banks during financial crisis.
It is about the sale of documents of mortgage.
The regulator of financial markets NCUA carries to the big banks the whole series of accusations, and it to have encourage the co-operative banks to make wrong promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they would have minimised risks.
These documents lost a tremendous number of value in the course of financial crisis and drew banks away downwards.
"We are satisfied, to have been able to find a solution on this subject, without parts starting a procedure in the court", said an interlocutor of Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank admitted no error in comparison.
It is valid also for Citigroup, who got involved in a payment of a 20,5 million dollar sum.
The president of NCUA Debbie Matz received concessions of both banking establishments.
National Credit Administration union (NCUA) responsible for co-operative banks of USA and it intervenes in case of bankruptcy, to protect the stores of customers.
NCUA tries to repair incurred damage by several thousand million dollars.
Comparisons concluded now are the first ones in their type.
The regulator also got other big banks from part and in summer it allocated before the court JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As regards the question of the documents of mortgage it is about "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The houses of credit are at the root of it.
When the American property bubble burst in 2007, This was fatal for a big number of banking societies.
In September, 2008, at the top of financial crisis, the bank of investment of USA LEHMAN BROTHERS collapsed.
Even if events already date from some years, at present it is blowing on the American banks a wind of storm.
The investors and the authorities of surveillance began many appeals to get repairing or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) launched the biggest wave of complaints.
She reproaches 18 big international banks, both financiers of real estate d "state Americans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of s" to be favoured in kind during business of mortgages about 200 thousand million dollars.
Deutsche Bank must also deposit an appeal to FHFA, it is here about several operations of a 14,2 thousand million dollar sum for 2005s in 2007.
The authorities of surveillance ask, that Frankfurter answers "substantial losses" but however without naming a definite sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected requests as being unjustified and declares to want to defend itself.
Le WARREN Buffett augmente de 10 personnes chez IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests colossal sums in the firm TI of IBM.
Since March, he bought actions for a more than ten thousand million dollar value.
Until then the big American investor Warren Buffett explains not to invest continuously in computer firms TI, in view of the fact that l "long-term evolution of societies let appear only bad forecasts.
He however read the reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He already had to understand much more early that IBM offers especially services and computer systems for the sectors TI of other firms.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered to be knight's attack in the world of finance.
As a result activity TI IBM allows itself right to be currently called "Mister IBM".
Because Buffett has revealed in l "economic programme CNBC today, that he has bought actions IBM since March worth 10,7 thousand million dollars.
Its society holding company of investment Berkshire Hathaway so became a major shareholder of IBM with a part of 5,5 for one hundred.
Buffett said that IBM has ever known nothing about this commitment until now.
He congratulated the direction, which even during economic crisis had assured the reasonable benefits.
"You made a great work", said Buffett strategically.
IBM bets since some time on profitable services TI in so much qu" working of the accounting centres.
The pioneer of the computer, old of more than 100 years, gives as well Software package and consultation as very competitive adding machines of firm.
Buffett had until now avoided rather the firms of technology.
He says that he invests only in the firms business of which he includes.
But on the contrary Buffett attacks rather the railway frêt, the producers of lubricants or of machines.
His Berkshire Hathaway holding company has about 80 subsidiaries as well as parts to the whole series of big groups as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the ex Rück Munich.
This 81-year-old octogenarian had taken back in the sixties" the small enterprise of textile industry Berkshire Hathaway and established it at the rank of one of the most prestigious worldwide firms, thanks to clever investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
It is for it that it is a face worship for many investors of the whole world.
Its almost infallible sense to earn some money was worth it the nickname of "oracle d' Omaha".
After the announcement of the investment of Buffett actions IBM augmented by one for one hundred in the grant.
"Big Blue", such as is also called IBM, has a stock exchange value of a more than 220 thousand million dollar total and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious firms of technology in the world.
Chez Microsoft, dit Buffett, il ne veut pas y participer.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
Threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "cell of Zwickauer" Turkish media doubts the state of German right.
A newspaper speaks even about a "bloody ideology", which would come back to life currently.
The assassinations of eight Turkish nationals and of a Greek small enterprise in 2000s in 2006 had an extremist context.
Further to this news, Turkey as well as germano-Turkish population reacts with fright and concern.
Because for many germano-Turkish the spectre that they thought dead for a long time does again its appearance: since the incendiary assassination attempts of Mölln in November, 1992 and in Solingen in May, 1993, there was no more violence comparable with this extremist context of right against the Turks.
That there is a xenophobia in Germany, it was however a matter of it never.
The extremist network of right which was discerned reveals however proportions the dimension of which is far from being foreseeable.
"It is a return to the bloody ideology", "Such was the title of publication on Internet of the Turkish daily " Haberturk ".
The newspaper " Sabah " underlines on the other hand that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of Constitution, and gets worried due to the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the quagmire of extreme right.
It is of a reasoned way that reacted the Turkish community in Germany: she called this weekend to a silent commemoration to the victims of racial violence in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
It is only two weeks before only the Turkish community of Berlin and politics German and Turkish had thought of a ceremony of the fiftieth birthday of the agreement of germano-Turkish recruitment.
It is with joyful colours that co-habitation had been staged, representing a history of success.
The reports of some Turkish media make the effect of a slap in the face: "the present of Germany for the fiftieth birthday" such is the title of an article in the Turkish platform " Haber X ", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Also the German publication of "Hürriyet" doesn't hesitate to draw univocal conditions.
"this begins stinking", Such is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He underlines there that people would have been assassinated, would have paid taxes and would have brought by their job a contribution important for the reconstruction of Germany.
The action of the police was received in a very critical way on the germano-Turkish forums and these had later discussed the success of their researches.
Why he already didn't come to mind much more early of German authorities to do researches in some suspicious circles of extreme right, the authors are surprised.
More of one proves to be ready at least for one medium rhetorics or even drastic: "If affair continues being dashed off, the migrants will have nothing else than self-defence and weaponry".
"this will be well the best self-defence".
"The internal peace in Germany depends strongly on the quality of information and on pertinence of the punishment of the whole network", writes "Selen".
What it means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the assassination attempts of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties explained well.
The photo of ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed more apparently to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, in what mistrust and distance by acts of violence could result.
Assassination attempts however whet feeling of to us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat errors of past
In the past it is especially the failure of German politics after the assassination attempts about which the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegramme of condolences to the Turkish Head of state, was represented to funeral in Cologne by its minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in epoch in its speech, how much taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As though the value of a man could be assessed on the sum of its tax burdens.
The current report of Turkish media shows one more time how much the mistrust so far Germano-turcs is deep towards l "state of local right from that time.
Besides efforts of a more ample elucidation and reappraisal of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, a clear message is this time necessary.
The bank with scandal of the lake of Zürich
The most adventurous Bank of Europe isn't in Italy or in France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in financial crisis and skates meantime from a crisis to the other one.
It is a German who must run now.
It isn't indeed what Axel Weber s "was imagined.
After his spectacular departure of the head of Bundesbank; they knew in July, when he would occupy in 2013 an almost so spectacular post: Head of government of Administration of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and profitable career.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, greeted; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently got solidity and got observations of kind on the future colleagues.
"L'UBS le Turnaround réussi".
"I am delighted with the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And however, from September it was clear that everything is going to change.
A trader of titles of UBS in London had diverted all systems of security of the Bank and singed about 1,7 thousand million euro.
The leader of the directorate of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
of the Head of government of administration of UBS is considered since as suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber come back finally?
We have already learnt that Weber can be recommended of the bank from February, 2012.
And he will take back the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as announced it the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He isn't banker, much more professor d "economy and Bank president, and he would indeed have needed a period of adaptation.
All at once he takes responsibility then for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again more than it deserved title for a long time of "the biggest bank with scandal of Europe".
Indeed, UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest administrator of assets of the world, and of other one, she skates many years from a scandal to the other one.
Nothing, it seems, doesn't spare such a proud Swiss bank.
It began during financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS had a very good reputation.
The picture of the Swiss administrator of assets, silent and solid, but also shrewd, her had combined him with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become, in the field of the banking investment, a very big bank.
Therefore UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with 1,6 thousand million dollars more money coming from easy customers than quite other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as bank of investment in the league of the biggest banks of the world.
It made impression.
The ancient banker grunt Geiger and later professor of bank during long years in Zurich tells: "I always took UBS as model of good bank in front of my students."
"In current optics, they wonder: how would I have simply been able to make a mistake in this point?"
He deeply made a mistake.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something didn't turn circle in UBS.
In the middle of the year the president Peter Wuffli left in a surprising way, who was considered until then to be a high intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
Some months later they sensed for which reasons he had left.
The division of the bank had singed sub-bonus with documents and has to give up hope of thousand millions.
To back it up, UBS announced an increase in capital of a 13 thousand million franc sum and gave up hope over.
For it she really found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a bottom of non-transparent Asiatic state coming from Singapore and a bottom of Arab state, which had passed under silence, to the point where its name has been even never learnt.
It n "was however that the first blow.
In April, 2008 it was got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses amounting to thousand millions, the head of government of administration Marcel Ospel, who was still in 2006 the second directorate best paid by Switzerland, left.
In October, 2008 disaster followed: UBS was, considering the errors of investment, in financial crisis before bankruptcy and must be saved by the State.
The national bank bought back in UBS the dozens thousand million problematic titles, the Swiss Confederation gave six thousand million francs for convertible obligations in actions, for which she could become co-owner of the bank.
All Switzerland was shaken - because she noted to what extent it can be dramatic for a small country, to shelter such big banks.
Finally, the total of the balance sheet of UBS 2007 s "has raised for more than five times the economic performances of Switzerland (to see graphic).
"We couldn't save UBS once again", says the researcher of banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster he was in order of the second.
Already some months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax disagreement with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy customers, who had defrauded the tax office perhaps with the help of the Bank.
Besides, it accepted a 780 million dollar payment - in refund of unjustified benefits coming from these operations with an increased fine.
So UBS more or less published that she had helped in tax fraud.
At the same time she lost something that was always its capital in competition with the rich clients: the prestige of discretion.
After scandal Swiss bank confidentiality wasn't any more the same.
He was in order of the withdrawal of the leader of the directorate and of the head of government of administration.
And of the exodus of the money of the clients.
So the bank had lost its credibility in some months in both main business sectors: the banking investment because of bad speculations and the management of assets because of the assistant to tax fraud.
And, as there was a little a return to peace, and as it was thought, that UBS would take out, it was in order of this traders' unhappy history of title: the single trader of title singes 1,7 thousand million euro, before the bank realises that something didn't turn circle.
And they publish: with the management of risks in bank of investment it doesn't always seem to work.
"With case Adoboli, it was possible to note that the workmanship of risks in too little changing", says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finances in the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
Also the financial director of a big German bank is sure there: "the problem of UBS is that she has no workmanship of risks in hand."
However it was exactly about the idea of caution, with which the Swiss bankers had taken for a long time their function, that to become security guard of the big destiny of the world: no surplus big risks, but security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of an unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are it for a particularly noble chocolate.
The power station of UBS in Zurich goes still hand in hand with the solid plate of the private Swiss bank - she is only a little bigger.
Already situation is classical.
The Bank has its seat in the central railway station of Zurich, which drives directly the central railway station to the lake of Zurich, which is encircled by the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains itself.
Buildings are here prestigious, the rents of shops appear among the highest of Europe.
The jewellers as Tiffany' s, they are found here between the shops of Swiss traditions just as those of confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss bankers domiciled here: of the national bank by way of the palace of Credit Switzerland up to private elitist banks as Julius Bär.
They arrive in the entrance hall of UBS by a heavy door.
Indoors, walls are dressed in marble, owing thick leather chairs, and next to the logo of the bank, a big tag for "safe" are.
UBS knows what the client searches here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank some day moved aside from the market - or betrayed two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Switzerland, as the leader of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He préfèrerait not to read his name in the newspaper, finally as all Swiss bankers he is also doing business with two big banks.
UBS would have become very too big, be him - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxon would besides have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more there to say.
"And even if, they fitted for a long time to the morals of the Anglo-Saxon."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon bank of investment which changed UBS, she made high benefits and then breaking up: no European financial establishment lost so much money in the jungle of sub-bonus as big Swiss bank.
L'évaluation de catastrophe de La devenue apparente le 15 2008 Octobre.
"On Wednesday the governmental alliance of the small country to seven million inhabitants undertook the biggest operation of rescue in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of UBS".
With up to 68 thousand million francs about, that is 45 thousand million euro, the politicians agreed to save from bankruptcy the big bank.
How could it arrive?
If they speak with Swiss bankers, they see problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June, 1998 two three big Swiss banks concluded together a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too big for small Switzerland - and recorded an increase continuously.
What helped, it is that both prédécesseuses banks different from UBS supplemented: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as strong point the management of assets in Zurich and poorer one, but certainly already more strongly internationalised.
Suddenly, the international banks of investment had favourably access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to the ascent of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 till 2007 Leader of the group UBS, and Marcel Ospel, in the past head of government of administration.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel constituted a team of dream", says the researcher of banks, grunts Geiger.
"Wuffli, the big modest intellectual, who agrees there very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who elbowed in up to the summit with the training of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted jusqu "at the end in Wuffli.
And wuffli would have probably made at the end a decisive error: "He thought that his models were reality", says Geiger.
"It is a tragic fall."
Tragedy, perhaps.
A thing is clear: exuberance arrived before fall.
The personnel of UBS remembers apparently meetings of the leaders in the course of which the leader of the group Wuffli always pronounced the same word of order: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful bank of investment of the planet.
She ordered "League Tables" classifications, who researched in this epoch the success of banks.
Afterwards all UBS wanted to go up very above.
Some stages have already succeeded in him.
In affair of currencies and of transactions of securities she played a very important role.
The advisers of firm, who had the responsibility for it, underlined a weakness however: in international operations of interests, in banking jargon " Fixed Income ", there would be a huge difference in comparison with the biggest banks.
UBS would have lacunas at the level of the American products of mortgages.
To fill up this lacuna, UBS belongs threw in an adventure, which almost cost him life.
Made thirsty by growth, it is as well the bank itself that a bottom of management created before her in investments sub-prevails over Americans who invested.
She was transformed into a massive machine which wrapped and got the documents of value based on the American mortgage loans - but that also kept risks.
Even when other banks tried for a long time to go down.
"Still in the course of summer, 2007, while the market of American real estate was blazing, UBS bought there", says Geiger, the banking expert.
More euphoria is big more fall is violent.
A manager after other one had to leave, when to put an end to tries proved to be more difficult than they thought.
Posts to UBS became éjectables and are until now bancaux.
The one who runs the big bank has a quasi impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested models of firm disappeared.
The researcher of bank, Geiger already has an idea: put an end to the bank of investment, concentration in the management of property, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't want to go (yet) so far.
But the bank of investment must atrophy vigorously, as much as it is clear jusqu "currently.
Next Thursday the leader of bank Sergio Ermotti wants to introduce in the world his future strategy.
51-year-old Italo-suisse was only assumed be in transitional title when the bank parted with astonishment from its precursor Grübel.
Meantime, he was obvious: he must lead permanently the business of UBS, announced on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermotti wants to bring back the bank of investment to the state of progress of the middle of 1990s.
He cancels 3500 jobs.
Mais ça ne suffira pas.
UBS needs a vision.
Whom is she?
With what does she want to make money?
These are questions qu" Axel Weber indeed already settled.
He says publicly until now only that he is going to search a flat with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

The clever crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered to be "problem of birds °" But the experts maintain that these very clever animals aren't allowed to dispel cities any more for a long time.
Some people like them, some others want to get rid of it of them too quickly that possible. The crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the inhabitants increase because of dirtiness and of noise of the animals.
An antidote doubles "°problème of birds" am not still within sight.
During the ostfriesisch first symposium on the crows, the experts said that it isn't possible any more to dispel the rooks of cities.
The experts of all Germany discussed possible solutions.
They search alternatives in cities
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of the particularly protected rooks: The use of chemicals in agriculture destroys more and more the traditional life spaces.
Hunt, development and butchery of typical trees of brooding returned difficult life to birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are big colonies with more than 600 couples of brooding in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among who Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial plan had earned negative advertisings because of massacre of the crows in this region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their slaughter with bludgeons particularly violent.
"Normal expulsion, outsting, is of no use", determined the planning of the city and of the landscape of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with the aid of the water under pressure or to cut trees, produced often by undesirable consequences, said the expert of environment Manfred Kaiser de Lahr to Bade-Wurtemberg.
"The animals move away, the big colonies become divided and they scatter in other places."
L "outsting is imaginable only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We think we are made to live with them, we can't exterminate them any more."
Problem isn't allowed to solve in cities without the inclusion of periphery, according to the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner de Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the outsting of the animals in an aversif conditioning and of importunate offer, to allow them to re-become established elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens canvassed "panels of information instead of chain saws" to establish completely different relations with: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded Ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif of baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road panels informing about the life of these very clever rooks.
This plan was meantime adopted by the tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about criticism regarding the noise caused by birds: "Here is a big number of communication, these birds have a lot to tell themselves".
Intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Rooks use working instruments not only to arrive at a culinary delight but they fabricate their tools as working instruments themselves.
Éthologistes of the university of Cambridge tested four rooks recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds arrives.
In an experience, birds quickly learnt that they had to make collapse a scaffolding with stones to reach a larva so.
Without a lot of training, they admitted déterminément that a stone had to have some size and form to make collapse the deck.
In a second trial, the astute crows then had to resolve a stockier problem.
In a cylinder put vertically, the researchers had put a small bucket with a larva.
Birds couldn't attain their booty with their beak.
However, the researchers had put the pieces of iron thread in their disposition.
Every four animals formed a hook with the help of which they caught the small bucket of the small conduit.
Three of four rooks they succeed even from the beginning.

L'abattage de masse le personnel
The new book of Peter Englund gives depth and generosity. Called "The Beauty and the Sorrow: Year Intimate History of the First World War" (beauty and grief: an intimate story of the First World war), it starts with a long list of characters which grips you the heart.
An advice to begin: tear this page carefully and make your mark-page there.
You will learn to know these persons in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in the course of these some instants when, as one of his men or women, you will be flustered and despaired in the fog of war.
Peter Englund is a historian and a Swedish journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, who issues the Nobel prize of literature.
He wrote here an outstanding book which he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-history."
He includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; no ambassador and debate on strategies and equipment are found.
It isn't so much a book on what there happened, he explains, that a "book describing what it could resemble". "Feelings, impressions, experiments and moods are found there."
"Beauty and grief" sums up experiments in times of war of 20 men and more or less ordinary women, on both sides of war, young schoolgirls and botanists in escaladeurs, by way of doctors, ambulance drivers and sellers.
Some some people will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war. Some people will lose members, will become mad or will die.
Their lives wobble here as the candles of a church: while some go out, it is relit of new.
The book of Peter Englund moves away from traditional books of history.
He brings a denial in the idea according to which the First World war comes down only by the terrible war of trenches on the Western forehead.
" Beauty and grief" described skilfully by other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the oriental forehead, Mésopotamie and oriental Africa.
The present soldiers in this book are under beehives; the one passes Christmas in Égypte under pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War pervades the lives of these persons such a natural disaster, such a hurricane Katrina who stinks of the cordite.
When cannon shots blare in the distance, and that you are a stay-at-home mother, do you stay or do you run away?
Who will come in any case?
Almost nobody can understand what there happened, nor even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts was expanded by assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspirationnistes theories, of dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and grief" follows by individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English childminder within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the fleet of German open sea.
Their stories are mainly drawn of memo, letters and other already published documents.
Versions of their lives can be terrible or exciting, but are more preserved thanks to the accumulation of small instants and insulated details.
Most approach deprivation and capacity to take out.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, written Peter Englund: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Coffee of replacement, wrong aluminium, rubber simulation, paper gauzes, wooden buttons."
He continues on the food of replacement in Germany.
It describes some "meat made by cooked rice crushed in some grease of sheep (and finished with a wrong wooden bone); the tobacco fabricated with dry roots and of the dried skin of potato; soles of wooden shoes."
He maintains that "837 allowed meats of substitution are recorded in the production of sausages. Also 511 coffees of substitution are found."
Some stories approach honour and courage.
An American admits his own impulse towards savageness and declares regarding war: "You have a feeling that after all, it is for what the men were intended, rather than to sit down in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than to pretend that such varnish is synonymous with civilisation, and that there is no barbarian behind your starched shirt and cloutée.
Conversely, a British soldier accomplishes that he risks extremely dying, and that nobody will point him out or pay attention to it.
"When they are relinquished to sacrifice themselves, they hope to have a public" he writes.
It is unfortunately rather comparable to "a condemned man choked secretly".
Other observations concern the decline of old Europe and new types of terror.
"Conflict becomes more and more a history of economic competition" written Peter Englund, "a war between plants."
He grabs the arrival of what he calls "a new kind within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the murderer of mass well articulated and persuaded idéologiquement, in well sharpened clothes, who carries his butchery out sitting down behind a bar."
People act in an unexpected way; one are found so much basic behaviours as heroism.
Peter Englund speaks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal illness at prostitutes to avoid service in the forehead.
"The most ridiculous expression in trade is found of could due to the gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and s" display over sexual organs in the hope of finishing in the hospital", he writes.
"Having most despaired what is applied it on eyes, what is translated by a lifelong blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to its task of humanity.
In dozens short stages, he grabs the way war "launched exclusively uncontrollable force: an extreme nationalism, a social revolution, a dislike for religion."
People begin wondering why their leaders wage them a war.
The best works treating the First World war are often indirect, as "Great War and Modern Memory" (First World War and modern memory) of Paul Fussel, or "On the West to nothing new", Erich Maria Remarque, rather than suits.
The work of Peter Englund is a not very conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most oppressive that I read in a work not - fictionnelle.
I won't reveal her.
But it is as though he had come into sight from his book, grabbed this page with your hands where appears persons' list and burnt with a match.
After a first mistake, a thoroughly planned operation
Hundreds of policemen were involved, some carrying helmets antiriot.
The night from Monday till Tuesday was chosen because the park Zuccotti would be the emptiest.
Operation remained secret of all except some officers high put as well as others informed from the beginning than they are going to undertake exercise.
The captain Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of operation, its presence underlining risks and challenges for the department of Police.
There couldn't be repetitions d "episodes these last weeks, as the use of gas adds pepper against demonstrators, who went against the regulations of the department and procreated a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
Operation aiming at cleaning the park Zuccotti of his demonstrators was displayed after two weeks of planning and training.
The policemen s "were prepared by noticing the holding of occupations in other cities.
A key exercise was organised on l "island of Randall, with the aim of operation in the park Zuccotti.
The policemen receive a better training against riots - to anti-terror measures which consist in moving fast a big number of policemen - to concentrate on the district of Lower Manhattan.
The last session of training took place on Monday evening, on the side of Manhattan of East River.
Orders given to move in the park reached last minute, declared a regular, referring to operation as in a simple financial year ".
" Some policemen whom I know and who were called didn't know that they would go to the park Zuccotti", declared the person under anonymity.
"The only ones to know that they would go are at the top of the hierarchy of the department of Police there."
The city could keep a lesson, where from the secret of operation.
On October 14th of this year, policemen wanted to clean the park but grew back by hundreds of demonstrators informed about plans.
The operation of Tuesday implicated officers of various units of Police, among which operational force of all district - dozens officers used to the particularly criminal districts.
Mr Kelly declared that many persons went and came in the park during day, like migrants. One o'clock was therefore an advantageous timetable.
" It was necessary to go about things when the park counted least persons" he asserted.
Vehicles of the urgent services equipped with blips and with loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Underpants and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan, before intervening.
Light and recorded messages blaring with loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
While the officers in Community business entered the park equipped with their light blue windcheaters, many demonstrators simply gathered their business and left.
No tent was touched before 1 h 45 declared the Police, what left the time to the occupiers to gather their business.
Other teams of policemen were seen on perimetre, ready to intervene if arrests proved to be necessary.
Present journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesperson of the head of department of Police, maintained that this measure had been only taken by security.
But according to many journalists, the Police would have prevented them from noticing intervention inside the park, roughly kept them by the officers.
Mr Browne declared that the present lorries of TV cameras on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were capable of capturing pictures.
While the Police moved westward crossing the thick mess of business of the demonstrators, including luggage, the plastic turf and the bags of leaves filled with clothes, teams of the department of cleaning up followed, cleaning all that the occupiers left behind them.
Some demonstrators who refused to leave were dragged. Pictures were broadcast on Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators set up near the kitchen of the camping, not far from the centre of the park.
Some formed a barrier which the Police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen persons being in the epicentre of the camping hung on together.
Finally, two persons chained themselves to trees, declared Mr Kelly.
Urgent services were called to cut padlocks.
No arrest took place in the park before 3 h 30 asserted Mr Kelly.
According to the Police, the operation of cleaning ended about one hour and quarter later.
According to Mr Browne, about 142 persons were arrested in the park.
most for "confusion in public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department of Police, is the officer most gradé in s "to be found on places.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of department of the detectives, was also present.
Mr Kelly, although gift, "didn't run operations" declared Mr Browne.
A second group of policemen waited along the side Cedar Street, in case of necessary intervention is of the park, between Liberty Street and.
Barricades were put down on Cortlandt Street, a patty of houses north of the park, as well as on Pine Street, to the south.
The Police was seen there enlarging perimetre well beyond the park Zuccotti.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, would have been even seen pushing persons to move them away.
About 28 persons were of the north side.
One of the most lively night actions took place in the south of the park.
At about 5 h 00, in the south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen bursting the tyres of a lorry of Police.
At instant, an end of plywood came into sight by stealing the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalised.
The labour union of school assistants follows the city for dismissals
The labour union which represents hundreds of school assistants having lost their job last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday for discriminating and useless dismissals. Impact is disproportional on schools welcoming disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Chases are probably the ultimate weapon of the labour union, Council of the 37th Region, to try to make cancel dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators of parents and other employees, part of most worse paid by the city, lost their job on October 7th of this year. The union leaders compared these dismissals with a political revenge not to have let the city achieve a bottom for care of health run by the groups of workers, and which would have allowed to enclose the distance of budget last spring.
The local authorities disclaimed this accusation categorically.
During an audience of the Town council last month, the chancellor Dennis Mr Walcott declared that dismissals constituted a part of the budget enclosed in June.
A member of the Council countered, mentioning that the dismissals of school assistants n "were specified not at all in the budget.
The officers of the Council of the 37th Region declared that they would fill an opinion of claim, informing the department of education that it would be followed; a press conference will be organised on Wednesday to announce judicial proceedings officially to the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr Walcott and the department of l "education of the city will constitute the part defendant. The complainants will be represented by eight workers laid off, all of black colour or of origin latin-american, as most school helps who lost their job.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesperson of the legal department of the city, declared that the municipality hasn't been able yet to see the reasons of trial and can't therefore make comments on allegations.
According to a draught of complaints got by New York Times, the labour union would bet on the number of dismissals in the schools of the most disadvantaged districts of the city to support its complaint against an inequitable treatment, declaring that the poorest schools would lose most assistants because of a regular sub-financing.
While no dismissal on Staten Island, and some some barely in the establishments of Upper East Side or TriBeCa is counted, 17 school assistants lost their job in the 23rd Region of Brownsville, and 46 in 8th and 9th Regions of the south districts of Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school assistants on eight employees in the state school 36 Harlem, where 68 % schoolchildren live in poverty, chases maintain that "it isn't a district of easy parents who can bring funds to fill budgetary lack up."
The budget of l "state school 36 was reduced by 3,26 % this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional financing for every inscription d" disadvantaged pupil.
The labour union also maintains that the managers of high schools could be misled by some terms in a note allowing coordinators' dismissal of the parents.
The note used term "overtaking " to describe action, even if "overtaking " describes action more generally to move a teacher of a school towards a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the plan of complaints, "sixty-six co-ordinators of parents were laid off", and "not only because of overtaking".
Finished mission: the Congress finds an agreement on the question of Libya
It would seem finally that the Republicans and the Democrats find an agreement to Capitoline on the question of uprising in Lybia.
A successful uprising, the capture and the death of longstanding dictator Muammar Kadhafi as well as American involvement will have been needed.
The committee of the foreign relations of the Senate will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by the president John Kerry (Democrat - Massachussetts), with the senators JOHN MCCAIN (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their uprising and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution consists in honouring the courage of the Libyans while they begin rebuilding their country" John Kerry declared.
"It is a bipartisan support of their democratic aspirations."
Language is perhaps inoffensive but the debate on Libya was never simple until now.
This summer, legislators of both parties entered conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions aiming at approving or not the military role of the United States in the mission of NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and MCCAIN introduced a resolution aiming at allowing the limited job by American military strengths in Libya.
Bill was conquered by a bipartisane wide margin and has never made the object of a vote to the Senate.
But the same day of the failure of bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure aiming at reducing the financing of American operations in Libya.
American mission therefore remained under a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress upset enough to criticise the management of mission by Obama, but not enough to cut the ground from under it.
The indecision of the Congress was exceeded by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Kadhafi was killed on October 20th of this year.
La mission de La de l'OTAN s'est officiellement terminée le 31 octobre.
The Senate can currently act.
The resolution of the Committee of foreign relations "congratulates the Libyan people on his extraordinary courage and his determination with the aim of freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their partners of the alliance hired in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
Resolution also asserts "the national interest of the United States to reach a transition irreversible and achieved towards democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win all support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate or will it divide the legislators as last June?
The senator and president of the Committee Richard D. (Independent) Lugar opposed to the last version.
His spokesperson declared last Monday that Richard D. Lugar hadn't read the very last version once again plan yet.
Within Capitoline, the Chamber must vote this week for an amendment to Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans of the Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will constitute the first constitutional amendment relating to the budget, or quite other question, to get a vote to work at the Chamber or at the Senate.
Other legislators until now didn't succeed in making approve their amendments but it isn't without having tried.
The amendment of Goodlatte is part of 68 constitutional amendments to have been introduced to the Congress, on a broad fan of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same bill offered at the same time to the Chamber and to the Senate - and others are light variations of a precedent.
They count 15 versions at least at the Chamber only of amendment for a balanced budget, and another handle which "would control federal expenses".
Some of these bills are identical, but give in their support - notably the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to brag to be " the author " of such measure.
The law on the control of the budget (Budget Control Act) approved last August asked for the vote of the Chamber and of the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators one voted in favour of a not restrictive resolution supporting the idea of such amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates during which the congressmen can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to raise the border of two mandates for the presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) offered a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and to healthcare, between other subjects.
An amendment forbidding marriage between individuals of the same sex is forever proposed, just as the amendment forbidding the profanation of the flag.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of States are opposed to it.
As greedy as were the members to give amendments, they aren't also quick as in the past.
During the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 during the 110th.
Cadenza decelerates in comparison with the beginning of 1990s, when the members proposed generally more than 150 amendments every other year, according to figures given by the library of the Senate.
But these amendments didn't have much more success that they have it today.
The last amendment to have been added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but offered to the Congress in 1789.
"Slaughtered but not beaten" asserts Gabrielle Giffords during her first meeting televised since fusillade
Ten months after an armed man drew him over point-blank in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on Monday evening in a television programme, sang "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" of Broadway and declared to want first of all to recover rather than to go back to the Congress.
During its appearance in the news "20/20 " on the chain ABC, next to Diana Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled for forming sentences and needed assistant to walk.
L "programme approached its difficult return further to the bullet which fractured the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, by crossing the head.
Three months ago, she had made a return being surprising to the House of Representatives to vote for the text relating to the ceiling of debt.
During her first meeting televised since the January fusillade, which killed six persons and injured man thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and qualified her re-establishment as "difficult".
After Diana Sawyer asked him how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, answered "rather well".
Meeting with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special edition of one hour of "20/20 ", broadcast the day before the exit of the new book of the called couple "Gabby: a history of courage and of hope".
L "special programme redrew the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords since the fusillade of January 8th.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, it is seen on its bed of hospital, the shaven head and a broad scar on the forehead.
She succeeds in using one or two fingers only, with encouragement of her husband.
Some months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting down in a wheelchair while the doctors learn to her to carry simple actions out.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
Some days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast) (") to ask to change the menu of her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the re-establishment of Gabrielle Giffords: the Representative is seen singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "chorus girls Wanna Have Fun" and of Tom Petty " Free Fallin "?".
During meeting with Diana Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who passes every day two hours with the doctors, declared not to remember of fusillade.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article on the fusillade of March 12th when she stopped him and asked for the first time for information on six persons killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is kept in a prison of the Missouri and vigorously treated by waiting for trial.
" There was dead a lot" declared Gabrielle Giffords to Diana Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During its re-establishment, declared Mark Kelly to Diana Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"Therefore I would say, "Gabby, you weren't beaten", asserted Mark Kelly.
You were just slaughtered.
And you are going to take out, to recover and to come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for troops
Event: a gala on Wall Street to harvest millions of dollars for the veterans without home of the city of New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on impotence, frustration and loss.
Des centaines de soldats, marins, pilotes et les Fusiliers marins autour de lui.
The crowd in costume-tie stood up with its feet to cheer him.
"The servicemen, men and women, are considered to be heroes", declared David Saltzman, organizer of the collection of fund of the spring.
A top - gradé serviceman present at the gala, in which also participated the admiral Mike Mullen, leader d "staff of the armies of the United States, saw the role of troops in a different way.
"They were introduced as a kind of orphan", wrote the top - gradé serviceman in an email.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know it.
But it n "was no respect. Righteous man of pity.
Absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations which became established between the servicemen and a public American enthusiast but often distant.
Commendations are lavished on troops for their sacrifices.
But they have some price, declare some servicemen.
The public acts more and more as though he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are in no way victims" the corporal general Sean B declared. MacFarland, who ran troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
" But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us up in the role of unlucky minds."
It is about a very sensitive subject for the military leaders, who don't like to seem not thankful or in disagreement with the public whom they serve.
They also realise that the anger of revenantes troops of the war of Vietnam was much worse.
So, most dialogues on pity take place in any confidentiality among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons of battle with the Marines, the reprocessed colonel Mark Cancian informed it that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some people would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and travelled towards distant lands.
Others would wonder yes "an angered and violent veteran hides under the surface" declared Cancian, who fought in Iraq and came back to work on the Government in Washington.
When he searched a job, he declared, he had a feeling that some persons who got him discussions asked in a subtle way if he would be capable of being able to stand under the stress of a job demanding in Washington immediately after his return of battle.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions", reminds the colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
Difficulties of the servicemen come into sight, partly, from American indifference towards wars.
Victories are seldom congratulated by such a not very familiar country with the army and which sees not enough direct advantages of wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
"As nation, we promote no more heroism in the same way as for World War II" the general reprocessed first lieutenant David Barno, declares who ran troops in Afghanistan.
Instead of it, the congratulations of the politicians and of the people concentrate widely on the depth of the suffering of a serviceman.
Troops are admitted for the number of endured service periods, the number of lost friends or the expanse of wounds.
The army facing increasing pressure to clamp down on the rapists
This week, a key audience will decide if 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for a supposed inaction concerning rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the fellow.
The soldier of 1st classifies Elizabeth Lyman was 25-year-old and pregnant of 11 weeks the night when she asserts having been raped by a soldier.
C "was in October, 2008. She came back to her barracks to Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague transporting a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in his room to have a drink.
" C " an alarm signal" was declares Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan put the concern aside.
I thought: no, he is 19 years old.
"He is from Texas" she says.
"I will have had to follow my intuition."
Some minutes having entered the room of Elizabeth Lyman, the man caught her from behind, threw her down and violated her, she pretends.
This week, November 18th, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other servicemen, some still in service and others not, will wait with anxiety for the decision of justice during a historical trial which will take place in Arlington, in Virginia, and that will decide if a carried trial counters the ancient secretary in defence Robert Gates and its precursor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
These last are accused of not having stopped the general implementation of rapes within the army, going so contrary to the constitutional laws of the soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, trial implicated 17 complainants at first. This number came to 28 next months - 25 women and 3 men, all pretending to have been violated or to fooled sexually by colleagues soldiers. They also pretend that the army didn't neither investigate, followed nor gave justice adapted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke declares to be taken to the servicemen trimmed with braid, because problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure" she says.
"Who are the individuals in position d" to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
The lawyer also declares that since February, she was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, among which most could be part of future judicial proceedings.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all complainants in this affair - putting so all its eggs in the same basket - it will begin several trials, if necessary, to support pressure.
The team of defence, for the Department of Defence, run by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, deposited a motion to reject case.
The judicial documents, got by Newsweek, detail the strategy of defence, and principally the fact that the army can't be followed by soldiers in service or not for wounds caused in armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, called Doctrine Feres, the federal Government isn't responsible for wounds suffered by the personnel on active service.
"The alleged trouble is inherent in the military service of the complainants" documents point out.
The department of Defence refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the fifties.
While the women still have no right, officially, to go to battle, this differentiation is registered only on paper: the frontlines of the recent wars are seldom only masculine.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play a more and more important role, notably to get into contact with the local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers died - two thirds in situation of battle.
It's about time for the army to be modernised declares Susan Burke.
She isn't alone to lead this battle: three other trials are under way besides siens.
In l "school of right of Yale, the centre of legal services of the veterans prepares an affair against four main military academies to have so-called encourage a misogynous ambience.
On the other hand, nonprofitable Vietnam Veterans of America foundation prepares a trial against the army, by concentrating on diagnoses of "disturbances of the personality" allocated to the victims of rapes to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of Service Women' s Action Network (network of action of the military women), a group for human rights.
Its group sued the Administration of the Veterans in December, by accusing them of discriminating practices in the way to treat requests of advantages for the persons declaring to have been victims of a sexual attack in service.
Nine independent bills some of others were introduced to the Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, offering various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual attacks were recorded according to the centre of intervention and of prevention of sexual attacks (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the department of defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual attacks is underestimated. Indeed, according to own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure represents this year about 13,5 % 19,000 happened incidents.
The report appeared in March also studies the percentage of judicial proceedings: in 2010, 20 % cases recorded in the army made the object of a trial - the half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The complainants of the affair of Susan Burke describe their attack as the first ones of a series of traumatisms.
In the affair of Lyman, she informs the military Police of rape less about an hour later facts.
That night, she says, they asked him to tell 11 times in details his rape different policemen, doctors and commanders.
She suffered one "rape kit" (literally a kit of rape), and the blood of her attacker - due to a cut in the arm - was found in its bed.
Six months later, in April, 2009, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting down in front of a judge, in a trial in the course of which she is questioned on her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her attack.
Six persons manifested as witnesses of morality for the author of crime, who ended up being paid off.
"I remember in the daytime when the verdict was returned" Elizabeth Lyman declares.
"I thought that I am going to begin having shrinkages. I started to shout after the court."
"I was put in psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember having said to my commander "It wasn't his trial but mine"."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who ended up diagnosing a confusion of the personality, rendering her incapable of service.
In January, 2010, it was returned under terms less than honourable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Affair Lyman and other complainants will advance or not, it is a long history, declares John Turley, professor of right to the Faculty of Right of the university of Washington.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance".
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I always criticised doctrine Feres.
The army is of decades behind coach it has no same advantages and means of dissuasion put down by responsibility.
"Chances are heavily against them but it is important that they try", he adds.
These things change only when good has the will to fight.
If trial doesn't turn in their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will gather her hundred of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue fighting against the army on this question as long as there won't be reform" she asserts.
Where jusqu "in what we would die, the one or other one of both options.
Walls have eyes: the researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy announcing his opinions online anti-immigration.
On Monday, Breivik, which admitted having been taken of a bloody madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with its first trial.
While Breivik has acts alone, he was far from the being on the cyberspace: it had passed a lot of time preceding the attack on its computer, to discuss with some some of the millions of nationalists who support the groups of extreme right on the sites of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know about it more about these persons.
But how to find them?
Facile... Connectez-vous à Facebook.
"We realised that he n" this was not so difficult as to find them", declares Jamie Bartlett, main author of a report published recently by the discussion group of DEMOS on numerical Populism in Europe.
Facebook is packed with so much personal information, asserts Jamie Bartlett, that the researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the site to find the persons that they search with a scientific precision - the way the marketing experts make him many years.
L "team of Jamie Bartlett discovered that a half million members is fans of the groups of extreme right in Europe. She targeted them with announcements, but instead of linking them up with a new group or produced, announcements invited the users to answer an inquiry. Asked questions concerned their level of education, their attitudes facing violence and their optimism as for their own future.
By getting into contact with these persons thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues could question 10,000 supporters of 14 parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"It is a new way of making research", declares Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are surprising in no way: the online supporters of the groups of right are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who link online and outstanding activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their screen of computer."
L "study of DEMOS is only an example on the way Facebook became the new inevitable tool in the hands of the scientists.
Discussion groups, researchers in medicine and political scientists use the site to study all subjects which touch questions of health as social tendencies, thanks to "I like", publications on walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users who add three contents on average a day, the "supernova of data" generates an explosion in research, augmenting the number of research works the name of the site of which appears in the title of almost 800 % in comparison with five last years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook domiciles due to the fact that he allows you to study persons whom you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to perform inquiries into the persons of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would have never authorised you to enter", declares Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all that - you have directly access to their information."
Others say that the site could give a means to identify and to treat health and social problems.
According to a recent study of D. Megan Moreno of the university of Wisconsin-Madison, and its colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook about their feats in a state of intoxication had tremendously more chances to be alcoholic than the discreet students on this subject.
Megan Moreno suggests that the colleagues of the students, such as the advisers, could watch the site and intervene to help possibly a student about whom status would speak too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it", Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and manager of the centre for health, behaviour and development of the children in the Research institute for the children located in Seattle, asserts Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children with risks, and which would be in other one not admitted cases."
Facebook also always achieves the information of his users.
L "team of the site which takes care of data studied statistics concerning loving situation and in the daytime of saint Valentin, the turnout rate on elections of mi-mandate of 2010 and indication of national happiness (thanks to only available information - the champions of numerical freedom supported for a long time that the site could make available its treasure of data to other persons for research aims).
But the users of Facebook know that the site notices them, that this please them or not - to be possible play the Scrabble with a friend who is in thousands of kilometres, the site is authorised to achieve your information.
But what's happening when the users of Facebook are part of an inquiry about which they even didn't hear?
While the researchers have left luggage offices defined well as for the way to gather information otherwise than by way of the Internet, he is quite other online thing.
"I don't think that a big number of users already thinks of the fact that a researcher could study their profile" Neil Selwyn, sociologist in the Laboratory of Knowledge of London, according to a study of 2006 declares which he led by noticing the walls Facebook of his students.
"As much as they know, exchanges were seen only by their friends."
Then the question of methodology comes.
Even without passing by Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of the truth of a profile or on the wall of an user.
"What you say about Facebook and what you make in reality is two completely different things", asserts Neil Selwyn.
That is why, in spite of his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a notepad and a fountain pen remain the best tools which it is possible to use.
"Nothing will be able to replace the real world and the contact with people, "he declares.
" Social studies are supposed to approach the social aspect - and the social, it isn't in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man having allowed to have organised both assassination attempts which made 77 dead in Norway this summer, described as a combatant "of resistance" during his first appearance in the trial which takes place in Oslo.
"I am a military governor of the Norwegian movement of resistance and the Templars of Norway", he explains in front of a room of audience filled with 500 persons.
"As regards the competence of the court, I challenge her, because you hold your mandate of organisations supporting an ideology of hate and because he supports the multiculturalism."
"I admit facts but I don't plead guilty."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to let him opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Breivik, who brought a speech with him on paper, to speak to the parents of the victims at the end of audience.
The judge Nesheim also asked the Police to keep Breivik in detention twelve weeks besides, he forbade to speak to media during four weeks and informed him that authorities would watch from too close distance all visits and correspondence during eight weeks.
Around thirty parents of survivors and of victims were present at audience.
Some people came in the hope of looking at Breivik in eyes, others to be sure than he would be put behind bars.
All participated in audience with the intention of seeing the purpose of trial.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman" a survivor of Utoya in the Norwegian television channel NRK declared.
"I n" not comfortable props, but I personally a bit advanced having seen and heard the suspect."
Dressed in a dark costume and in a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional during all trial. He looked at the journalists and at the survivors in eyes by entering and by going out of the court.
In spite of strange idea according to who Breivik belongs to a large movement of "resistance", the judge determined that he wasn't mad. He also declared that there is no proof which he has acts with accomplices.
The assassination attempts of July 22nd therefore seem to be the work of an extremist rather than of a whole group from radical, what will comfort perhaps some.
But it doesn't reduce grief or confusion felt by all nation.
"I will have preferred that he resembles a monster, but it isn't case", declared a parent of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons of the interview lost by Steve Jobs, in the cinema this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5th of this year, some people compared him with Henry Ford - distinguishing themselves by technical genius and inventor of modern computer science.
But what the fans of Apple can find of more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found recently and that will be broadcast this week in the first one left a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative mind had included processes and working flux of products.
He was unquestionably a creator and a dreamer. He became identified with a hippy but was also very careful and was organised, as well as an améliorateur of flowcharts - a man who thought that many leaders of firms suffered of a "illness letting them think that a brilliant idea makes 90 % jobs [but] a considerable quantity of manual job separates a brilliant idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed television series " Triumph of the Nerds ". This series redraws the birth of the computer, and he sits down during more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare dialogue.
In this epoch, it had been about 10 years since Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple. He worked already hard on his new computer firm NEXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a baby left maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he declares that the main copies disappeared in the transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the film director.
This video, slightly taken back up, is the base of the film of 68 minutes called Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, who will be broadcast in the cinema next Wednesday and Thursday.
For somebody known to detest deepened discussions, Steve Jobs seems here surprisingly passionate to display technological philosophies and his commercial strategies.
Et incroyablement attentif.
On four different points during meeting, answers come a long instant after questions - between 10 and 15 seconds from reflexion, during which Steve Jobs weighs his thoughts apparently, with the intention of bringing a definite answer.
Instants are also discovered when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs re-emerges, where it seems impatient to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him jogs to make it speed up and pass to questions or subjects of bigger importance.
Having filmed before l "epoch of Pixar, of the iPod or of the iPhone, a mysteriously prescient aspect on Lost Interview is found. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers of token or bad to other firms and announces his own vision on the future of computer science.
It is a thing to read posthumous valuation of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something raw and of inspiring on the man whom we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of size.
He has a vision on the way things can be and have to be.
He explains it then the following dishes in work.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way he learnt to run a firm:
" During all these years, I always asked: 'Why do you make things?" and answers are always the same: 'oh, simply because it is necessary to make it. '"
Nobody knows why, nobody thinks in depth about things in a firm.
It is what I discovered.
Steve Jobs continues by giving details on his efforts aiming at simplifying accountancy to Apple.
Perplexed as for the way costs were recorded - they often start with a "standard cost" assessed at a rough guess, then adjusted with a "variation" - it developed an automated plant which guaranteed the definite calculation of the commercial costs.
On opportunity to play a turn the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" which he created with Steve Wozniak - an apparatus which served for pirating telephone networks and for phoning free in long - distance.
The apparatus made the object of many writings in anticipation, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in its description of the Blue Box as an act of taking over is infectious.
He describes the way he and Wozniak tested the box by using a pay phone, by making a call then connected from a network AT*JYT0KT to other one while by-passing so many satellites as possible.
"We enveloped the bowl of different things a half a dozen of time and you howled in the pay phone and this arrived at you one minute later to the pay phone of in side, "explain Jobs by laughing.
" We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learnt that we could create something ourselves capable of controlling thousand millions of dollars of facilities worldwide."
We didn't know thing big both, but we could invent a small thing capable of controlling big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have a day existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a marvellous turn which he and Wozniak perfected: he phoned to Vatican City with the Blue Box right in the middle of the night by passing for Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of Catholic hierarchy are called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, both accomplices leave in mad laugh just before the Pope is awakened himself.
On his love with technology (and door-to-door selling of Bill Hewlett):
In l "age of 12 years, in the hunt for spare parts to fabricate a fréquencemètre, he searches the number of Bill Hewlett in the directory and phones to it.
Shortly after their dialogue of 20 minutes, Steve Jobs gets a job of part-time summer to Hewlett-Packard.
"It had one remarkable influence on me. C" the only firm was that I had seen in this age and it formed my definition of a firm and the way the employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the employees HP to visit the research laboratories of the firm, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the first "computer of never conceived office."
It was also big that a suitcase, had small one cathode-ray tube. I fell in love with it.
The teenager that j "props went back at the place of HP and began writing programmes for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several instants in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to invent new products on impulse.
At the beginning of his career, while he becomes established to sell some cards of printed circuits, a client asks him to put together a complete computer.
Working in only 30 days of credit, he should take care of assemblage as well as delivery of the finished apparatus.
Later, to Apple, he remembers difficulties met to develop a mouse of computer:
"I remember big disputes they shouted me over by pretending that I would need five years [to fabricate a mouse who would cost 300 $]. I had it enough, I went out and to see a concepteur."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse whom we could fabricate for 15 $ and who proved to be terrifically reliable.
On the big firms which get breathless:
Long before that he makes relive Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders are going to make a mistake and lost the control of their market share.
"Let's suppose that you worked at the place of IBM or Xerox, you make a better photocopier or a better printer, and afterwards?"
You have the monopoly of the market, therefore the firm more doesn't meet with success.
Sales and marketing can bring some change in her, therefore [these are these types of persons] who end up running firms and personnel specialised in product are put in l "distance of the catches of decisions.
The genius there produces who drove to this position of monopoly is completely rotted by the persons who can't imagine to conceive a good product in comparison with a bad product - requested manual job.
It is what occurred at the place of Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to keep all computer industry.
She would have been able to make ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the nineties...
They tore defeat off from victory.
On innovation as artistic form:
"A huge part of manual job separates a brilliant idea of an exceptional product as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You teach tremendously on his subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things which you can't make, electrons can him, the glass, robots, plants also.
You must keep thousands of things in the mind (these concepts) by putting them together them some in others.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It is a question of trying to display to you in the best products which the men created, and to try to bring these things in the product which you create.
Picasso said a day which the good artists copy and which the big artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal very good ideas.
It is partly what returns exceptional Macintosh. The persons who worked over were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it isn't for computer science, they would have made the extraordinary things in another domain.
Scalia and Thomases have dinner with adversaries of the right of health while the court meets
When the Supreme Court meets in camera to examine the question of political dissension, to know if the opposition to the law of the president Obama of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were pointed out during a dinner backed by the law firm which will defend affair in front of the High Court of Justice.
Event was last Thursday, when nine judges met for a conference aiming at discussing petitions for examination.
One of the business in question concerned a trial begun by 26 States questioning the ambitious reform of healthcare voted by the Congress the last year, a law which was a point of rallying for the conservative activists on a national scale.
The judges agreed to hear complaint, indeed, waits one next March for a monumental argument of 5 h 30, and result will be probably likely to favour the destabilization of the presidential running of 2012, which will be booming at the time when the decision of the court will be pronounced.
The lawyer who will be held before the court and argue about the rejection of law, will be probably Paul Clement, who served as general supplicant of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was part of both dozens of offices which helped to back the annual dinner of the Society Federalist (Federalist Society), a longstanding group devoted to defend conservative legal principles.
Another office which backed the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations which questioned law, national Federation of the independent firms (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, who introduces a huge financial stake in the result of litigation.
Dinner was held to a hotel Washington some hours after the conference of the court on affair.
MITCH MCCONNELL, republican beep of the Senate and adversary declared of the law of health was, between others there.
The guests star in dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It isn't new: both judges were present at events of the Society Federalist during years.
And there is nothing that goes contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempted from code of behaviour which governs the actions of the federal judges.
If they were he, they would argue undoubtedly by the code of Cannon 4C, which stipulates: "A judge can attend collections of fund of organisations linked to right and others well than the judge couldn't be a dealer, a guest of honour, or appearing on the programme of such event".
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas close to two of the law firms of affair, as well as to a firm having a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of the governmental ethics.
"This violation of the ethics and superb indifference regarding code contradicts statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges", declared Bob Edgar, president of Common Reason.
"The judges drank and had dinner and in a collection of fund of gala with lawyers with cases in authority before the court".
Their presence and their participation in the collection of fund of this event disassembles any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomases showed not enough respect for critics maintaining that they blend too easily the business of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a conservative activist of top - profile.
Moreover, the conservatives pretend that it is the judge Elena Kagan with a problem of ethics, and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general supplicant of the administration of Obama when the first oppositions to law were carried at the level of the higher level court.
Her critics lobbied so that Kagan challenges to hear case, saying that she had too much put itself into the defence of law to be uncommitted.
Kagan gave no indication that it would make it.
Boeing records a record 18 thousand million dollar order for civil aircrafts
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, civil aircrafts bi-corridors, with possibility to buy 20 more.
Boeing sells also six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market was estimated at more than a thousand million dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary in it than a company receives an order considering 50 of its products.
It is on the other hand the whole affair when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and what taking him up of these 50 planes attained the record sum 18 thousand million dollars.
Also incredible is from whom Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future orders of planes.
In predictions published on Monday, the company of Chicago thinks that the airlines of the Middle East will need in 20 next years of 2 520 planes of a complete 450 thousand million dollar value.
In the course of the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive order of commercial airliners of the history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai which placed this Pharaonic order.
Boeing announced in the Aicraft Living room of Dubai of 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 planes besides, what would raise the sum of order in 26 thousand million dollars.
On the other hand, Boeing pointed out on Monday that the Oman company Air ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model which prides itself on important savings of fuel and on facilities for the passengers.
The sum of these six apparatus s "pupil in more than a thousand million dollars.
"It is apparently very positive for Boeing, "declared Neal Dihora, analyst of Morningstar.
"These clients especially have a huge value."
In the Middle East, the oil-producing countries have many their airlines.
They have therefore not only the means to pay these planes, but the rise of the price of the fuel - usually detrimental for airlines because it represents their the most important expenses - wouldn't be so harmful to them since the country would make money with the rise of the price of oil.
It is an important point because these companies will be less touchy than others to cancel or to postpone their orders of planes when the price of oil augments, signalled Dihora.
"They have a natural cover of risk", he said.
The order of Emirates reinforces the predominance of Boeing on the market of planes jumbo aircrafts and helps to slow down the try of encroachment of the rival Airbus with its plane A350.
The victory of Boeing in the living room of aeronautics arrives four months afterwards the announcement of Airbus to put back the beginning of the biggest version of A350, which competes directly with Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus pushes back its beginning to augment increase by it continuation at the request of his clients to augment its capacity of load and its autonomy.
The actions of the company Boeing augmented by 1.5 % to attain 67,94 dollars.
The sister of the Mexican president apparently beaten on elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon declares that the drugs dealers helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo du PRI in running in governor's post.
The sister of the president Felipe Calderon seems to have lost her try of access to functions of governor of Michoacán in the course of violent elections, and she declared on Monday that the drugs dealers favoured one of his adversaries.
The first results pointed out that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of running in governor's post of this Western State.
"The intervention of organised crime during all process of vote and especially yesterday is a frightening fact, not only for Michoacán but also for country entirely", signalled Luisa Maria Calderon to the radio in the course of an interview on Mondays according to elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They took over ballot boxes, installed road dams and made people vote" for PRI.
PRI governed Mexico during seventy years jusqu "to lose the presidency in 2000.
But he organises his return, and a victory in Michoacán is a step mattering in this effort.
PRI hopes to earn presidential election l "in July.
Vallejo seems to have distanced itself only of not much of Calderon, which was at the head of opinion polls before the day elections.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative party of his brother, the Party National Action, or SECTION, refused to admit Vallejo as victor.
Silvano Aureoles, candidate of left of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, which holds currently positions of governor, arrived third, a hard defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this divided and unhappy left.
Glory also refused to admit the first results.
Vallejo, ancient mayor of Morelia, the capital of l "State, denied any link with the drugs dealers and deeply recommended to other candidates to accept results.
Michoacán was dominated for a long time by drug cartels specialised in the traffic of marihuana, of heroine and of méthamphétamine.
It is of l "State of origin of the president Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to throw a military offensive against the traffickers in December, 2006.
However, violence persisted.
A week before elections a mayor of the SECTION was assassinated while he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates abandoned the countryside locally by fright.
However, for PRI, however corrupt elections of Michoacán have air, a victory will help the party in its impetus.
The man who is waited to represent PRI in running to presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo since Washington and declared, "I think that this victory is very encouraging with the aim of next year."
BASD deeply encourages the Asia to help the euro area
The Asiatic Bank of Development asked in India and in China to get ready to help the euro area to go out of the crisis of sovereign debt to avoid a long-term reduction which would prevent development of l "Asiatic economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the BASD based in Manila, declared that both economic powers in the quickest growth of the world had to "make all that is in their power" to speed up the recovery of the monetary zone by means of the International Monetary Bottom or direct bilateral agreements.
He disadvised to BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at difficulties of Europe of a "uninterested eye" and signalled that an Asiatic financial support beside the leaders and the resources of Europe would allow d "to avoid a long-term collapse of l" worldwide economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"As a result whoever can help Europe to go out of crisis am useful", he said to Financial Times in the course of an interview during the worldwide Economic Forum in Bombay.
"The Asia can be protected jusqu" in some point but she isn't in the shelter."
"Therefore if China and India can help, that nothing prevents them from it."
These last months, the euro area was seriously shaken by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan dangerously zoomed and the First ministers of Italy and of Greece resigned.
The flourishing crisis of sovereign debt in Europe made flow the fright which l "worldwide economy takes in in recession, and provoked the call of the main emergent savings to meet to help the euro area to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would route any Asiatic help, but he also declared that this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the fund of financial rescue of the United States, the European Fund of financial stability - gave a bigger power of negotiations to the Asiatic partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade and Industry Indian, pointed out that "India will make all what she will be able" to help the euro area given that its own economy suffers now from a fall of export and from a drying up of the arrivals of foreign capitals.
"Nobody wants that the euro area remains unstable and agitated", he said.
"We have monumental challenges to be raised and we must support a high level of growth."
"It isn't a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find job for the dozens millions of our young men and women?"
Others support that savings in development such as India shouldn't help the European rich men while they face up their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor to the university Brown in the United States, declared that it would be politically very difficult to make accept a help to Europe in 1,2 thousand millions of Indian, among which at least 800 000 live with 2 dollars a day, or even less.
"Once they will discover that the Greeks retire in 50 years and that they go on holiday in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow it", he signalled.
Lee Howell, the president of the worldwide economic Forum, also wondered why the reservations of India should be used to support of many Greek civil servants paid well in jobs badly managed which generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr Nag declared that the crisis of the euro area risked causing significant repercussions " across the Asia.
The predictions of BASD of a 7,5 % economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 confront now "risks of loss" because of European threat.
He signalled that the vulnerable emergent markets needed d draw up plans of help" to protect themselves from an economic reversal and from important escapes of capitals.
Strict warnings of the Pentagon on the potential reductions of defence
The Secretary in Defence, Leon Panetta, made take pressure up on the Congress on Monday, informing that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He launched a financial chain reaction of the corridors of the Pentagon in the battlefields of Afghanistan, by way of civilians' gathering.
The Pentagon digest already 450 thousand million dollars of reductions for next decade, but feared now that an additional 600-dollar sum or more compression is imminent if the Congress doesn't reach an agreement on expenses.
"The impacts of these reductions would be destructive for the ministry", declared Panetta in a letter to the senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He declared that the failure of the Congress to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in what is called sequestration, would draw away 23 % reductions as well as the frost of many new plans.
"Such an important reduction, applied so without judiciousness, would return most our ships and our impracticable plans of building - you can't buy three quarters of a ship or of a building - and undermine gravely other efforts of modernisation", writes Panetta to the senators.
"We would be also forced to part from some our civil personnel and, because the reduction would be so fast imposed, we should almost indeed send civilians in leave without wage with a view to reaching target."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our servicemen and would harm our preparation seriously."
Reductions would touch possibly the combat troops, Panetta goes on.
"Although the financing in times of war of the count of the operations of eventuality abroad isn't directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disturbances in basic budgets", informed Panetta.
"The contracting personnel would would been reduced, rousing of delays in contracts and supervision of the contract which support war".
"Personnel managing wages would would been reduced, rousing of delays of payment to the war suppliers, and legal and political support would be unsettled".
Both senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compression on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration to the department of Defence would have would launch a quick decline of the United States as outright worldwide leader of military power".
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action", declared the senators in a common statement on Monday afternoon during the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"It isn't a consequence with which we can live, and it isn't indeed the one that we should impose ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat for the interests of national security of the United States, and it shouldn't occur".
That the letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of the senators augment pressure for a budgetary compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon of reductions, remain to see.
Panetta was more and more virulent about possible compression, even if he reached the highest post of the Pentagon himself combining years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, secretary in Defence painted a dark picture of what could happen - a serviceman with a shell, but no core.
"It is a ship without sailors".
"C'est une la brigade sans balles".
"It is a fighter, without enough formed pilots".
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, of buildings and of bombs without enough formed soldiers capable of fulfilling mission", declared Panetta during the preliminary comments in the Pentagon.
"It is a force depressed, badly prepared and unable to face up potential adversaries".
"De facto, she invites to attack.."
In an addendum in the letters in MCCAIN and Graham, Panetta enunciated specifically how new reductions could "generate important operational risks: delay of answer to crises, conflicts and disasters; strict borders in our capacity to display and to hire us in the world; and unacceptable taken risk in operations of future battle".
And Panetta declared that some of the biggest plans of defence would be possible pass to the cleaver, including those already tested and some just at the first stadiums of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new envisaged bomber, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new ship of coastal battle and the new vehicle of ground, which would replace Humvee of army and of navy.
To put an end to development and to trials of F35 could generate 80 thousand million dollars of savings over 10 years, but his supporters say that it is an essential stage of improvement and of answer to the potential threats of China and of other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look on the recent cuffs points out to what extent deceit and lie are omnipresent in daily life.
The republican candidate for the presidency Herman Cain is occupied to exchange allegations of sexual harassment with several women; every side accusing other one of lying.
The administrators of Penn State were accused of perjurer to have supposedly covered reports according to which a football coach in retirement attacked boys sexually.
Last week the French president Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by one microphone opened maintaining to the American president Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
The congressman of New York and publicity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, was taken for an idiot by issuing fast denials contradicted by irrefutable proof.
The ancient candidate for presidential election John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of countryside linked to the cover of an extramarital link.
And then, none of the one who lived history will never forget the media circus which the president Bill Clinton launched by lying during his second term on ​​ his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating in the tests of the school and of the university are legion.
There were cases where the teachers gave the answers of tests to the pupils to be well seen on their valuation of performance.
The mentors who should teach the opposite send the message according to who lie and the cheating is allowable.
How much deceit do we meet?
On given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, a lot of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that the foreigners fool themselves three times in first 10 minutes of their meeting.
To discern or to spot lies is an essential competence which each must acquire, at the same time for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a similar parlour game in, let's say, charades, where objective is to exclaim: "I had you", the detection of deceit is a serious branch of knowledge founded on scientific data gathered in the course of six last decades in prestigious universities having performed a research in depth of such plans, notably in psychology and in physiology.
One of the results of research is that the most ancient myths on lie were demystified.
The liars look at you in eyes.
They stutter, go red or don't always fidget.
Don't conclude from it that the liars are difficult to discern and difficult to unmask.
A skilled lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of statement, facial micro-expressions, training of question and response time.
I passed several years to examine scientific results in the large body and always emergent of knowledge on deceit, and it is clear that the detection of deceit is a modern competence which is easy to teach and useful to sail in our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities notably include appointment, meetings, negotiation or management.
The good liars are clever at reading others well, by putting them at ease, by managing their own emotions and intuitively discerning how others receive them.
We know according to researches that extravertis lies more than the introverts, that the men to say lies more "centered on them" while the women say more lies "centered on others" - habitually to protect the feelings of somebody - than the married persons lie less often to their partners than the not married persons (but that the lies which they tell have tendency to be huge).
We also know that if you are received as a mécréant, others are going to feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if somebody lies?
First of all, notice the normal behaviour of your subject.
It is what they call "to establish data landmarks".
It helps to give a point of reference to measure subsequent changes.
Notice the position of your subject, laugh, vocal quality.
You must know if somebody moves his feet normally permanently not to level unfair accusations when you see him moving feet in the middle of meeting.
Then search indications of not verbal and verbal misleading behaviours.
Consider these indications to be red flags, no proof of deceit.
Misleading people can immobilise the top of the body when they try to remember their history, they can check their feet off towards the door, lean towards an exit, change position significantly or introduce a relief of "post interview" - a sigh exaggerated by relief, a change of position when all difficult questions passed.
The interviewers point out often erroneously that maintenance is ended only to try to launch reaction post interview.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
Famous Scott Peterson skidded by using past while pretending that his assassinated wife was alive, launching a national research to find it.
The misleading individuals can also use an outdistanced language: "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or to repeat entirely a difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Somebody can use a lot of "political cant" during his answer to a difficult question: "Oh well to say plainly if I remember property in my knowledge."
It returns factual rather than perceptive answer and is often a red flag.
There isn't magic formula as the detection of lies, but the development of competences to admit deceit is possible.
These competences will improve chances of whoever to avoid the victimisation by swindlers in their professional and personal life.
The plan of controversial oil pipeline will be put off after the threat of late approval of the United States
Some days after the administration of Obama threatens to postpone the approval of a plan of oil pipeline between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - provoking the anger of labour unions while appeasing the environmentalists - the society trying to construct the said oil pipeline that it is ready to re-run plan to delay it on rails.
TransCanada declared on Monday evening that it is going to move the pipeline cast out of the ecologically sensitive zone of the dunes of Nebraska, and am confident that plan is however going to earn its approval.
The society announced decision during a press conference in Capitoline of Nebraska.
The official of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, maintains that the company remains confident that it will end up getting the approval of an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
It follows the announcement by the State department last week when it would postpone its decision of conferment of a federal licence for plan until it receives new studies of potential routes allowing to avoid the zones of the dunes of Nebraska and of water-bearing Ogallala, from large underground sources of water.
"It is a true way forward", points out Lee Terry, a republican of Nebraska with Fox terrier News.
The new examination of environment ordered by the State department would have probably rejected any decision until 2013, after elections of next year, although the civil servants disclaim the involvement of politics in decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described decision as being the decision of the State department, and shone expressed his support.
The 2,735 km oil pipeline would stretch of Canada towards the gulf of Mexico.
Il transporterait 700 000 par barils jour depuis de la province de l'Alberta vers les raffineries du Texas.
In order to do that, it would be necessary to him to cross six States.
He is hated by the environmentalists, but liked by working parties, who bet on 20 000 jobs considered to be linked to the oil pipeline.
But the legislators of Nebraska compared to this plan lobby that a law for force the distance of the region of Sand Hills and of water-bearing Ogallala, a major source of drinking water and of irrigation.
The environmental environmental impact assessment in the course of the State department found that plan would put down only limited negative environmental impacts, but the industry of energy declared that the general inspector of the ministry ordered an inquiry distinct from the process of examination, centered on two questions.
The one is that a lobbyst hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser of countryside of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the programme.
Other one is to know if a firm which was engaged to lead initial study was an inappropriate choice all over its relation in TransCanada.
PATTI LABELLE followed for supposedly causing a preschooler to vomit of fright
A family of New York maintains that the diva PATTI LABELLE disco music thrown in a bursting out of violence in the foyer of their building of Manhattan, terrified their small daughter in the point where she vomited it of fright.
The diatribe of the singer " lady Marmalade " scared the 18-month-old baby Geneviève Monk, to such an extent that it suffered "changes of personality, sleep troubles" and "the augmented fear of foreigners", says its family in the course of the trial of the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was on November 10th of last year while the technician of stage Kevin Monk, his teaching wife of kindergarten, Roseanna, and Geneviève got ready to go on a trip in family.
While Kevin Monk is going to search the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the foyer of their building of the boulevard Riverside with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in the arms.
Roseanna Monk declared that she had stopped near the door and put down her daughter for instant.
"Somebody arrived behind me and said to me: "Do you Know what makes your daughter?" I said " yes " and I went to search her", she says.
LABELLE admonished with anger the pregnant woman.
"She said to me about tone aggressive: "You shouldn't leave your daughter near the door", says Roseanna Monk.
"I answered him: "what you say or think doesn't interest me".
She became fanatical and began using swearwords - word "" and word "" in a strong voice...
She had a bottle of water and began spraying me with some water of the bottle.
She declared that in this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman: "Look at what you made to my daughter", says the mother of the child.
LABELLE threw itself on the mom - who always held Geneviève in the arms - and must be kept by his circle with him entrainée towards a car which waited for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The small girl cried so very much as she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for excuses of LABELLE, but got no answer.
The lawyer and the representatives of LaBelle didn't turn our calls to comment.
Complaint claims not specified damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, declared that he took case free and that the family plans to give all money received in a charity activity against the cancer for the children.
"Purpose consists in holding PATTI LABELLE responsible for its behaviour", declared Mr Davis.
"This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially towards a teacher of nursery school carrying a 18-month-old child."
Climatic adversity slowed economy down
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa the unemployment and the informalité augmented, the foreign investment went down and economy contracted
2011 is one year which they will remember in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-conscript of the change, that generated big waitings as regards the advances of the economy, but being given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year, increase doesn't watch each other, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart to cause losses of billions for agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the economy of the State for growth, caused a shrinkage of economic activity in general by 3,6 for one hundred in the first semestre of the year, justified mainly by review lower 31,16 for one hundred in agriculture, which affected dynamism of other one economic sectors.
According to the report of allocations by jellies existent by the Mexican Council of Development Rural Bearable, there was damage of 582 millions 835 cultivated hectares, among which one 78,03 for one hundred suffered from damage complete and the rest of 21,07 for one hundred suffered from partial damage, main stricken cultures were vegetables, corn and mean pea.
The fall of economic activity generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the unemployment rate of the State during first three quarters of the year an increase speeded up was noticed, because while from January till March, 55 one thousand and 053 sinaloens were unemployed persons, with a rate of 4,53 for one hundred Active Economic Populations, in the second quarter the rate became 5,28 for one hundred and from July till September average continued raising 6,19 until for one hundred, a rate which represents 74 thousand more than sinaloens unemployed persons, an increase in comparison with the first semestre of 18 thousand and 969 969 persons.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during year is multifactorial, according to the economist Gerardo López Cervantès, manager of the Faculty of Economic and social sciences of UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to actions accomplished by the public policy.
"What is noticed it is an increase in the unemployment which is due to various factors, between that the loss of liquidity on the market owed to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to fight the laundering of money, because for people who earn dollars in an illicit way it isn't easy that they work to earn them, that they invest them and use them in something", he says.
Kept migration
López Cervantès signalled that the increase in unemployment is as due to a demographic factor.
"The number of persons who leave the State to go to work abroad, on the United States was restrained, first because of difficulties of entrance and secondly because by entering they have already a lot of difficulties to find job, these people stay here and ask it working sources, what makes that unemployment raises", it declared has.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the sinaloen working market deteriorates by considering the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60,38 for one hundred populations occupied in this state works on it without paying the contribution as worker to any institution of social insurance.
Apart of unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason of gap for the state the low wages are, entity has the lower remunerations of the Country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Working secretariat and Social Prediction.
The medium monthly incomes of the sinaloens workers was, until September, 5 thousand and 352 pesos, very lower in national average, which is in 7 thousand and 375 pesos.
Contraction d'IED
Apart fall of economic activity and increase in unemployment, in 2011 they recorded the strongest reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment of 10 last years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January till June IED of the State attained 630 thousand and 697 dollars, what represents a fall of 87.74 for one hundred in comparison with 5 millions 143 one thousand and 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In its turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State counts a complete investment of 17,280 billions pesos a year, recorded mainly by the companies of service sector.
Debt
Given the scenario of economic shrinkage, the Government of the State solicited in July to the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 billions pesos, intended municipes 18 for the investment in plans of facilities in, with objective to reactivate economy, the approval of the congress of the State was 2,600 billions pesos and until November no benefit of the debt in any sector of the economy of the State was noticed.
Reactions
For the representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of capacity of management of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Industry of Transformation, declared that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the different sectors, enclosed the Government of the State.
"The output of the economy of Sinaloa during this year was indeed very poor, it is necessary to work intensely to recover the ground which we lost this year, in 2012 we must double effort our, it was necessary to line up the effort of all and especially the good walk already synchronised of this new team of Government, let's hope that next year is much better", has he says.
Economic slowness
Loredo López declared that events as jellies of the beginning of the year kept the economy of the State and restrained its output and growth.
"The bottom economic fluxe is produced of several events, between which jellies, one of the main effects was a slow economy which turns rather fast to generate an economic dynamism which allows to have an allowable level e flux in trials, products and services and as a result, at the end of the year we close a lot under waitings which we had", he says.
Redefine vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers' Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa declared that they want to canalise the State towards productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we noticed that they worked, we think that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme which redefined vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that they detonate all potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa", he says.
Many to make
The president of Coparmex underlined the importance to establish a vision of future which canalises better efforts of the Government.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government made efforts to give good results in different domains, in economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop one programmed term in long", he declared.
He signalled that the current administration showed advances in the way of management of the public policy.
"There are elements which allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say it is that they worked a lot and the Government is conscious due to the fact that there is still a lot to be", he says.

The manager of local Social Development pointed out that even if until now the programmes of building advanced, they are in a situation of risk, because the Government of the State released not from its obligations to give contributions which exceed 11 millions pesos in three programmes.
He signalled that in total, the investment of these three programmes is nearly 50 millions pesos, with which the State must give 25 for one hundred and until now only the Federation and Municipe gave resources for works, as a result there is the possibility of a delay in their revision.
"They have to give a contribution of 12 millions and in spite of the fact that the year is soon going to finish they gave nothing to us, even if since July they had to give us a part", he says, "and to us, to record no delays, we began works and we advanced a lot, but we need some money".

The Court validates " the analogical cut " in Mexico in 2015
Substitution of signal analogical by the digital one of the exchange rates more important is than the world endured last years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) nonsuited constitutional controversies that Senat and Chamber of Deputies formulated against the presidential decree which moves forward the said "analogical cut" from 2021 till 2015, because eight necessary polls to invalidate it weren't united.
A minority of four ministers, enclosed the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that the president Felipe Calderón didn't exceed his attribution when he issued the decree which details actions to be followed to make transition concrete on the digital television of the Earth.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was nonsuited not to have attained the qualified majority of eight polls so that the Court pronounces on the constitutionalité or not - constitutionalité of the decree, and this continues being in force.
The plan of sentence, worked out by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, offered the statement of the decree as non-constitutional, because of fact that the regulation in radio and television is an attribution reserved by law for the Federal Committee of Telecommunications (Cofetel), in infraction of the principles of hierarchic subordination and of reservation of law.
In favour of plan voted only for Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and for Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, so much the Senate as the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to question the decree and by accepting complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions envisaged by this one for digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers solved to nonsuit also the complaint formulated by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the plan the minister Sánchez Cordero of which is also representative.
In its intervention, the minister govern said that he didn't agree with arguments of plan, in sense that federal Executive can't structure measures through general norms so that the public administration gets ready for it.
"I consider either than if he made it they would affect the autonomy of the regulating organ", and he reminded that the planning of public policies in strategical domains as the sector of telecommunications is the responsibility of the federal Executive, for constitutional mandate with the direction of the State.
Substitution of signal analogical by one signal digital one of the changes the most important is that the world suffered last years and it is translated in a better working of the radioelectrical spectre, a better quality of the signal and more chains.
To defer change, has him supported, would be defer the benefits of the digitalisation which implicates a decision of public interest not only with one technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political questions and national security".
These questions, has it underlined, "demand the operation of the whole system establishes, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, includes a group of attribution which Constitution grants in the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He reminded that a big number of countries of everybody has already finished digital transition and they made it through Executive, in spite of the fact that they had the extremely specialised technical organs.
It isn't possible to conclude that Executive, by issuing the questioned decree, pervades in a form the sphere of competences of the Congress, because he assures in the administrative sphere the respect for laws issued by Legislative, he assured.
The possibility of a discount "vote by vote" in Michoacán is analysed
According to data highlighted by PREP, difference enters the first and second place of the election of the governor is only 27 for one hundred, even without counting corresponding polls in 879 of 6 thousand and 74 complete minutes.
The possibility of discount "vote by vote" is a reality as regards electoral trial this year in Michoacán, where according to data highlighted by the Programme of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between the first one and the second place of the election of the governor is only 27 for one hundred, even without counting corresponding polls in 879 of 6 thousand and 74 complete minutes.

On the same November 9th, the Supreme Court of justice of the Nation (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversy promoted by Power Legislative place and described as to be " disabled and illegal " the vote of the deputy of the state for re-form them constitutional, because he doesn't have the right to punish them "or to question them".
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote", María of los Á ngeles Llanderal declared that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the County council of IEM it will be possible to accomplish the partial and complete discounts of polls by the local electoral organ.
So, the partial discount of polls, of one or several electoral packets, it is possible that: the results of minutes coincide; there aren't minutes of polls and discount in the file of the ballot box isn't at the president's of this one; or there are errors or obvious impairments of minutes.
Besides, the complete discount of polls received in all ballot boxes of election will be able to be accomplished when there is an indication due to the fact that the difference between the winning supposed candidate of respective election and the one who got the second place in polls is equal or by underside of a point of percentage; on the condition of that at the beginning of session exists an express petition of the representative of the party and/or alliance which introduced the second of the signalled candidates.
The complete discount of polls can come true also if at the end of common discount it results that the difference between the winning supposed candidate and that of the second place is equal or lower in a point of percentage, on the condition of that there is the express petition of the representative of the political party of which the candidate went out second, case in which they will exclude the electoral packets which are object of partial discount.
It is necessary to mention that it is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0,16 pourcent, even without counting the polls of 129 of 923 complete minutes.

The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The indicated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy tomorrow to introduce the new government which will face up one crisis which put this country at the edge of economic disaster
The indicated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet on Wednesday with the president of Italy to introduce the new government which will face up one crisis which put Italy at the edge of economic disaster and jeopardised all Eurozone.
A press release of the presidential palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
They wait that he introduces an office composed in her majorities by the technocrats, even if he am not clear when new executive will take its post.
Monti said that he is going to introduce to the president the result of the dialogues with the political parties in the trial to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult stage", said the ancient European Commissioner to the journalists.
Monti didn't say expressly that he could form a government, but the tone of the comments pointed out that obstacles were overcome.
The "frame is drawn well now", he added.
Monti supplemented process to form a government in less than three days, in more reduced time than normally, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis which pushed the costs of its debt to levels impossible to support.
The new administration run by the ancient European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard packet of austerity demanded by the European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy which had been affected.
By underlining pressure on Monti so that he hurries up, the instability of markets in putting the output of Italian obligations BTP in 10 years over of 7 for one hundred, the level in which Greece and Ireland must duu be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of employers' Italian Confindustria, said in media after his meeting with Monti: "We said that we would support this government a lot".
We think that this Government is the last opportunity so that Italy goes out of this urgent situation.
The possibilities of success of Monti were considerably stimulated by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, in which crisis made resign the passed Saturday.
"We think that efforts of the professor Monti will have a good result", declared to the press Angelino Alfano, right secretary of the party of centre.
The support of PDL, the biggest Italian party, is significant because up to now many its members had opposed to the Government of majority technocrat whom Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to apply what probably will be of re-form austerity unpopular.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could cause new and destructive one attack of financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches added up in pressure by noticing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began the consultations on Monday with the political parties, labour unions and employers' groups and youthful organisations and of women.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday in night.
Monti was named on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorised an extremely quick transition in reply to crisis.
After a short respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi is going to resign, the costs of Italian debt returned now to critical levels between uncertainty on the success of the new prime minister.
To save Italy, with a national debt of 1,9 billions of euro, it would be too much for current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that the Government should persist up to future elections, envisaged for 2013, in spite of predictions generalised on the fact that the politicians will give him only the time to apply re-form them before moving elections forward.
Monti said that he would like to include politicians in the office, but the big parties stress the fact that this one must be only formed by specialists, an indication of their objections in front of a process obliged by financial pressure.
Political sources signalled that reciprocal mistrusts and disagreement between parties complicate trial to include political faces.

A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if 22 calling by both countries for the friendly today's, in 15:05 the hours, with the National Stadium of San José are compared.
While the national champions and from Europe, number one of the monthly classification of FIFA, count an ample register of games inter-choose class A, the Tricolour only has the defender Michael Umana as the only one to have 50 international matches.
This figure was attained the Friday passed in match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play powerful in the League of stars and in the one clubs of Premier League of England, support in year intense one activities in national championships of league and cut and disputes in European cuts as champions League.
For all that it is necessary to add experience with Frenzy Espanola during eliminatory complicating of the European Cut and Worldwide of football.
The Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to a zone, as Concacaf, which is considered of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the bigger record of Spanish Selection is that of the goalkeeper Í ker Casillas, who the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) equated the record of the ancient goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play against the Tricolour today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, cerebral steering wheel of Barcelona, has 106 of it.
Casillas and Xavi were even admitted previous week by UEFA in quoting of other centenaries of the ibérienne team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the centre forward of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of the hundred-year-old figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, two with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
From the direction Costa Rican, and near Michael Umana think she is lateral left Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the kicker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
Thereafter, only five exceeded 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Least.
Those who have it less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain represent Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Á lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
Of the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest even doesn't arrive at 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has one of it only and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still start.
The historical kicker of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has includes the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
""To go to Costa Rica is a dream which brung into being"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bass player Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready for giving one of its best concerts next Sunday on the National Stadium.
They waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream brung into being to occur in this country.
It is because the bass player and founder member Jeff Ament assured, by speaking last week exclusively with Viva, of Brazil.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour of celebration of two working decades and Sunday, 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
That day will come on the National Stadium, from the 19:30 the hours, next to the group of Los Angeles The X and the national of Las Robertas.
It is an extract of dialogue, complete transcription of which is in Nación on Internet.
For his Costa Rican supporters, the fact that Pearl Jam will occur in Costa Rica is a dream brung into being. Are you aware of what your fans live?
To go to Costa Rica is a dream which brung into being for us too.
This one is our second time in South America and Power station and until now it was grandiose.
I passed holiday in Costa Rica only once; it is such a nice country and I think that we will be able to spend some days there.
It émotionne us therefore to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion towards the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fervent supporters?
Thank you for staying next to us during every these years.
21 years were needed so that we arrive at Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so much and we are sorry due to the fact that so much time had to pass up to this concert.
Some persons already say that his concert is the bigger show of the year.
It adds a little of pressure to your visit.
Some of the bigger shows than we gave during last 21 years took place in two last weeks.
We gave one two colossal shows to Sao Paolo and we hope that it shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really very impatient to occur there.
We like this country, we want to go surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries of the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to go surfing?
We have many friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lived in Tamarindo and waves are incredible there.
My friends always went to go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in quoting of Mexico, big places are to go surfing; that's how we learnt him, across the races who like the surfing.
By seeing tour, aves you given by the huge shows, with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never occurred there, we have no restriction as regards what we can make.
We will try to make the best possible show, with a big variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs of every album and to give to our fans a good and various directory.
You never repeat the directory.
In what owes it?
I think that it is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, it is for it that it is very difficult to choose which songs to interpret every party.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we didn't interpret any more since for a long time, it helps us to remain concentrated and surprises us because it reminds us of reasons for which we liked these songs and what we can have forgotten.
It makes that show is more interesting for us and as a result I think that it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
By looking behind, is it difficult to believe all that you achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
Above all, I think that none of us had imagined who we alloy to form a big group rock, and fact that we have made it for more than 20 years makes that it seems to be a dream.
We continue telling our blessings and fact to be able to continue practising music together émotionne us a lot.
We like each other and we love creating music.
We are lucky to go to places of the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things couldn't go better for us.
What means for you fact to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It was always a honour for us to form part of this group of big groups.
We are very friend of people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement comes into sight from a group of friends and is not very common.
From time to time, a group comes into sight from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups go out at the same time of the same city.
We are proud and it is a honour for us to form part of the group of Seattle.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
The last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to be still friend of all them and it is a honour for us to form part of this sound of Seattle which has comes into sight.
It is as very strange as a group as your stays united and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us were together during 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only it is much more time that many groups last normally.
Above all, I think that we are all lucky to be still living and, in second place, we are all concerned for others.
We are friend intimate and favour has it there are musical boulevards which give freedom to each to experiment.
We have confidence some in others with the music of each and it couldn't go better.
Your relation with word publicity wasn't easy; however, thanks to your success, you could make what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure due to the fact that we don't pass too much time in tour because it is easy to fall in this game of big multitudes and of people who like your music.
If they don't forget that people are for music, it there help us not to forget that it is necessary to respect music and what brought it, without taking into the head the fact that they are famous and a rock star, what really interests to none of us.
How do you remember your other plan, Mother Love Bone?
I think that we wrote good songs and at the beginning it was grandiose.
We were a group during almost three years and we didn't publish a disc before of the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of frustrations as the fact that it lasted so not much and the most important the fact is that we are still very friend of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who began in the group with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the incredible person that Andy was and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure of working, laugh, dialect of music, of football and of a lot other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we lack.
Le groupe Las Robertas national ouvrira le montrent le Costa Rica à.
It is true that you know her job, especially Eddie Vedder and for it you chose her as the opening?
Yes, production sent us videos with different proposals and that one was the group which we most liked, therefore we are impatient to see what Las Robertas can give straight and it must be very entertaining.
For what always change you the words of direct Yello Ledbetter?
L'évaluation de Celle-ci une la question verse le Rédacteur (Eddie Vedder), donc je ne sais pas.
It is it who sings it and I think that he makes him with the first words which he imagines.
As bass player, what is his influence?
There is so much...
Parmi les premiers ministres dont je moi souviens il y un Maître d'hôtel Geezer, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Mandrin Dukowski...
There is so much influence, which I could speak every in the afternoon on the bass players whom I love.
How succeeded Pearl Jam the grunge in spite of the fact has support noticing that this one isn't any more fashionable?
I think that we all smell us a bit disconnected from grunge word.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the groups which I have just mentioned, as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have comes into sight at the same time and, if it is recovering now, I think that it is marvellous, because it is a music which is worth listen and groups as Mudhoney make now the best music that never.
At the beginning, his music had contents more obscure and supporting this one became more positive.
In what owes this change?
It is interesting, because I think that there are songs in the new album which seem lighter, but there are songs also, as The End and qualified Just Breathe as very obscure songs, even if these can ring a bit positive.
With two, when Ed played them for me, I mourned when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you grow and there is a traumatism in your life and you lose to a parent or friend, these things begin influencing your art and your music and these songs, undoubtedly, represent it for me.
I also think that it is also possible to be happy and even just like that it is possible to make obscure music.

On commercial plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Treaty of Free Trade (TLC) which augmented the exchange of property between both nations.
The plumber with a moustache passes to three dimensions with "Great Mario 3D Land"
Great Mario struggled, tireless, during 25 years to save to the princess Peach of the labels of the villain Bowser, but he had never made him in three dimensions: in "Great Mario 3D Land" he will struggle for the love of the young person in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at the shops of everybody, was conceived from the beginning to exploit well the characteristics of the mobile console Nintendo 3DS, who allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say as must work stereoscopy without glasses", declared the representative for press specialised from Nintendo to Spain, Omar Á lvarez, during the presentation of video game in Madrid.
Á lvarez pointed out that "Great Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo conceived initially for this support", because until now successes as "Star Fox terrier 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was adaptations of existent titles.
The spokesperson of Nintendo supported that, to be 3D there, "Great Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game which allows a quick and fluid part.
Á lvarez maintained that "Great Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less clever users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to make a "second turn" at the levels of game, who this time are more difficult.
Besides, the users will be able to choose real on time between one "D aggressive" or one who only affects the depth of action, but it would be necessary of cheek in three dimensions to be able to overcome different challenges and "to succumb to optic phantasms".
This incursion of Great Mario in three dimensions also assumes the return of the character to a mobile console, made which didn't take place any more since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a twinkle to the supporters of saga and repeats the previous expression of success of games, which consists due to the fact that the plumber with a moustache must go through platforms mined of dangers to liberate to the princess Peach.
Even if I player finds novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in cases of "playable" Luigi.

Everything seems to point out that the nightmare which the inhabitants of the number 51 of Street Balmes lived came to an end.
Twelve persons left at midday yesterday voluntarily the building which they occupied illegally and where they organised micro-holidays which despaired the neighbours, by order judicial and without necessity of an intervention of the police.
At the end of operation the bolt of the door was changed to avoid that situation is repeated.
"From this day there will be a control of access", should assert the administrator.

Her owner, Maria Pantinat explained for Europa Press where from the occupation of the building her affair lowered one 80 %.

Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the opportunity of convocation beyond debate on fee
The local competition on 16 doors opens once again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Towards the middle of the years '80, in full peak of already - put out Underground Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed small posters of promotion of Collserola.
The booklet defined the mountain as the big park of underground Barcelona.
Besides, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Exchange Park of New York.
With the death of CMB, in 1987, the park became once again, in the imagination of many people, limits it superior of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one who doesn't turn on the north-south axle, otherwise high (mountain) - bottom (sea).
The skills of Collserola as nature park are to the advantage of this idea.
Reference wasn't more Central Park otherwise Yellowstone, with boars in the role of the bear Yogi.
It was situation until, in September, the city council called a mega-competition composed by 16 competitions for all doors of access to Collserola.
A door delays at the idea of park, unquestionably.
That's exactly, or somebody wants to put doors in the field.
Apparait question all alone: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, so much as regards its organisation as as regards reflexion on the city is a topic of dialogue of all architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent topic about which two members of this ancient clique of elected representatives speak when they recognise themselves in a lift.
And it is just one of the rare opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who came there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: competition is opportune.
For Roldán, having approached the forehead coastal "it is necessary" to discuss "the forehead of mountain" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of patties of green houses wasn't led at the end.
"It is necessary to leave the base that the more sprawling park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for his big accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", gave the verdict the architect for whom title of "doors of Collserola" contains one " lexical trap ": you should be necessary think to these "as accesses to a park, but demarcation of some zones in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies proposal as " intellectual challenge " with " some dangers ".
Dangers which divert of "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in years '80 and which had in the zone of the Forum "its song of swan".
First fright is the own demarcation of borders on which it is possible to construct.
"To limit something means to establish already the following step", that is to say, his overtaking.
"It is necessary to think of new urbanistic instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to Underground General Plan (PGM)] can cause authentic disasters".
More held in question, Modol opine where, by simplifying, the mountainside of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not".
Modol reminds that it already exists a job makes by the Employers of Collserola which "shouldn't be lost", by thanking for opportunity that the city council offers to its corporation to intervene in this plan "from the first instant".
Besides, he hears that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the safe-conduct which allows to the architects to enter debate, but the "doubt " if it profiles technology is necessary run the multiple-subject teams (" the whole success ", he says) that they have to create: "Us, the architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question which gives the title of this room is complex, because bases of competition a total vision of Collserola is missing: "16 transverse competitions - were called he says - in sense mountain-sea, but there is no longitudinal reading which sees and includes the zone as a whole".
This makes, at least in that case, that he opts for participating in 16 competitions.
In another way, a plan so that one of the doors could shock in the programme and definition with that of the architect of the neighbouring door.
In its opinion, yes, the city council should guarantee that the immediately upper band to that of Ronda de Dalt should envisage, in all its extension, a zone of equipment which performs a soft transition between the city and the green.

Dispersion of the rests of the plane in a reduced zone:
The available information until now allows to assume that has an impact on it took place on a right and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersion of the rests of the plane allows to assume that the helicopter collided against the soil in conditions of structural integrity.
Traces of fire or of explosion weren't discerned:
In the place of the disaster there is still no trace in the rests of the plane of a type of explosion or fire.
The last results of investigation point out that the plane had had numerous contacts with the soil.
During fieldwork rooms of the plane at a height of 9 thousand and 200 200 feet above the mean sea level were found, the soil introduced a slope which goes since seven dégrées to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he possibly contorted itself during his itinerary.
Information gives elements which seem to point out that the helicopter can have had of have an impact numerous with the soil.
After meticulous research in a zone more ample than the encircled place, around accident, rooms weren't found disperse the plane, what supports presumption of that impact took place in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the gene of obesity
Social Insurance runs an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of the children and young people; this is supported by specialists of the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) announced that he runs an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people, called protocol 'Genetics of the obesity of the children and teenagers' which will allow to have markers linked to the overweight.
In a press release, the leader of the Unit of Medical Investigation in Biochemistry of the Hospital of the Specialities of the National Health centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that one multiple-subject team of doctors had been formed, nurses, nutritionists and attend social.
This team is supported by specialists and students of third cycle of the National Institute of Public health (INSP) and of the Centre of Investigation and of Moved forward Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
To investigation they invite to participate the having population or not straight, to come in sports units participants of the IMSS to Valle de México, where is made proof to the miners every Saturday from 8:00 the hours.
He underlined that the protocol began in Unit sportswoman Cuauhtémoc (Estado de México Poniente) and that from October 8th, activity takes place in Unit sportswoman de Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
Having reached target to unite 500 or 600 miners, study will go on in Unit sportswoman Independencia (in the south of Distrito Federal) and finally in Unit sportswoman Morelos (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that e connaitre components and importance of genetics as regards the development of obesity and to identify at the children's and Mexican young people of risk factors to tell the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
As they will celebrate on November 14th the worldwide Day of Diabeteses, he mentioned that objective is that to unite three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of the specific questionnaires relating to feeding.
One will ask also on their physical activity and their antecedents of family heredity of their diseases for them, to avoid risk factors which launch affections as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He detailed that every Saturday weight, size, circumference of size will be applied to all participants of measuring anthropométriques (), arterial pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycérides, cholesterol and insulin and genetics (they try to identify people linked to infantile obesity).
Cruz López signalled that this investigation is the fruit of the preoccupation of the professionals of health for frightening weighty taking in the case of the miners.
'The inquiries of health of 1999 and 2006 signalled that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of the boys, of 77 for one hundred in obesity and in the case of the girls of 47 for one hundred; as regards the overweight a dramatic increase was also noticed', underlined the specialist of the IMSS.
He pointed out that the justification for the research of markers is based due to the fact that the population of the country differs from others by its genetic history.
He informed that on average, the Mexican have one 65 as one hundred indo-American heredities, one 30 for one hundred European and one five for one hundred Africain and this condition is reflected in people linked in diabeteses and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity is translated in inability of bruler the excess of energy that they consume that (calories), which settles in the form of grease.
The researcher explained that the benefit direct for the participants it is the entire valuation of the children, what allows to discern if they introduce a degree of overweights or of obesity.
Ila having even said as the presence of the creases of dark colour (Acanthosis) on the neck and the forearm point out likelihood to suffer from metabolic impairments and even pre-diabeteses.
Information is managed in a confidential way, the doctors delay it in writing to the parents, they explain each measures to which of and changes in the lifestyle which they have to accomplish to tell diseases.
Cruz López explained that there is three main components who cause overweight, obesity and other chronic affections: the sédentarisme, which is the lack of daily physical activity, to remain most day sat in front of the television and to use means of transport instead of walking on short distance.
Another reason is the high caloric intake, that is to say the biggest consumption of sweet drinks, hydroxides of carbon (tamales - patty of meat in the flour of corn enveloped in leaves of corn - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high contents of grease and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
The asphalt of UNAM would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt changed with polymers to produce a mixture with a better output, independently of environmental conditions and of temperature
If signal it that the paving were solved, it wouldn't be necessary any more to repair about 200 thousand blackcurrants every wet season in the Metropolitan area of Valle de México, informs Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintenance of the bituminous paving is adequate, blackcurrants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During its conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organised as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt changed with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those some asphalt, but with a bigger mechanical resistance, so much to high as low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera thought that this type of changed asphalt could be used in places in which climate is extremely hot, as some cities from the north of the country, to improve output, and as a result, training of blackcurrants.
He explained that the asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is group of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltènes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together give its characteristics to the paving viscoélastique behaviour.
Behaviour viscoélastique some asphalt consists of the fact that in high temperatures, of about 180 degrees, its viscosity acts as a liquid, to 120 degrees C am very big and to 50 degrees C he introduces an almost solid state, while in very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
It means that on streets the resistance of the asphalt isn't uniform and changes during day according to environmental conditions and to temperature, informs the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ noticed that the streets of Ciudad de México in their majority were covered by a flexible paving, composed of six layers of materials, among which three last implicate the asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the layer of asphalt, formed by small bathed stones asphalts it and compactées later.
Each of the small stones that forms the layer, he should signal, is bathed a year asphalt.
When vehicles pass to it by generating efforts, this one allows that force spreads very well in the paving.
If they had some changed asphalt, these would spread better, opinât to try hard it chemical.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, they put a last layer called layer of rotation, made stone fine, that is to say, of some sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this one is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, she must have more mechanical force than the layer of asphalt and give sticking on the street.
Being the part of the paving which receives and distributes efforts, the layer of rotation also demands that this one has an adequate thickness and a material which it is made is necessary be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and variations of temperature, are also a factor very important to consider, especially the water, he says, because these affect considerably the output of the layer of asphalt.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer it is am difficult that this one goes out, what softened all layers of the paving and as a result reason of blackcurrants.
In the trial of training of a blackcurrant, he says, the first one which spoils the layer of asphalt is the film of rotation and only later affected, but damage doesn't take place immediately, but it is a process which must be treated in the first signals with adequate programmes of maintenance.
The member of the National System of the Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another factor mattering for the training of blackcurrant and as a result the thickness of every layer of the paving is always necessary be linked payable by vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, to avoid the frequent training of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera informed that there is still a lot to investiguer and to work bituminous emulsions on the asphalt, for example, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What missed to the candidate of Valle to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors who made that Melina Ramírez Serna doesn't get miss's crown Colombia.
Valle receives the title number 14 of princess.
Once again Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to earn miss's crown Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content himself with fact to be on the catwalk of the winning, to carry the crown of money and the band which accredits him as new princess of Colombia.
With the result got yesterday evening in Cartagena, where miss Atlántico went up with the crown and the sceptre, the department commands already 14 titles of Princess and Melina if one in a feminine legion of Valle del Cauca who was near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, between who Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Á lvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question which a lot of people asks is:
What was missing? Because result represents the defeat of a big favourite that in every presentation showed that it had it everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she hadn't been elected in vain Reine de la Police and Better Face Jolie de Vogue, pretty of titles got by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took miss's crown Colombia.
The first key considered factor in the decision taken by the juror to indicate it First Princess is the fact that she didn't persuade with her answer to question"? What was the book which marked you and why? put down by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the answer of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think that it is a form to culturaliser, definitely I think that the book which marked my childhood is " The small prince ", it is a rather deep book.
Currently I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature which we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, one Russian, a very nice book which is called "ardour of blood"".
This answer doesn't have plait first of all because of term "to culturaliser" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how every named book had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she felt quiet and happy with result "the world and sage, there happens what must take place.
And for everybody, read please a bit, " The small prince " is a big book"
Between thrown hypotheses there is that according to who Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota insinuated that being the favourite, the greeting with wide applause and the candidate who received all preliminary prices (challenge of gastronomy Oster, the vote of the public for the best craft costume, and Queen mother), "it awakened the jealousy of other candidates, put the queen on edge and it is for it that she didn't shine on the stage".
And it in his first presentation in swimsuit in the beach of Hilton and its two parades of the day before coronation wasn'ted.
Even if in both parades she had seemed sure of herself even, they noted that she had no force and the energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "CoMb put it" (As at home), of the Channel RCN declared that the fact that Melina had been indicated princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets competition most prices during doesn't receive queen's crown".
Besides, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was one error.
Another hypothesis it is because Valle didn't succeed in persuading jury on the interest for social initiatives, which is in fact the petrol of the National Competition of Beauty.
It is for it that two days before election the international swearing Lucy Doughty declared that they searched a woman hired as regards social necessities of her country.
"Only beauty isn't sufficient at a Miss's Colombia, it is necessary to look beyond physical appearance and to centre on his social sensitivity, that before beginning Competition are already involved in plans", she explained.
They speculate as as Valle sinned by the defects of sound behind and the fibrose who watched each other in its abdomen, but it is contradictory, because precisely jury elected him as the candidate ' natural Beauty ' with the healthier body, good feeding and responsible physical job.
Reconnait queens' preparatory Jorge Hernán Orozco that Melina had no best body, that there was it better, "but the problem of fibrose on the abdomen, who in reality for me hadn't been too well-known, shone left points last day".
Meantime the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle surgical operations were that she had suffered.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't make them.
Her body has never been her trump and she lost because of this aspect".
For this price, which the National Competition of Beauty delays for the first time, after parade in swimsuit has comes into sight one cruel prediction which was fulfilled yesterday evening, they said that it was a small present which Raymundo gave in Melina not to give him the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins one year of reign, not as sovereign, otherwise as princess, today a position which gives him the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of National Competition.
However, she will pass in the history as one of the queens which in spite of sound dazzling passage by Cartagena, didn't get the crown.
So the job of the person of Cali was who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A dactyloscopiste of Cali passed to history as man who confirmed the death of '"Alfonso Cano'.
The job of these civil servants is crucial.
Past November 4th a dactyloscopiste of CTI of Cali passed to history as person who confirmed the identity of the commander in chief of Farc: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of CTI, this week it was the turn of "availability' of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who works for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipes of Shock ó, where a lot of times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place in which were bodies qu had to be identified.
Year 2000 it became transferred to the capital of Valle and having does adequate courses, it specialised in dactyloscopie, which is the study of the skin of friction, that is to say palms and feet.
During the week of operation against alias Alfonso Cano they had informed in Eliazar to take clothes with him at least for three days.
Something very big waited for him.
On Friday at night he left for Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that they suspected that one of them was that of the man who ran the more ancient guérrilla of the world, as a result they asked him to lose temper the card with ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (its true name).
But when he arrived with the team of investigation towards the body, he didn't admit him by his physical aspect, because this one very differred from the one that he had seen in media.
He didn't have beard, he was dressed as a peasant of the zone, without glasses and much thinner.
But footprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a magnifier galtonienne, of some ink, a préleveur and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with those of the card.
The eye deceived him not: it was of '"Alfonso Cano".
The same night, the man native to Puerto Tejada was the representative who confirmed to the minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, it was about the commander in chief of Farc.
In search of footprint
For a dactyloscopiste of Sijín of Cali the recognition that the president Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for operation against "Cano", am very significant.
Many people of connait not our job.
The dactyloscopie is a precise science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart to identify bodies, dactyloscopistes supports investigations for offences as flight and the homicide and confirms the identity of the captured persons.
When are captured, many delinquents introduce wrong identity cards or don't have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in database.
The researcher narrated that in a case of flight he had to take away a part of wall of a home, because in this place the thief had supported the hand to get outside a safe full of jewellery and money.
"Walls are difficult because they aren't adequate areas to draw fingerprints, but in that case we could get the footprint of all hand and identify with the delinquent who had participated in different flights", he remembers.
Footprints can also move aside or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently a dead man, with bottles of drink around him was found.
By interlude of investigation they determined that a parent can be suspicious of crime and indeed a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it no guarantees not that he is the murderer, it puts him on the stage of crime.
A dactyloscopiste of CTI explained that they extract "the fingerprints of objects with one reactive chemical or physical".
When they appear, a préleveur or a band are used to take a sample of them.
Subsequently, footprints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or to the National Civil Register.
"Problem is that there are some more Colombians without papers", pointed out the expert of the CTI.
He explained that everything isn't how they show in TV programme CSI.
As all that shines isn't gold, everything that is touched forcing doesn't become a footprint.
She can however be used, if necessary confrontation is accomplished.
The "indignant" outbrave authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators bumped into each other in front of the place Zuccotti to camp there.
A lot of the persons achieved the order of evacuation and moved in a neighbouring park.
The integrant of movement Occupy Wall Street outbraved on Tuesday the authorities of New York by trying to re-enter, thanks to a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, where from they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators bumped into each other in front of the place Zuccotti, where they wanted to achieve thanks to a judicial order which allows the 'indignant ' to camp once again in this place, while the other part of movement answered evacuation by occupying a park more north of the city, where there was new stopping.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp once again in the place, we are going to become established in another place and we will continue lawful struggle to go back in Zuccotti, and in foible sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", says one of the doors-words of movement "Occupies Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the answer of the 'indignant ' to the evacuation of their camp dictated personally by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, arrived up to courts, where the judge Lucy Billings issued a command which forbade the evacuation forced by the place and allowed to the demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Besides, the 'indignant ' occupied a new park located in the confluence of power stations Channel Street and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance in the tunnel Holland, which joins New York and New Jersey, property of the parish Trinity Church.
At least during one hour they succeeded in occupying the place, but after the Police moved there and stopped some demonstrators, even if Bray couldn't confirm the concrete figure, by assuring Efe due to the fact that he saw some journalists to which handcuffs had been also passed.
The organisation assures that there are centenaries of persons who had become established in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of movement and tried to intervene in favour of them in front of the Police.
Meantime, the place Zuccotti - which is a surrounding wall of private property - rest closed by waiting for the celebration of a judicial audience envisaged by this Tuesday during which it is necessary to analyse the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some displaced demonstrators until then carried and distributed at this hour the copies of this judicial order and they delivered it even to the agents who watched the place, what caused ' some small clashes ', pointed Bray out, who reported the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
Judicial order forbids to the authorities to evacuate the members of Occupe Wall Street or to apply 'laws published after the beginning of occupation or to forbid to the demonstrators to achieve the park once again with tents or other properties which they used before'.
The mayor Bloomberg pointed out in front of the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and to the demonstrators, to which he however alerted due to the fact that local laws don't allow them to become established with tents and bags to sleep.
The town councillor defended evacuation personally accomplished at dawn on the place Zuccotti, an operation during which they arrested that 200 persons and on that one decided because of fact that the demonstrators 'violated law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given order to evacuate the place because this one became "a place in which the persons came to protest, but to violate laws and in certain cases, to harm other persons", because "some shops had received threats" and the inhabitants were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation of this morning at dawn was creepy and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested to defend financial interests than those of the American workers", added the spokesperson of movement, who accused the mayor "of not respecting the freedom of expression".
The representatives of "Occupy Wall Street" also pointed out that they don't think to organise " big actions " for Thursday in collaboration with the Community organisations and the labour unions to memorialise two months of protest, who began on September 17th.
Pamela Anderson will be the virgin Mary in Noel's special TV programme
In quoting of Michael Bublé and others Canadian famous, she will go out in TV programme "It' s has Russell Peters Christmas" on the next December 1st
The sheepskin-lined jacket Pamela Anderson was the helper of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", first-aid worker in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of the musician of rock Tommy Lee and now, the actress and models the virgin Mary in Noel's special programme of Canadian television will be.
The channel deprived of television CTV has announced today that Anderson, in quoting of " crooner " (baladin) Michael Bublé and of others Canadian famous, will go out in TV programme "It' s has Russell Peters Christmas" next interpreting December 1st one very special virgin Mary.
CTV had distributed pictures of TV programme today in who Anderson, known also for the ample broadcasting on Internet of one pornographic video deprived in which she appeared with its spouse of this epoch, the percussionist of apparait "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, dressed as the virgin Mary by supporting in a day nursery a doll which represents to Jesus.
In the stage, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who has introduced a part recently of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, apparait come Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, the special programme of Noel de CTV also introduces the Canadian singer Bublé, which at the end of March married in Buenos Aires models her Argentinian Luisana Lopilato, and that is not far from controversies itself.
Recently, Bublé called 'prostitute ' the American Kim Kardashian during one of the concerts in New York.
Renait Japan after the earthquake
The GDP raises one 1,5 % thanks to consumption domesticates and puts an end to the spiral of fall of the beginning of March
Since March Japanese economy thought it was paralysed, it was convalescent even after destructive earthquake which became nuclear crisis, the worst disaster of the Japanese country since World War II.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo calculated material losses in 300.000 millions dollars, a blow which, in spite of difficult worldwide context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the data of the Gross domestic product between July and September served to turn over a new leaf definitely: the GDP raised one 1,5 % in comparison with the previous quarter and one 6 % in annualisé rate.
That recorded the second quarter - for Japanese, the tax year begins in March, 2012 - assumes, on top of that, the biggest rhythm of increase since period from January till March, 2010.
Recovery explains, partly, by the resumption of the acquisitions of equipment to restore zones devastated by the earthquake and posterior tsunami.
Indeed, firms augmented their investments by 1,1 %, in comparison with fall of 0,9 % expenses of capital noticed from January till March, the first detachment after six months of non-interrupted increase.
However, truth stimulate Japanese economy is exclusively based on the impulse Keynesian which invites to use crisis to consolidate - or to rebuild - facilities, to use deficiencies for croitre of zero.
Japan woke up especially thanks to the evolution of the domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 % Japanese GDPS.
This variable raised a 1 %, pushed by the increase in expenses on vehicles, trips and activities of entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo recovered in the home market when the yen - the currency Japanese - became one of "stocks shelter" elected by the investors who escape the crisis of debt in eurozone and disturbances United predictions of States, a privilege which weighs as a slab in the count of the exporting companies.
With separate stronger one, products are more expensive abroad, a serious back for a country the line of economic wavering of which is determined by the health of the big technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, made responsible for their weak results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While markets continue their seats in the peripheral countries of EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda doesn't lower the nurse.
"It is necessary to follow risks which persist, as the deterioration of some foreign savings, the impact of the inundations of Thailand and the quick evaluation of the yen", signalled yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And really, perspectives are encouraging in no way.
The Organisation for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of the countries members introduced in September the more clear signals of economic slowing down.
The indicator which anticipates the inflexion points of worldwide economy threw into relief that main powers are slowed down.
Because this one lowered four decimals up to 100,4 points, in comparison with 100,8 in aout.
Eurozone was even underneath the average, which is in level 100, n lowering eight decimals up to 99,13 points.
Athens feeds doubts once again
Papadimos says that adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will sign no written commitment
With the launched peripheral risk premiums and the uncertainty re-installed in parks, Greece continues getting tangled up in the maze which drives to the exit of the big crisis of European debt.
Feeling of that the "consensus" of the new Government of hellène transition is rather imposed by requirements of Brussels than by real conviction of political force begins being confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos signalled yesterday that there isn't alternative for re-form them structural and that period of hundred days establishes in his designation will be is possible be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he is going to support the new measures of austerity under no circumstances and iterated his requirement of new elections for the envisaged date, that of February 19th.
"The main task of this Government is that to apply decisions of the summit of October 26th", declared Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate which will finish with a vote of confidence for new Executive tomorrow.
A packet of 24 programmes to stimulate job, re-forms her of disciplinary code of the civil servants and news measures against tax escape the first initiatives will be.
However, the message of Samaras no clears doubts on its position: "We promised to help the Government of transition, but we got involved in nothing furthermore".
The conservatif leader went a step farther to his pulse than EU and IMF, the organisms which have to release 8.000 millions which Athens requires with emergency, and said clearly that he will approve no letter of commitment of realisation of adjustments.
But the European Commission, irritated still by has an impact on him caused by the everything of the referendum of Papandreu, iterated yesterday that its requirement is business company: he will release assistant if the new Government and the leaders of the main hellènes parties don't sign "a written commitment without ambigüités as early as possible".
The spokesperson of Economic Business, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the troika would go back " very quickly " in Athens to discuss with the new Government "the necessary elements to pay the sixth edge" of 8.000 millions, even if there is a final date either.
The Greek have still a lot to make.
The queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen underlines the "preponderant" place of Spain as regards this type of finances
Spain "attained a preponderant place at worldwide level in the role of Micro-finances".
The queen Sofía reminded that the country became in these two last decades the second donor of the planet as regards this instrument of cooperation " the petrol " of which domiciles due to the fact that this one is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated Vth World summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with certainty yesterday that '"he doesn't doubt there" that this type of operations are "absolutely necessary" to reach the Targets of the Millennium established by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one who has the reduction as purpose in the middle of the volume of the persons who live with incomes under a dollar a day, to which is fixed the "threshold of poverty".
Spain "continues working" to extend the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and takes this task with "responsibility", signalled the queen Sofía, who hoped that initiatives and contributions origins during the Summit, who will persist until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and of opportunities better for the poorest and especially for the women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We "reached a lot of targets" and "we are made facing a lot of challenges".
The Summit of Microcredit is envisaged not only as a for of debate, but also as the platform has leave which it is necessary to impulser " two basic purposes ".
So, Her Majesty explained that objective is that at the end of 2015 there is 175 million poor families which achieved these financial services and which hundred millions of these families take out from the threshold of poverty in which they live now.
The impulse in the conception of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the initiated track there is pioneer some years of a way" by Muhammad Yunus, underlined the queen Sofía as a "act of justice and owed recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "marvellous idealist in the universal reason of struggle counters poverty", job of which it connait since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh for connaitre on the ground her politics of loans.
This experience was followed one year later by the first World summit in Washington and other meetings as those celebrated in the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "on every meeting I could determine an uninterrupted evolution", explained Her Majesty, from whom the relation with this plan brought him the qualifier of "head of the family " united in Valladolid to fork out "of poor people yesterday".
Finally, the queen Sofía finished her intervention by encouraging the attendees to participate in debate and in research of solutions to advance in the struggle against poverty.
" Ethical imperative"
The minister of External Business, Trinidad Jiménez, informed that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic State.
In this sense, it displayed that it would be an error of vinculer cooperation with developing countries in epochs of economic prosperity, because this one is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits assume "a serious and strict politics devoted to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever " the governments of the developed countries have to work under criteria of solidarity and leave not that this one is the victim of compression.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded success " to give "confidence" to the persons "excluded to which all close the door"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomeed attendees in a city which "opens its doors polluted by united mind".
CDU offers to elect the European president to universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14th, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democrat party.
The future of Europe wasn't initially envisaged in the programme but was obvious to autumn, notably to satisfy the activists who judge the politics of the too lax government in relation to the Greeks today and perhaps Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, offered by direction, was adopted in almost unanimity.
On 1001 delegates, only new voted against and for ten refrained.
Social status ovation of several minutes to which had the right, at the end of their interventions, Angela Merkel then, some hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, europhile very Minister of Finance, didn't leave place in doubt.
The topping idea of the chancellor - and motion - holds in a slogan: the answer to crisis "is no less than Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe, it is peace but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "the time came from a breakthrough in Europe".
It could be translated by modifications in the treaty of Lisbon allowing to reinforce the control of the European Union of the fiscal policies of the countries of the euro area, but it could also result in the election of the president of the European Commission in universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe".
Such is anyway one of the proposals of motion adopted by the congress the initiator of which is apparently Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that Twenty-seven agree fast about this revolution: Great Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is it also.
But milestone is put down.
Also, the delegates rejected proposal to an overwhelming majority to balance the weight of every country to the board of directors of the European central Bank according to the weight of every economy, what of course returned to reinforce the weight of Germany.
Anxious with appeasing climate inside her party, the chancellor multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and to Helmut Kohl Mais she either didn't try to earn her congress on the back of the "small" European countries or of the in trouble prompt countries to criticise arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of French-German friendship ", Angela Merkel didn't recall France.
Safe in hollow.
By reminding that the two centuries ago, Leipzig had been in the middle of bloody battle.
Indeed, it was one of the most mortifying undoing of the napoleonic army.
What represents the fraud to stopping illness?
After benefits, UMP and government throw offensive on stopping illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, November 15th in Claret to visit a Social Security Office, and to pronounce a speech on topic - recurrent since 2007 - of the struggle against social fraud and assistantship.
And to accompany this offensive, which leaves a will to make savings in an essential context, but is not less warning of an axle of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority want to concentrate on stopping illness.
First in a purpose of budgetary savings: the government plans to impose on the wage earners of the private a fourth day of deficiency before the taking care of a stoppage of work.
Clearly, without agreement of specific firm, a wage earner who falls ill would lose four days of wage, therefore at least 15 % of his monthly income.
A measure which risks provoking anger, but that would allow to bring back 280 million euro, according to Echoes.
And who would be accompanied with another measure, with more symbolic range: impose on the civil servants a day of deficiency not indemnified in case of stoppage of work (they don't have waiting period until now, against three days in private life).
While these questions are under discussion, the majority also restart the themes of fraud, targeting this time abuses linked to stoppage of work.
"Controls are going to be much more important and, on top of that, if you are taken, you will reimburse", informed Xavier Bertrand in the microphone of RTL, Sunday, November 13th.
As for other cases, the effects of announcement seem a little disproportional with the reality of fraud to stoppage of work.
This one indeed makes the object since 2002 of a constant monitoring and political offensives, which most often carried their fruits.
Frenchmen no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let's delay us first on the national figures.
According to the national Case of health insurance (CNAM), more than 237 million euro of sick pays were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of research and of material in economy of health, sick pays represented health in 2008 5 % expenses of, with 11,3 thousand million euro.
On this sum, 46 % concerned maternity leaves and industrial accidents, and 54 % concerned stopping illness, that is 6,2 thousand million euro.
And therefore 2,5 % expenses of health.
In 2010, Frenchmen knew on average 14,5 days of stoppage of work, against 17,8 in 2009, according to a study of the group Alma Consulting.
An average which hides certain distances: another inquiry, published in 2007 by the site of management of career Monster.com, showed that 75 % 40 000 questioned French wage earners told it had taken no day of stopping illness.
Another study, this time of the Health insurance, adds that in 2010, 37 % of stopping illness were of a lower length in 8 days, 22 % from 8 to 14 days, 15 % from 15 days to month, 15 % from one to three months and 11 % beyond.
When they are compared with their European neighbours, the wage earners Frenchmen aren't more disposed than elsewhere in stoppage of work.
A long study led in 2010 by two researchers of the NATIONAL CENTRE FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of total absence (for health reasons or not) wobbled, in France, between 10 % and 11 %, against 20 % and 28 % in Denmark, 15 % in the United Kingdom or 16 % and 18 % in the Netherlands.
Fraud in stopping illness represents little facing illicit work.
As for fraud, she attains only a weak largeness.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 makes that controls are systematic on stopping illness of more than 45 days.
In 2008, on 1,5 million controls, CNAM noted that 13 % 285 000 accomplishing for short-term stopping was "unjustified or too long", is 37 050 cases.
In the case of the stopping of more than 45 days, systematically controlled, 11 % of " maladjusted or unjustified" cases on 1,2 million, they that is 132 000 were counted.
In total, therefore 169 000 "unjustified" cases, on several million wage earners having had a stopping illness.
A figure which represents face very little, for example, to that of illicit work.
According to DEPUTY UMP DOMINIQUE TIAN, author of a report on question in June, this one would represent 9 - 15 thousand million euro of lack to be earned tax a year, is more than total cost of sick pays, and therefore infinitely more than fraud in these last.
Papadémos: Greece will have to apply a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new programme of adjustment to straighten its economy.
It is what declared on Monday, November 14th the prime minister, Lucas Papadémos, in front of the Parliament, adding that hundred days given to its government of union wouldn't be enough to fulfil this task.
"To follow efforts of rebound of economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new programme of budgetary adjustment", declared the head of government, who pronounced his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence to the Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of decisions taken during the summit of the euro area on October 27th will be the "main task" of the new government, because the participation of the country in the euro area "is in game", he added.
Consequently, Mr Papadémos envisaged that the public deficit of the country will be reduced "around 9 %" by the GDP before end of year, having been 10,6 % in 2010 and 15,7 % in 2009.
Right refuses new measures of austerity
Antonis Samaras, the leader of right, brought on Monday the support of measures already approved to try to go out of the crisis of debt but told that the party wouldn't get involved on an additional austerity.
"We won't vote in favour of new measures", he said during a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He told himself in agreement with the objectives of reduction of deficit and of debt, and of struggle against wastings but hostile to any politics which would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner charged with economic and monetary business, who told that the IMF and the EU wouldn't release the necessary 8 thousand million euro loan without written guarantee of all parties that they would support envisaged measures, Antonio Samaras answered that his word was enough and that he would sign nothing under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
The Canadians live in the denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In palliative care, the committee demands that governments, institutions of healthcare, and doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and it, beyond cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lived in the denial of death.
Only 9 % Canadians indeed agree to speak with their doctor of conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements with this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which participated six experts linked up with various domains, among which ethics, right and medicine.
This committee recommends to the government to change criminal Code in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when this choice is obvious, to a patient considered competent to make such decision.
From the start, the experts name a recent inquiry of Economist Intelligence Joins, who compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada ranked 10th there, study notes that "the médicalisation of death in Canada procreated a culture in which people are afraid to approach the subject of death".
Médicalisation or not, 77 % Canadians don't have access to palliative care, bring to us back the experts delegated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And in spite of the wish which have most Canadians to die at home, 68,6 % of them end up dying in the hospital.
On the whole, from the country, it is in the Quebec where this rate is the highest, with 86 % dead happening in the hospital.
On the delicate question of euthanasia and of assisted suicide, the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which go contrary to the position of the federal government, which has already told he wants to change nothing in the criminal Code concerning euthanasia and assisted suicide.
And yet according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalised or decriminalized, there is no proof that this decriminalization draws abuses away in application, that is to say practice of euthanasia or of suicide assisted on consenting or not not competent persons.
On the contrary, asserted in teleconference yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, more many cases of these excesses precisely in the countries would be found where euthanasia and assisted suicide aren't legalised.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal".
"The assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
The Canadians favourable to euthanasia
Let's remind that 85 % Canadians were already pronounced in favour of euthanasia because they think that she would allow to the persons at the end of life to lighten their suffering, according to an opinion poll Angus Reid was performed in 2010.
And 66 % think that fact to legalise euthanasia won't have the effect of sending the message which the life of the old persons or disabled persons has less value.
As for the persons having practiced the assisted suicide, the polling think at 41 % that they shouldn't be followed.
In maintaining or suspension of care to a patient, situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is pointed out in criminal Code that the withdrawal of care as which there was a legally valid refusal isn't criminal.
The committee of experts also asks that the professionals of health are formed in duty to respect a refusal of care at the end of life, without fearing criminal chases.
In palliative care, the committee demands that governments, institutions of healthcare, and doctors work together to assure better palliative care, and it, beyond cases of cancer.
Finally, in palliative or final sedation, already widely used in the institutions of Canadian health, the committee asks that it is considered, when it doesn't serve for reducing physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of the right of health have already expressed reservations concerning conclusions of the report of the experts of the royal Society of Canada.
Miss Pierre Deschamps, specialist in right of health, described to be '"extreme" the position of the experts signatories of the report, among other things because she doesn't limit the practice of euthanasia to the sick in final stage.
"It opens the door to a situation where each and every one who would be world-weary and who would be more than 18 years old could ask that he is helped to commit suicide", says Miss Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Miss Deschamps underlines as as the authors of the report seem to put the autonomy of the person above all other stocks which participate in the social cloth of the society.
And yet "in society, he says, there are beacons and pressures".
The specialist of the right of health Margaret Somerville as expressed " a strong opposition " to conclusions of the report, as she qualified of "demonstrates pro-euthanizes".
Margaret Somerville, who is member of the Royal Society of Canada herself, questions especially the data of the report as for the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, that is in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls the president Assad to leave power
Damascus reports a "conspiracy"
Syria is more and more isolated
Supporters of al-Assad Bachar demonstrated in front of the places of the ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Diplomatic pressures intensified on Syria of Bachar al-Assad yesterday, which, with the help of Russia, resists them and reports a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union reinforced its sanctions against Damascus while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring of Syria, took position in favour of a departure of the president Assad.
The king Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday to call the al-Assad president Bachar "to leave power" in Syria where quarantine civilians and members of force of regime was again killed.
"If Bachar was keen the interest of the country, he should resign, but he should also create necessary conditions for a new stage of Syrian political life", said the king of Jordan, neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview in BBC.
From his part, the leader of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that efforts of Turkish mediation undertaken since the beginning by the year to Syrian regime end in a failure.
"Those who aren't in peace in the Middle East with their people and can't satisfy them will leave", he declared, alluding in Syria, neighbouring country regarding which Turkey adopts a more and more hard line.
The United States were very pleased for their part about a "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the activities of regime" Syrian, after decisions of the Arab League and of the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries as Turkey adopt a more and more hard tone" facing suppression in Syria, noticed Mark Toner, a spokesperson of the State department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of force of regime perished in the region of Deraa, in the south of Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory of human rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians perished "during exchanges of shooting and of bombardment in the heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the city besieged with Homs, according to this NGO.
During a press conference, Syrian minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem however thought that the country "ran towards the end of crisis".
He besides deeply reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus of his jobs, which constitutes according to him " a dangerous step ".
Syria "won't" "sag", he added, assuring that "conspiracies cooked up against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League studies currently a "mechanism of protection of the civilians" and wishes the dispatch of 500 members of Arab organisations of the rights of the person, of media and of the military observers in the country.
French minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppé also claimed to be favourable to observers' dispatch of the UNO to help to protect the civilians of the suppression of regime which according to him locks itself in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is envisaged tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the situation on the implementation of the plan of exit from crisis decided on November 2nd and notably envisaging the withdrawal of the armed forces of cities in the grip of protest and liberalisation of the stopped demonstrators.
Russian minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergueï Lavrov, considered yesterday "wrong " the decision of the Arab League, while China motivated Syria to implement the plan of exit from crisis, careful not to support possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks of time markets and sacrifices the Italians
The future Italian head of government, Mario Monti, complained a little of time in markets to form his team and to implement a programme, which will contain sacrifices ", to recover the credibility lost in last months of the government Berlusconi.
The ancient European Commissioner was under discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting labour unions and employers today.
He should set up a relatively restrained office composed of external technocrats to the Parliament.
"Monti spoke about a programme mattering with many sacrifices", said Francesco Nucara, deputy of one of many small parliamentary groups hired in discussions, having met the indicated head of government.
The president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, told from his part he expected that Mario Monti solicits by Friday a vote of confidence to the Parliament to make sure which the new government disposes of a sufficient support.
Consultations will end by presentation by Mr Monti of a restrained list, undoubtedly of a dozen of ministers, to the leader of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, by asking them of time.
In "democracy, there are definite delays" to prepare a government and its programme, he underlined, claiming "to be certain that markets will be patient and include".
Its designation by the president had been initially greeted by markets, but concern notably regained the upper hand after an unexpected fall of industrial production in euro area in September.
The indicated prime minister should constitute a team understanding technocrats especially, even if he underlined that he would like to include "politics " there.
The new government must last until 2013, date of the next general elections, he estimated.
According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will get the confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Mr Monti got involved, once took up the post, to work in emergency and with the intention that Italy "becomes again protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn underlined that "even with a new government, our diagnosis on Italian economy doesn't change".
The EU, persuaded that Rome won't reach its target of balance in the budget in 2013 in spite of the plans of austerity adopted these last months, asked notably for new essential measures.
The "patroness of the Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also stressed the necessity to restart economy, "because a country without growth can't respect the parametres of deficit".
Mr Monti, reputed for his competence and his independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconisme", the representing "professor" "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the leader writers.
The big unknown will be the longevity of the team.
The president Napolitano would like to avoid preliminary elections, because Italy must put before April, 2012 for 200 thousand million euro of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped in the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop an usable detonator with a nuclear weapon, asserted on Monday one NGO American specialised in atomic risk.
The Institute for science and international security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the international Agency for atomic security (AIEA) and other documents emanating from this agency of the UNO to identify this researcher.
AIEA announced last week of the "serious concerns" as for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS scooping out widely from documents of born AIEA, Mr Danilenko, in 1934, would have worked during three decades from the sixties in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tcheliabinsk (Ural), and should be involved in the factory of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the centre to establish a firm producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
Economic difficulties of its society would have led him to contact the embassy of Iran in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then have collaborated on the Iranian programme from 1996 till 2002, before his return in Russia.
In its last report, AIEA recalls "strong indications that the development by Iran" of a system of nuclear detonation "was helped by the job of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technology well, but who, as a Member state informed about it the Agency, worked during the basics of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin".
Crimes and anti-Muslim offences augmented by 50 %
Crimes and offences against the Muslims augmented of about 50 % from 2009 till 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious acts of violence slightly went down or not much advanced, according to the statistics of the FBI made public on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence perpetrated against the Muslims passed from 107 to 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is 49 % of increase, against a progress of 13 % of acts of violence against the Catholics, a fall of 4 % offences against the Jews and a total increase in 14 % crimes and anti-religious offences.
The total number of "crimes of hate" very slightly augmented in 6 628 cases, among which 47,3 % motivated by difference of breed and 20 % by difference of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences augmenting once again", underlined the organisation of human rights Human rights First, "the increase of antiMuslim acts of violence is particularly significant", added the organisation in a press release.
"Human Rights First has underlined for a long time that acts of violence against the Muslims, as well as all forms of crimes full of hatred, must be considered to be a serious violation of human rights", adds one of the representatives for the organisation, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must make more to attack these abuses", he adds, thinking that it could pass by an improvement of the reports of police on the "crimes of hate".
The "crime of hate" in American federal right is an inheritance of the epoch of struggle for civil rights.
This legislation had been adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to the breed, the colour of the skin, religion, origin and supporting sexual membership.
Le gazouillement modifie sa plateforme et ressemble plus à Facebook
The site of micro-blogging Twitter introduced changes on Monday into the presentation of its platform, to allow his users notably to notice the activity of those whom they follow, what makes resemble its service a little more to that of Facebook.
A new thumb-index "activity" and another "name" allow to follow more legibly, straight the activity of other "Twittos", the internauts by whom they follow messages (" Tweets ") and those who follow you.
It allows to know if they have followed messages, if they subscribe to new count, if they have favourite messages, etc.
This new expression of Twitter was tested "on users' small percentage in August" before being broadcast in the whole network on Monday, pointed out to the AFP the spokesperson of Twitter, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for the not very instinctive functioning, with a little esoteric terms (RT to repeat a message of somebody else, #followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making happy initiating, opens so to a broader public with a handling more comparable to that of networks general public Facebook and Google +.
On network, the users discussed with "Tweets" cut on the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, intrusive, and this resembles too much in Facebook", written @jemb123.
"Functionality Activity is going to help me to follow better some elements of my flux Twitter", sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inscription of one budgetary "golden rule" in constitution
The Social Democrat-Christian government of big alliance in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to register one in constitution budgetary "golden rule" to reduce public deficit and so to avoid a possible deterioration by the agencies of notation of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
It is the Social Democrat chancellor Werner Faymann who shone even announced this decision at the end of a council of ministers, while the Austrian national debt is 74,6 %, widely above 60 % criterion maximum fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but distinctly downstairs of debts of country as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered only by the single notch, by AAA in AA +, we should pay three thousand million euro of interests in more every year", argued the vice-chancellor and minister Christian Democrat of Foreign affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria so follows up a request of the summit in Brussels of countries members of the euro area of October 26th of this year: the heads of state and heads of government had then claimed inscription before the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficit and of return to the balance of public count in constitution or in law of the same value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government gets closer to the "German model", Germany having been the first European country to adopt such "rule".
Before 2017, structural public deficit will have to diminish every year of 0,75 % of the Gross domestic product (GDP) and, as from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State won't have to show every year 0,35 % GDPS, while the regional States as well as villages will have to introduce budgets in balance.
Objective is to get on the horizon 2020/21 the national debt under the 60 % criterion fixed by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention on the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told on Tuesday that authorities Japanese would intervene once again on the foreign exchange market if the yen had to continue going up.
"We will intervene as we made it last time if we determine an excessive volatility" in the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen went back up not far from the historical levels which pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31st.
That day, Tokyo sold yens in great numbers against dollars to lower the value of the currency Japanese which had just established a new record of vigour since 1945 facing the dollar.
But the yen regularly went back up since, doped by investors' purchases which consider it as a "value shelter" at this uncertain time of worldwide economic slowing down and of crisis of debt in Europe.
The dollar is ironed on Tuesday under 77 yens and the euro went down under the symbolic 105 yen bar, close to levels having launched the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar quoted around 120 yens and the euro more than 160 yens.
This fire of the currency Japanese harms export of the archipelago because it outbids the cost of products Made in Japan and reduces the value of incomes drawn from abroad by the Japanese business companies, when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan struggles for rebuilding" since the seism and the tsunami of March 11th who devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), underlined Mr Noda who fears that this increase of the yen kills fragile resumption in the egg.
The third worldwide economic power retied-1,5 % with growth in the third quarter in comparison with the previous quarter for the first time in one year, thanks to a rebound of export and of consumption of household filled by disaster.
But the Prime minister judged that the dearness of the yen didn't reflect "fundamental economic of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, called from his part the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a meeting of two days of its advice of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the additional governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, told that BOJ had already taken appropriate measures, giving to understand that no additional monetary relaxation was to wait on Wednesday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the institute of programme augmented by 5.000 thousand million yens (47 thousand million euro) its purchases of Treasury bills, getting in 55.000 thousand million yens (519 thousand million euro) the ceiling of sums which she dedicates to the purchases of various financial titles to flood the market of liquid assets.
Euro area:
rates climb, Stock Markets crack up
The risk of contagion of the crisis of debt always mines European indications.
In spite of the designation of new brooms of government in Greece and in Italy and better figures of growth in France and in Germany, the rates of the unstable countries follow their ascent.
Always anxious for the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Markets sink a little more in negative territory, on Tuesday, November 15th.
In Paris, at 10 h, PARIS STOCK EXCHANGE INDEX 40 loses 1,4 % in 3.064 points.
Dax in Frankfurt gives up 0,4 % and London 0,1 %.
" With new tensions on the outputs of the loans of the States of the euro area in trouble, the markets of actions across the world continue returning a part of their recent earnings".
" The investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker to IG MARKETS, city by the agency Reuters.
The Stock Market of Tokyo closed in fall of 0,7 %, suffering in its turn from renewed fears of the dealers of the market about the capacity of Europe to contain the crisis of debt.
" Japan, as rest of the world, stares at Europe and exchanges will continue in a narrow corridor of variations as long as the investors won't have proof that situation is stabilised", estimates Mitsushige Akino, manager of fund at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This rebound of concerns on the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which follows its fall on Tuesday.
The euro evolves in its lowest level for one and a half month.
At about 10 h, the European currency is worth 1,3570 dollar, in 0,4 % fall.
According to the brokers, she postponed after the party of the chancellor Angela Merkel, CDU, united in congress on Monday, adopted a motion notably envisaging possibility for a country in trouble to go out of the euro area without leaving therefore the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates really beyond of 6 %
The rates of loan of Italy and of Spain stay at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the output of Italian obligations in 10 years attained 6,85 %, that of Spanish titles of the same maturity 6,2 %.
These tensions on the rates of interest of the countries of the south, but also in France, continue feeding the fears of the dealers.
The leader of the future Italian government Mario Monti complained of time in markets to restore situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxia by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime minister Lucas Papademos, shone, asserted that the implementation of decisions taken during the summit of the euro area on October 27th would be the "main task" of its government.
Spain is in the line of sight of markets, while legislative elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The distance of rate (" Spread ") between obligations in 10 years of Germany and of Spain attained a new higher review.
Looking forward to the figures of growth of the euro area
Side statistics, France recorded an economic growth of 0,4 % per third quarter, is a bit better that waited 0,3 %, carried by the household consumption.
The French national institute of statistics and economic studies however reviewed in fall the figure of the second quarter, with a detachment of 0,1 % of the Gross domestic product (GDP) instead of an inactivity.
And, it is really the fourth who most worries the economists.
Germany, for his/her part, recorded a 0,5 % growth over the same period.
One waits at 11 h for a first estimate for the whole euro area, while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
facts have to take it on dogmas
If it is a subject which it isn't possible to treat from short-term considerations or out of l "emotion, it is well the energy policy.
Availability and cost of l "electricity influential directly on the purchasing power and on the competitiveness of firms.
It is healthy that an electoral appointment is a chance to think about such stakes and about the place which holds it nuclear technology.
Debate will be fruitful only if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of offered options.
Frenchmen have to found their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 thousand millions d "human beings on the planet, l" demographic evolution will draw away a doubling of request d "electricity by 2050, unless depriving a huge part of the world population of a vital element.
At the same time, it will be necessary to overcome the rarefaction of fossil resources to continue producing of l "electricity permanently, without forgetting imperious required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to struggle against climatic fault, a subject disappeared from ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima changes none of these parametres.
That is why Germany remains insulated in its decision to abandon nuclear technology.
It is the case neither from Belgium, which subjects his to the necessity to be able to find a source of replacement capable of taking the place, nor of Switzerland, who intends not to construct more than power stations of last generation.
In the opposite, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, the Southern Africa, Chine, India, Brazil, to name only they, continue their plans with determination.
The United States, them, decided after Fukushima to add an unit to their park by taking back the building of a power station interrupted after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, centered on renewable energy sources, is sometimes introduced as an example, reality upsets speech.
The choice of Berlin is going to be translated by the increase of price of l "electricity, an energy dependency aggravated by the appeal augmented in the imported gas, especially of Russia, a bound of the programmes of CO2 drawn away by the building of power stations in the gas and in the coal.
In some months, all these unfortunate effects is already felt.
The case of Denmark is to meditate.
European champion of l "wind, whose 30 % of his electricity he draws, he is also one of the biggest users of coal and of gas due to the remission of the wind; by virtue of what, its CO2's programmes and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and higher 50 % than European average.
In the the opposite, thanks to the constancy of our energy policy, our neighbours pay off a bill d "the upper electricity of 40 % to that of French household.
While in a global economy the cost of l "energy constitutes a key factor of competitiveness and a pledge of the maintaining of the industrial tool on the national territory, the French firms benefit of l" the least expensive electricity of Europe.
So, any significant reduction on behalf of nuclear technology would procreate a sharp increase of price of l "electricity, which would return nice statements delusive on the réindustrialisation of our country and defence of the purchasing power.
A price which a large majority of Frenchmen refuse to pay, all the more so as they don't demonstrate fundamental opposition to this energy, opinion polls show it.
Let's remind that the energy policy of our country allowed to build an industrial course of study of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 led jobs.
Strongly exporting, she draws away a galaxy of SMES specialised on the international markets and makes them very creative of jobs délocalisables not.
If France came to decide to go out of nuclear technology, it would be sacrifice a good many of these SMES by reducing as shagreen 6 thousand million annual euro of French export d "equipment and nuclear services.
What electrician would order EPR conceived to work sixty years while the decline of his producer would be programmed?
To solve energy equation l ", it is necessary to suppose that there is source of production d" miracle electricity, no more than it exists of diabolic there.
The development by Areva of CO2's not very broadcasting solutions, nuclear and renewable, manifests the complementarity of sources d "energy.
For nuclear technology, to support the highest level of safety is an imperative absolute.
We have in France an Authority of safety who exercises an uncompromising and transparent control of existent power stations as construction site of Flamanville.
One lives of the same fixed idea of safety in our teams, the professionalism of which is admitted.
In half a century, nuclear industry knew three serious accidents.
The only one, Three Mile Island, intervened in conditions of normal working; he stayed without environmental or human consequence.
In Tchernobyl, the conception of reactor and of unpardonable human errors caused drama.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that accident results from two natural disasters of an unsurpassed largeness which caused the death of dozens thousand persons.
Nuclear industry will draw the educations of this accident, as it had made it for both precedents.
Fruit of this step and of a cooperation between the authorities of safety, the farmers and the French and German constructors, EPR introduces a conception making him capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians eager to construct a power station, the stopping of its building in Flamanville would be a splendid present given to the rivals of Areva and FRENCH ELECTRICITY COMPANY by leaving them the free way to take over leading role in the inevitable development of nuclear technology.
It is necessary and legitimate to search the best energy bunch for our country, but it would be irresponsible to leave l "emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the financial, social and financial status of our country.
Is the immigration a load or a chance for economy?
The politics in immigration led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised under various angles - blocking of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the politics of the figure, compatibility of this politics with status autoproclamé of "country of human rights" from France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment the object of which the foreign students make which was in the news, Interior minister (read Liberalisation of May 23rd) proclaiming in passage that France "doesn't need foreign talents, bricklayers and servers of restaurant".
But she is only seldom analysed under the economic angle.
It is because there is one on this subject enough large consensus enters left and right.
To the right, tone was given by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed persons shouldn't be a problem in a country understanding about 2 million immigrant workers", and to the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't receive all misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fright of the plague of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared to the left as to the right.
For both edges, the immigrants are perceptible as a load for economy and French society.
The only difference is fond of the degree of generosity which they will deign to grant in relation to the immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande stations in banality, pointing out that codevelopment will allow to resolve our "migratory problem".
This idea of immigration as load, a problem, is perhaps paid électoralement; but it is economically very expensive.
As remind of it the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work synthetizing most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our intended, May, 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a large consensus among the specialists on the positive impact of influxes of immigrants on economic growth, wages and job in the countries which receive immigrants.
To restrain immigration weakens growth and harms job.
Fears in relation to the impact of the migrants are founded on the idea which these risk taking the place of the national workers, particularly few skilled, putting a pressure in fall on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much supplementarier than substitutes to the national wage earners, practising for the basics of jobs in sectors in shortage of job.
The not much qualified immigrants work in sectors which don't attract the national wage earners, and most qualified in dynamic sectors in which the training doesn't follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Similarly than a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country which knows anaesthetists' shortage, this complementarity between national and migrants make that immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on wages and job of the national.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that an increase in 1 % of influxes of immigrants draws away an increase included between 0,6 and 0,9 % long-term real wages.
And it without taking into account the fact that diversity brought by the immigrants contributes to creation of ideas and to economic growth (strong proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel prizes; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo was founded by immigrants).
The migrants are also net contributors of the social systems, on average at the level of 1 % complete budget in the European countries.
The worldwide Organisation of job thinks for example that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at age of 30 years will bring a net contribution (recipes less expenses) from 150000 euro to the public budgets on average on of his whole life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of mandate, to go to search the missing growing points "with teeth".
Les bosselle demi-cadratin la question, demi-cadratin le domestique à dissuader les immigrants, ont eu l'exact effet l'inverse.
Europe invented democracy, remains to think of European democracy
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The mainland Europe should be able to remember it him who, to have invented her in Athens more than two thousand years ago, knew during the XXth century tragedies of First World War, totalitarianisms, Holocaust, Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some people could think that it would be enough, so that democracy should triumph definitely over his enemies, to exercise vote, and to exercise it in a most direct way which is.
They know, since Napoleon " the Baby ", that it was about an easiness of thought there.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, isn't sufficient condition and can even make "instrument of oppression" as said in the past the republican philosopher Steven Vacherot.
No, democracy requests much more: a public space, a public mind, stocks, an organisation, a separation and a control of powers, an education, from the Enlightenment, economic and social solidarities, a justice.
The crisis of Europe which we live is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinode of true-wrong Greek referendum will have had in this respect value of revealing double: that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the frontlines of democratic battle have moved today, and that, for many of them, the republican soldiers don't pull any more in good direction.
We have nothing to win to demand a succession of national referendums, organised to the liking of necessities and unsystematic order.
A blank endorsement to the European absolute monarch or a jump with feet linked in the space of the nationalist fall: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want cleavers but an exercise, common, by right, serene and uninterrupted, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There aren't crises in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal - they wouldn't know besides any more where to stop listing l "- because there is no that a crisis, and she is in Europe.
It is very whole Europe which submits to the diktats of markets and of agencies of notation, which suffers as a result of its impotence and its defect of solidarity.
It is very whole Europe which is humiliated on the international stage.
They get worried about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is very whole Europe which loses slowly its sovereignty, and with her each of its nations.
Emergency, it is to give again to popular sovereignty the piloting of European plan.
Because it is together, that the Europeans will be able to take off weight of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from crisis will assume decisions at European level which won't be able to be made without a complete democratic legitimacy, except of course to drive us to disaster.
Having fought for a long time this proposal of the socialists and of Jacques Delors, everybody claims the European economic government today.
Is.
But to think of it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new dead end.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make " republicans.
The Revolution in interests couldn't be enough for it.
This lesson remains valid.
We must construct more integrated Europe in economic terms.
It will be able to be made only by constructing more democratic Europe in political terms, true European popular sovereignty.
To make Europe, let's make Europeans.
Smart cards "without contact" spread
The worldwide living room of the smart card opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
Year 2011 should indeed end on an increase in 11 % worldwide sales of smart cards (bank card, telephone with card SIM), in more than 6 thousand million units, according to the office Eurosmart.
The most bearing segment is that of technology without contact which allows to pay public transport or to regulate its purchases by approaching simply the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold across the world, against 320 million one a year earlier!
Their part should again advance in 2012 (580 million waited units) and to represent about 10 % total markets of the smart card (6,925 million cards).
For a long time in the train of the region Asia-Pacific, Europe gains ground for the payment without contact.
About 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this functionality and 75.000 terminals of payment accept it.
In France, the beginning is more modest: 400.000 cards without contact Visa were displayed.
But supermarkets work very hard.
Crossroad so issued this year 2,5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To speed things up, banks have from now on to equip their clients.
"Two big French establishments promised to diffuse in future systematically to their clients of bank cards equipped for without contact", announces Gérard Nébouy, managing director Visa Europe France.
Banks test the payment by motive
But it is only a first stage towards the means of payment of future: the mobile phone.
Few apparatus are equipped with technology necessary NFC (Near Field Communication) today to perform transactions.
"They fell behind".
"But they should finally know a true development next year".
"We bank on upon sale from 80 to 120 millions of units in 2012 in the world", explains Mark Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But banks take the initiative.
Agricultural Credit announced the launching of a test next from December till June in Caen yesterday.
The iPhone of about 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a plan similar to Strasbourg and Marseilles.
And the general Society, also, told yesterday it prepared the bet on the market of an offer allowing for its clients to pay without contact with their motive.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist forehead stretches
Paris gets worried about links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
Suspected well in advance, links between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even maintained that Algiers there "became convinced from now on".
"The way both organisations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that there is cooperation well", he explained without more precision.
Paris semble faire une analyse similaire.
The inquiry into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have brought footbridges to light.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by fellows of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory must be killed the following day at the same time as some of their abductors during an operation thrown by French special force.
In the debris of intervention, the investigating officers French and of Niger had to find several telephone fleas belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axle
The analysis of passed calls orientates to several interlocutors based in Mali, in Niger and in Nigeria.
According to Radio International France (RFI), two numbers interest particularly the investigating officers: the one leads to an of Niger who stayed for a long time in Maiduguri, a city from the north of Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and other one to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and to the sect.
"It is an advance but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more definite proof before speaking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"They know many years that the sect benefits from external financial and intellectual supports and that she proves to be more and more active", Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher tempers.
These last months these "supports" had been more and more obvious in evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in his surgical modes, which implicate appeal from now on to kamikazes or to more and more complex explosive devices and of the same bill as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, since then lobbied on Abuja so that he takes into account problems put down by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities indeed considered the group for a long time to be a community of illuminating not very worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, around a school and of the iman fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means haoussa there "Western education is a sin" - advocates the institution of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is a quick success.
She becomes politicised and demands a strict respect for the sharia while her activists hire the struggle against the impious central government.
These last aim first at churches, at bars, at administrations.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram prove to be particularly active, to be multiplying attacks against police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as in its habit, without nuances.
The army invests the city, one count 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, living order, is killed in prison.
Since then the sect is going to become more radical and leaves its fiefs of the north.
In last Christmas, she demands an assassination attempt which makes 80 dead to Jos, then other one to Abuja.
In June, it is still in Abuja where Boko Haram is taken in the HQ reassured by the police during an attack its first one commits suicide.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axle in Africa which would sail from Mauritania to Somalia by way of Nigeria worries from now on all specialists of security.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, while the Somalians of al-Chebab operate in on Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat in the middle of the continent.
Last week, during a maintenance in Nigeria with the president Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and claimed to be ready "to share all information".
The world according to the republican candidates for the presidency
On China, on Iran, on assistant to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete of simplism and ignorance.
Can America weakened by crisis manage the complex world with simple ideas, or even simplistic?
To listen to the republican presidential candidates, the voters could believe it.
For some days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others multiply thundering statements and abbreviated in foreign policy, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on assistant to Israel, slogans - often not supported - ring out.
Mitt Romney, best put in running in the nomination of "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chineses in front of OMC and to implicate them "for manipulation of their currency", a bearing topic in America exasperated by the migration of whole sections of the industry towards the Asia.
Oh well if it must implicate the launching of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, ex-ambassador in China of Obama and the only candidate to have a vision of sophisticated foreign policy, nearly strangled himself facing an attitude which "flatters " emotions.
He called to a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of opinion polls, inaudible rest.
Just like Reagan
Romney also promised military striking on Iran if sanctions fail to stop the nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he bragged."
"If Obama is reelected, they will have the bomb."
He also promised to augment the military assistant to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations in relation to this partner.
The businessman Herman Cain, second candidate best put, shows as for him an embarrassing ignorance of files.
Recently, he called to counter military Chinese threat because Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear capacity" - obviously ignorant due to the fact that China keeps the military atom since 1964!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants striking against Iran, claims to be ready, as for him, to hire the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The appeal in torture against the supposed terrorists, forbidden by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are far from the republican candidate of 2008, JOHN MCCAIN, heavyweights in foreign policy.
The adversaries of the current president retort that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won Cold War.
They remind that Obama an amateur was himself and that he had to put some water in his wine in antiterrorism.
They stress justifiably the failure of its naive dialogue with Iran, the departure too much thrown by the "boys" of Iraq, its equivocation in Libya, gluing on it together so a tag of weak-willed person.
But the attack isn't so easy.
The population considers rather positive the balance sheet of national security of Obama, who eliminated Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, she is wary of military interventions which drive to the sinking.
And, by deducing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to revive its leading role, Obama knocks more just.
The North Stream, new door of ntrée some Russian gas in Europe
The North gas pipeline Stream, linking up Western Europe directly in Russia by passing in the bottom of the Baltic Sea, entered service.
He must give some gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate event with great pomp.
More than 500 guests among whom four leaders of State and of government participated, last Tuesday, on the edges of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and fine sideboard, in the unveiling of the North Stream, this new gas pipeline which links up directly, under the sea, Russia in Germany.
Symbolically, the German chancellor Angela Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister François Fillon and her counterpart of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together stealing him from the valve ordering the entrance of the Russian gas in west-European network.
With this new gas pipeline, 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of Russian gas are going to arrive every year in Western Europe by a first 1 224 km tube linking up the region of St. Petersburg at the Land de Mecklembourg-Poméranie.
A second tube must be finished at the end of 2012, allowing to issue in total 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas, that is the equivalent of all French consumption.
And they already recall the possibility of constructing a third on the same course.
For Gazprom, the completion at the right time of this huge construction site has air of victory.
Plan had been strongly questioned by Poland and Baltic countries.
The North Stream is indeed going to allow to deliver some gas directly in Germany, by avoiding any passage of the Earth by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose a little of their power: it becomes more difficult, for them, to influence Russia by threatening to close it the access to the west-European markets.
At the height of debate, Warsaw hadn't hesitated to compare the North Stream with a "new germano-Soviet pact", in reference to alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland, in 1939.
It is to say if subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by bringing its support of this Russian plan, earned it a higher security of its supplies.
But it is at the price of a weakening of Europe energy, since plan created a hole between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia could, in five years barely, make triumph its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western, strongly consumer countries of gas, and deposits of which are in decline.
" This gas pipeline is an element of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which links us in an organic way", confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, showing to what extent the big gas contracts are as political as economic.
All that explains broad grins shown by the leaders of Gazprom, gifts in numbers in Lubmin, so as to arrival of the gas.
The building of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater tube is steel sheathed by concrete to protect it against the anchors of ships.
He is based on the bottom of the sea, in 200 m on average.
To construct it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
" A hundred must be taken away or destroyed, by precaution", points out Jens Müller, spokesperson of the North society Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 turns Eiffel, whom nothing interrupts on all its length: neither valve, or station of service.
A deck of control was envisaged off Sweden, but the representatives for plan abandoned it while the Swedes were not very eager to see a society of Russian State settling permanently off the coasts.
" In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than one minute", specifies Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes therefore in air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the constructors who envisaged soldering to know an escape every 100 000 years.
The surveillance of the state of the gas pipeline is assured by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus which circulates inside the gas pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, he is introduced inside the tube, one metre broad in diameter, and he is pushed by the gas.
At arrival, after three complete days of trip at the speed of 3 metres back up, it delivers definite information on possible distortions of the metal.
The gas pipeline was conceived to work fifty years without credit to suffer the slightest repairing.
The circulation of the gas is simply assured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at first, and 100 at arrival.
Five societies joined their force to accomplish this plan.
The leader remains Gazprom, who keeps 51 % of parts.
E.ON and BASF joined it German (15,5 % each), as well as Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF group Sweat (9 % each).
These five societies created a North common, called firm Stream, made responsible for constructing and for operating on the gas pipeline.
She has her seat in Zoug, in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented to this society, for twenty renewable years, the totality of the capacities of transport of gas.
" Gazprom will pay for the complete capacity, whatever is the quantity of gas indeed transported", specifies Jens Müller.
The financing of the building of the gas pipeline was assured 30 % by the shareholders and 70 % by banking loans.
The total cost of jobs should attain 7,4 thousand million euro for both tubes.
For GDF Sweat the investment, for example, came to 240 millions.
But the minority shareholders are sure of coming back into their expenses, since only Gazprom takes risk.
The gas pipeline appears from the Baltic Sea to Lubmin, on sandy coastal region planted of pines.
Valves, 4,5 metres high, form the exit of the gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas which arrives, before it is transferred in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic metres of Russian gas every hour which passes.
In full capacity, these will be 3 millions an hour and in 2012, 6 millions.
Imitation leather, a leading book.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian firm, Imitation leather wants to give again the taste of the writing.
He has a perfume of adventures, of the hours passed to write in the light of a candle.
The book Imitation leather is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its rubber band not completely white, its leaves of a colour, as aged by time.
However, the book Imitation leather such as he is known today is born in 1997.
The Italian Modo Modo firm, based in Milan, decides to throw a report card design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consulting for the firm, takes responsibility for the launching of the new product.
The book draws inspiration from an ancient technology of production, skin (mole's skin) mole which indicates a cotton varnish used to cover wall seats for example.
This type of book was very appraised of the writers and passengers.
" Imitation leather delayed fashionable an object old and forgotten, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until XX e century", tells Maria Sebregondi, become since the representative for mark to Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales augmented by 26 % to settle in 12,7 million past rooms.
They are far from the confidential production of the first years, when only 3 000 books were conceived.
Imitation leather exceeds Italian borders and is exported in 70 countries, of France up to the United States.
Difficult to establish a photofit of the purchaser, because the report card entices as well the businessman as the student and the professionals.
Just like Imitation leather, his consumers are cosmopolitan, opened of mind and cultivated.
The Italian small enterprise, which counted 12 employees at its beginning, in count almost 100 today and refreshed since 2008 of two offices; the one in Milan and other one in New York.
She distributes her books in bookshops, of Fnac to the small boutiques of city centre and could impose her identity.
" We followed the air of time and this new need of writing, in spite of the development of e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Imitation leather: recently, mark threw an exhibition " Detour " where architects or artists display their own book.
In August, she also threw a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Film festival of Locarno.
Using its success and this cultural aura, Imitation leather could diversify its products: bags, agenda, fountain pens, dust covers of computer... Mark declines on the whole range of support.
A success which made envious: in autumn, 2006, Modo Modo was bought back by the fund of investment Key SG Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Imitation leather.
Why does the unemployment rate of the handicapped workers remain so raised?
About 19 % handicapped persons are in search of a job.
The 15th week for the job of the disabled persons opens today.
In spite of a voluntarist public policy set up in 2005, unemployment rate of the handicapped persons is still twice as high as average: 19 %, against 9 % for the whole population.
Discouraging?
" No, underlines Éric Blanchet, managing director of Adapt, the association which organises the week for the job of the disabled persons."
" Progress fulfilled for fifteen years is considerable."
" At that time the unemployment rate wasn't two but three times as high."
" It remains still tremendously nevertheless to make."
It is necessary to say that for the handicapped unemployed persons, obstacles remain many before achieving job.
They are rather old: 37 % are more than 50 years old (17 % on average).
They have a not very high qualification level: 80 % have no receptacle and on 2,3 million students of higher education, 10 000 only are handicapped.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is very spread: 53 % for the disabled persons, against 38 % on average.
In short, so much criteria which complicate particularly the return to job, and that "constitute the knot of problem", according to Christian Grapin, managing director of Ski jump, an association created in 1992 to help firms to recruit handicapped workers.
Here is for the objective brakes.
The unsaid, the mentalities stays which evolve, certainly, but too slowly.
A study accomplished in April by the association IMS-ENTREPRENDRE for the City pointed out that the questioned managers have "a level of weak knowledge of disability", with a "overrepresentation of the persons in wheelchair, of deficient psychical or intellectual".
Result, the private business of more than 20 wage earners is still far from reaching the target of job of 6 % of handicapped workers, fixed in a law of... On 1987.
The last known figures, which date of 2008, mention a 2,6 % ratio.
" We are now around 3 %", points out Pierre Blanc, managing director of Agefiph, organism made responsible for collecting the contributions of the firms which don't respect this law.
Proof: the number of establishments "taxed ", just as poured sums, diminished between 2007 and 2011, passing 59 000 - 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 millions of euro).
" The law of 2005, which augmented contributions, created a strong pressure on firms, explains Pierre Blanc."
" But this improvement also translates a true realisation, especially in the big groups."
According to the ministry of job, only 59 % of establishments 20 - 49 wage earners use handicapped workers, against 82 % of firms 100 - 199 wage earners.
Hazard: "That of happiness"
Before confronting Overalls on Tuesday evening (20 h 45) Paradise Hazard and Georges Leekens didn't hide the pleasure which gives them this friendly match.
They won't go to the point of writing that there was connivance between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sat abreast on the podium of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Paradise Hazard outright made peace.
Five months after the gesture of mood of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian selector has only praises to be made on his subject.
"I follow be very happy with Paradise, with its progress and due to the fact that he is Belgian".
"I want to go forward", assures for his/her part the of Lille.
As for the contrastre between its benefits in club and in selection, "it is a whole, he cleared himself."
"In Lille, I am there all year long, what isn't case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Handled carefully against Romania on Friday evening with the aim of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to "shine " finally.
Without skipping however the notion of "pleasure".
Overalls, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 years and the victorious countryside of 1998 and 2000.
"I always was to support", he asserts.
Willy-nilly, it participates to reinforce even more the "particular " character of this meeting.
D'autant qu' font face demi-cadratin, "il y Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) et Adil (Rami)", rapelle-t-il.
"They soon crossed."
"To be able to play against them, it is only happiness!"
Good-naturedly, Leekens recalled "pride" from his part.
"Pride" to compete "for a match of gala".
"Pride" also to note - as "neighbour" - that France "became again a team of very high level" a little more than a year after the traumatism of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a job of the thunder", he got enthusiastic.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would well see himself sharing the plane with Overalls direction Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belgians become big", he underlined.
"They are constructing something, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"You are going to realise it during the matches fellows". That counters France included.
Very confident Portugal
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts its dam with a lot optimist return facing Bosnia (22 h 00), on Tuesday in Lisbon.
To go him, both teams had lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country".
Paulo Bento sees himself there already, in Poland and in Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, Selecçao, of which it is in levers since September, 2010, goes to qualify itself for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is really only in 90 minutes happiness.
But there is a match to play Bosnia, and an adversary, to unbolt.
In view of the first leg (0-0), on Friday in the Hell of Zenica, it apparait hollow out that games aren't made.
Portugal dominated the part during more than one hour, certainly, but it was unable to score this such a precious goal, which would have relieved it.
" It is a good result, that includes some risk however because we didn't score goal outside"
But at home, in to them luminous Stadium of Luz in Lisbon, the Portugueses are persuaded to pass, before an audience which should be so scalding there, even if the part promises of course to be " very gripped ", dixit optimistic but clear Bento.
" We expect a very gripped match, but we are completely persuaded to be able to gain the upper hand", declared the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
" We continue being 50 % of chances to be in the Euro 2012", nevertheless put into perspective the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
No brought back on Friday by Bosnia make the Portugueses mark and win.
An any can be enough for Bosniens, too with need to mark.
" It is a good result, that includes some risk however because we didn't score goal outside", regret Bento.
" We are going to play against a team with a lot of technical qualities and that has players with a lot of individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portugueses will have the intention of putting of entrance a maximum of pressure on Bosniens "not to give them the time to think."
A good idea, on the condition of proving to be realistic, this time.
