Parliament did not support an amendment to liberate Tymoshenko
The Ukraine Parliament has today rejected the proposal of repealing the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code which condemns opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the way to the release of the former Minister, but members of Parliament rejected the proposal to reduce sentences for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for the alleged signing of an agreement with Russia disadvantageous for Ukraine on purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not yet firm, the Court of appeal is obliged to review in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that it was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West raised doubts about the impartiality of the tribunal.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code which were sentenced the former first Minister was supported by 147 members in the vote.
226 Votes were needed for approval.
The victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan revolt, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried at a secret location in the wilderness and without it there is no war.
It remains to define who is the winner
As it is already usual in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it's whether it's moderate or radical
The National Transitional Council has made entry into force of the customary law, the Sharia, which already to some extent we know.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves on cut off the hand.
Women may be forgetting emancipated and apostates waiting for his execution and so on.
Rather than by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warlike tribes, is to join by the Koran.
An order that not us can even imagine, and that certainly cannot be established in Libya.
However, our way of life is not neither the only nor objectively the better and probably them should not, on the other hand, the aforementioned Libyans.
The truth is no longer surprising that Islamic combatants accept grateful the help of unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from his point of view, NATO attacks not headed them an American general, but great Allah, whose greatness held after each successful interventions.
When winners are looking for in Libya, West is not among them.
We are caught in a gunfight which serve the Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without that there are guarantees for profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, not we occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the premises in them is not a problem expelling the "Crusaders"
But, without occupation does get oil companies done with Libyan black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible, but it may be that West can finally boast of protecting human rights.
Provided that the followers of the sharia does not cross us.

Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than one third of children aged between 9 and 13 years are overweight, where overweight affects 9% of the school population and obesity to 5%.
Obese children come mostly from families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current research.
Turns to demonstrate the importance of the environment where you grow to a healthy development of the person, as well as models that serve as reference.
In the table, are children feed, for example, sausages with at least twice as often than children from families with normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dined French fries the day prior to the analysis, which is linked to the prevention programme "obesity isn't a coincidence".
In the families of overweight children there is no habit of sports, which applies to the majority of current families, where only 15% of children responded that his parents, at least once per week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey carried out for 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of the last school year and participated in the same almost 900 children of basic education in the whole Czech Republic.
It was already the second edition of the program of "obesity of is no accident", which supports the General health insurance company and the Unilever company.
So far, they have participated in the project more than 12 thousand children from 4th through 8th grade.
Proper diet and some exercise into family are decisive factors that make significantly reduce the number of children overweight and even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed responded that they have five meals a day according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, meal, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", contains one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with sausage for dinner
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, are important, in addition, the details, which have also, as for example have one fixed hour for breakfast in family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 per cent of the families of school respondents at the same time.
In the majority of families, each breakfast only.
But the worst was discovering that in the 10% of households not breakfast nothing.
However, breakfast is the basis of a correct diet.
The study shows that unhealthy French fries are consumed much more frequently in families of obese children.
Almost all - drinking regardless of the weight - daily sweet soft drinks (70%).
As a rule make sport more than 40 per cent of children surveyed, however, enter their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15 per cent.
Fabricar you your diet
The next phase of the study it was possible that the chosen kids (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) is create their own diets from all possible bids according to their tastes and opinions.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of a healthy diet, are far from the ideal."
Their favorite foods include pasta, meat and sweets
"Especially alarming is the popularity of sweet soft drinks", he warns in the final report of the study.
As a main meal pasta takes the cake and is closely followed by poultry meat.
Practically, the children always reject the legume and taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they receive fair information.
"In the control group of participants in the study, they filled the questionnaire after finishing prevention programme"obesity is not a coincidence,"was in many cases a major shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating", is aimed on the results of the study.
It draws attention, for example, as regards the sweet drinks, where many children begin to prefer ordinary water.
Children would also elect most frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist has to be also a good psychologist, claim professionals
In the introductory article, learn how the stylists, already I complained a little that the initial lessons were already pretty loaded.
He had no clue how things would go.
Conferences of three professionals in the industry, how to dress to problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectacle.
And it will be worse.
The closer are the final exams, more information and practical tasks await us
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, already have a PIN.
We are after we have studied with the Director, Alena, (the course there no no man) on how to dress to the woman that does not have a perfect symmetry.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone is cuellicorto, someone has a stylized without appropriate curves figure and someone suffers overweight.
The stylist will know optically smooth wide shoulders, lengthen a neck or recreate the necessary curves
We have been given some tips on how to highlight the body of women from the type of Jennifer Lopez, of enormous hips and breasts but waist close and at the same time not dress her in a way too challenging
If, for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so that the skirt or pants are not adapted, it's worth making sewing at least one piece of extra fabric to measure.
Certainly will not regret, because the clothes that feel perfectly is priceless.
With a skirt to measure will feel much better than one that does not stop moving, get up, danced in the waist, etc.
The stylized body can afford to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, embroidery or draping.
There are certainly many types of miscellaneous and bodies, so I'm glad that I have all week to put order in my head all this information.
Even so, I am afraid that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous, which is to design two dressing rooms: one for day and one for night.
It should take into account the current aspect, the style of fashion that fits the person in question.
Touched me "dress" Miranda Kerr, perhaps her know of the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Cry inside, for me is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, will have lately gained a few hundred kilos (please, take into account the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
The dresses have to cut from magazines or find them online and print them, then develop them graphically.
Moodboard, which is how he refers to the entire result expresses also our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is important to also think about the graphic part of the styling.
The stylist, therefore not wears only physically, but it also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (of specific issues, such as trends, handbags, coats, etc.).
All this we spoke the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this is already for Sunday.
The stylist should have a global vision.
The three invited experts encouraged the Conference on Saturday with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and photographer of fashion Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know you take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows to handle a same garment in different ways.
In this case, the variability is essential.
Thus, such the gabardine (or as they say in English, trench-coat) to Classic you can dress with jeans and t-shirt, but also serves to clothe the naked body with high-heeled shoes and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Either just her sleeves and go up the neck to get a completely different picture.
"Play this", he insisted us.
What I value most is the next tip: "to start working, we need to first know all rules".
"Then already you can break them", said Jakub.
Finally I clear why memorizamos all these formulas, what combines with what, why, if it then turns out that the fashion magazines we find different results.
That is not to mention the parades.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know a stylist must have more clothing types in the reserve which aims to photograph.
Thus, for a history of fashion that has ten pages (thus ten outfits), should be prepared, ready to use, at least fifteen.
And it pictures the clothes works in combination with other items, all of them are different from the ones used in reality.
All this should be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style are themselves, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, which is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but the image and the márquetin have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, for the moment, there is still a clear tendency to use the services of stylists.
Until the celebrities also find him useless (I suffice my skills, my physical appearance is not as important).
And when someone asked to our services, must take into account that it is likely to indicate a very different to his size (smaller) Royal.
Then just guglear and find out if the journals of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained/lost, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted us that the stylist will not suffice to focus in fashion, but you have to understand outfit.
During his work, especially is you should contact the people that dress, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
Known value to people, it is not less, defends his views.
"When a Director hires you so you clasifiquéis him the costume and completéis it with nice clothes, not can pick up and throw all that was and say:" huy what horror "".
"Found at least one couple of things that you can assess and recommend so that someone can get to them", says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fit into the so-called "placovka", i.e. the job board.
This is set around the waist and there are all the necessary tools.
They are objects such as scissors, scissors, quitapelusas, or safety pins. There are also thread nylon (which serves the stylist during the photo shoot of products such as handbags or hats), clamps Special insert of clothing ahead, if this is larger (the pins and other types of hooks are not allowed, because they could damage the tissue), or a set of sewing.
In order not to remain passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to take the bottom of the shoes.
Even during the photo shoots in the Studio, on a flat surface, could damage the sole and much more even abroad.
And we did more than take and take.
We could not touch the shoes with the scissors to avoid damaging them by accident.
So it had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy to praise my work without reservation.
The truth is that those skills fail me very well.
This is only a small part of all those who have heard during all the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've already noticed account devote myself to the styling at the professional level is not a way of rose, but I'm just like what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run competes for America.
Review
A journey in carefree principle is complicated because of a series of oversights improper from a routine trip during the morning shift.
To some extent managed to cover the expectations, but this does not help, if, in fact, not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new awards, to which the title adds The Run, it aroused high expectations already before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new airs old series of races Need for Speed and as a result displayed, appears as a game that should end up failing again a genus of action without further.
We are also curious to know how would be the inserted scenes, where the main character is descended from the car and walk on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much with respect to what we expected.
There are races that may occur by acceptable, but in total computation lose points because of absurd rulings, which come already appearing in the series for years.
Actually no one can not call errors, but it is rather incomprehensible unwillingness of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You entered a story whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sentáis at the wheel on the West Coast in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach the first New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then, in more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place by a different route and stages are located in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
Thus, one does not have remotely the feeling that the game offers always the same.
Some environments are even pleasant view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous installments of the series.
Therefore, it is nothing out of this world.
But the walk through the desert, autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races diversify from time to time by an unusual element.
Thus, for example, in the desert you you are a storm of sand which reduces visibility.
Instead, in the mountains should be careful so that it not sepulte you an avalanche.
According to this, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but this is enough.
For a moment, you intentáis forward to a required amount of rivals (normal in a classic race), then treat gain time (timed classic duel) and it then awaits a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this appears sometimes police, which does not only make things even more difficult.
Novelty are the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations occur when Jack, in the majority of cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button just at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are quite a few less landscapes in the game would be expected (in particular, there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the traces of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer very much, but it cannot be bad.
If you are you looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But for a race designed with enough action is quite this style of driving, although we can find something better between games of the competition.
So far, everything in order.
But problems arise after some time.
Unlike the correctness of the models of conduction, no longer the case same with collisions.
Games of this type cannot be expected that you recreate deformations and complicated collisions, but in fact before a coup against any object, you can not predict how react to your car, so not everything is in order.
It is typical that, to make a tight overtaking or move the car with normal traffic, there is only light friction, but in other nearly identical situations, your car ends up doing pirouettes uncontrolled.
Or even just totally destroyed.
Thanks to a system reset, no big problems arise, but you can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are scheduled in such a way that when you suffer an accident or you log out of the track, the game restores you to the last point of rescue in the track.
However, in each race only are five available resets.
If the consumís all, you have to restart the race from the start.
So therefore it is not more than help in the event that something does not go well, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, or reset help, only aid the learning of the given stage of memory.
One big drawback of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
Some curves, for example, should enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you are somewhere "civilian" vehicles always with the same settings, although you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes but rage impotently in situations, when you see that two cars going to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent anticipates no problems, but when you get, you must rotate either curb.
It is equal when arrive, because it is programmed by the "surprise" will always happen in front of your nose.
Opponents have also one advantage.
During the entire game shall sites where, without taking into account the time, always you brought forward the same opponent on the same site.
This also occurs at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, for a price that is.
When you are in front of you, the vision of the cars that come from the front, so the car can do porridge at the beginning difficult it.
The idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline can be understood, but the execution is so apparent that you surely disappointed immediately.
And it is a pity, because although the journey model is simple, the game is fun and action, so that often it is not possible to continue to detail what happens or where.
And really gives equal, if merit is the idea with 50 exclusive tracks or the classification in the race so that there be no boredom, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to be attentive to the suppliers of gasoline next to the road, because precisely there you have to change car, although in the vast majority of cases you just what you have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports are suitable for urban areas, the strong American cars for the straight highways and the exotic Supercars for technical driving, e.g. curves mountain roads.
In addition main narrative thread also appears a parallel thread of challenges, i.e. There are races in specific locations which you know by the stories.
Here desire not only medals but also experience points to your profile, which serves both to the challenges as the tales.
To achieve the higher level, the driver open you several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is connected an Autolog feature online, compare your results with other players and disponibiliza other community functions.
One of the more difficult to understand elements is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the tunnel of metro (pass), where you put to run in the dark by tracks (pass).
The speedometer you marks between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, from behind the convoy of the metro you arrives and gets you ahead without more.
In drafting surely we will have a discussion about this for several days, on whether during the programming of the game none even a little thought or the authors of truth we take by a bunch of bobos.
The technical side of the game isn't anything special, but at least the General Visual effects are in the most pleasant cases, sometimes even superb.
What so bad that, reduces the quality of image and, occasionally, in a serious way in the most tense moments.
This applies above all to accidents where there are involved many participants, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
So that is the pleasure the greater part of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoid absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have problems in asserting that The Run is the best game of NFS in recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not completed.
Fun is guaranteed, but prepare yourselves because errors you golpearán in the eyes with the strength of a few airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation for negativistas and Eurosceptic.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"Did not expect me to mount a war without quarter".
"Last five, six years, before the situation is stabilised a little, be calm and new players to adjust to their new roles", thus began with conviction their Conference at the Faculty of law the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How does not take seriously its motto "clear and openly on Europe," he said already in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each organ of the EU and its relations with such precision and clarity, it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of law of the u. Carolina.
Vicenová also approved the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"First thing arise criticisms if it is bland, an official grey, able to assume any role, but I have to say that it left all baffled, because it assumed their roles to perfection".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the 27 States members, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU must go".
The new post of representative of the foreign policy and security can be explained from the question: "Who is this EU?" What number can I call her? "." It is therefore an important step towards unification and clarifying of political Union with regard to States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us cheese of Olomouc
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda was, remains and will continue to the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency for two years was a success.
The Czech Republic dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the crisis of gas and organized a Summit for the Eastern partnership.
The fall of the Government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has at the moment many commitments.
In the words of the Ambassador: "a fuss good", not just the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now trying to.
On the other hand, should approve the budget for seven years of the EU, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive greater support and which less? That is something that will be present in the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled their main slogans, with those who came to Europe: "On Europe clear".
"The truth is that I do not like ugly abbreviations, the foreign words or jargon that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels not be invented really cucumbers cucumbers curved or rounded, bananas of various sizes or that nobody is going to prohibit Olomouc cheese?".
It also seeks to capitalize on the environment of the EU and closer to more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
Europe speeds awaits us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of Euro-sceptics and people see more negatives than positives.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of the Czech Republic in the European institutions.
Blame it on many factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write messages of motivation, but also the little support of the Czech Republic.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he emphasized the strength and the collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when come to me a Polish and a Hungarian and gets me a Slovak, a French beside me tells me:" what, already have been those of the Visegrad Group? ", and you see that it does no grace".
In the future, to the EU, according to Vicenová, they await new harsh policy of budgetary policy for the Member States.
Feels like something very real the concept of two speeds, if they are not more in Europe, rather than the new "European Federation".
"We have in the eurozone countries and countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and also the procedure for enhanced cooperation".
"He said for the first time that cooperate only countries who want to and which not, staying outside".
"These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the Europe of two speeds," expected Vicenová.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Czech Republic and Herman van rompuy in the application of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed between the Member States, not only among the members of the eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM starts its second century of existence
If someone looked for a term to define accurately the strategy of IBM, the approximate would be "long term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, already been 100 years since its foundation.
The basis of this far-sighted nature was the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas j. Watson Mr
He already coined the slogan that the world's many problems have solutions if people are willing to think.
Their motto "Think!" became their record label, surrounding by which the life of the future will be building giant (was also the title of an internal review which IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised corporate culture.
"For us, IBM means a long-term thinking, a continuous motion towards the future."
IBM has survived and thrived for years hundred for that reason, because stayed faithful to its basic principles, but without fear to the changes around.
That enabled us, in our first century, transforming the technology, business and society.
"We hope to prosper even more in our second century," he said during its anniversary, the current director of the Samuel j. Palmisano company.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, worried about caring for their employees as the employer of Baťa in Czech Republic (IBM employees were the first American workers enjoyed holidays with pay, insurance, stylish uniforms and a sophisticated system of remuneration that rewarded the best inventors and vendors.)
The same sophistication long-term keeps IBM in the relationship with the client.
From the beginning the company knew discover talents (being one of the first world companies to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could be chosen without any problems).
In line with the strategy anti-discrimination is the current plan of IBM, replaced it a woman next year that Palmisano: Virginia Rometty.
It has been already working thirty years at IBM, where he was head of sales, márquetin and strategies.
In recent years IBM has participated in the so-called virtual meetings, brainstorm online, which gives rise to plenty of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that they pantry ideas, because almost half a million people work in the firm.
An institution with good reputation
The fixed business position provides the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM remained a concept of institution rather than technological company", says the Economist, Harvard Business School Professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for users of the technology," says George Colony of the consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between entering the business and create a business directly.
IBM - or the "great green" - as it is known in the United States.UU. family because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years in one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technological company (develops equipment, programs, infrastructure and services web hosting within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It boasts the largest number of patents of all North American technology companies and five of their employees have received the Nobel Prize.
His inventions include the automatic teller machine, payment cards, the swap, barcodes and floppy disks.
IBM will billed this year $ 220 billion. This year has become the second signature technology by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when exceeded for the first time in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of the customers and the time (IBM not opted for its own operating system, OS/2, services on line Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based in advance, not can anchor itself emotionally in the past", recognized Samuel j. Palmisano.
Why IBM has no problems to build bases in other platforms (and equally, if doesn't work, leaves them).
And that is the difference of the competition, Microsoft, which basically stays and falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM focuses especially on services, of which approximately one fifth are programs and another fifth of teams.
However, even in 1990 teams accounted for over half of the providers fee.
From the year 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets worth a total of $ 15 billion. During in the same period, has spent 58 billion dollars in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have followed since 2008, when for the first time expressed the modern global financial crisis.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first boss, Thomas j. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29 increased investments.
It seems that so far the company IBM has managed to weather the crisis.
The value of the shares of IBM since the beginning of the year 2008 has grown estratosféricamente up to 120%, the net profit of the company has not ceased to increase.
IBM is changing it all, except for its value.
You can expect that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant aguantará.
History of IBM: from cheeses to spaceflight cutting machine
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City for a hundred years, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name was adopted because in 1924 - originally was a brand used in branches of Canada and South America.
The basis that gave rise to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies dating back to the late 1880s.
He owned inventions such as the famous "punch clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint moved to the head of a company of the competition, Thomas j. Watson, that assist it with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed the founder of IBM (the ideas of Watson remain the strong basis on which underlying corporate culture and identity).
Watson led the company until the year 1952.
IBM, as indicated by its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business from cutters meat and cheese to cash registers.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, turnover doubled in $ 9 million and began the great expansion of the company across the continents.
Watson was crucial for the company which, after almost forty years occupying the Chair of the Chief, was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s the staff and IBM computers helped NASA guiding flights into space (mercury, Saturno and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "PCs", which established the standard of computers at the time, came to the market with the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consultancy company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering a full advice and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid these last three years is the concept Smarter Planet, i.e. "a smarter planet".
Its aim is to make more rational technology use, though areas have not yet been planned nor the circumstances, for example, as regards transport and administration of cities has been improved.
For the commercial sector, IBM introduced not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that helps retailers manage the complete commercial cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 opened a branch in Czechoslovakia at the time, the first country that the took in the Central and Eastern Europe.
Today here, the IBM ČR operates also the strategic Center of outsourcing in Brno.
Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe has is in Prague. There is also here a research team of world-renowned works with speech recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, which already do not want to!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said is over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still hope that Josef wake up from his pink dream and would return home.
However already it will not wait, and it has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer as my partner," explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová hosted during the summer to Bartošové in his house, I couldn't even imagine how would end his marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta not had moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
Eventually, Darina resigned, apparently accepted the relationship between her husband and even dismissed him forever.
Rychytář not care you with who lie on his wife.
If a day Rychtář broke through with Bartošová, his wife not expect it at home with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my children, and if you want to live the rest of his life in our House, no one will miss".
"But here no longer live as my dear old donkey who was wrong, but as a man that I join certain ties," said Rychtářová and added that it had already desenganchado her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef so far doesn't care who are women has closed the back door.
"I accept the decision of my wife."
"I'll be with Iveta and there is no possible change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company remains in force, I do home arrangements, I take care of the garden, home, I do the shopping".
"Darina and I we are talking about normally, only thing is that we do not share bed, said Rychtář".
He would if Rychtářová found a new love, does not object.
"We do not sleep together and she does not interest me, nor where it goes or if you have a boyfriend."
"I know that it is my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and assume full responsibility," concludes Josef.
The worst vices of women: also refer to you?
If you ask the men who are able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, you recognize in the following lines, where certain female vices that manage to boil the blood males are cited?
Shopping
Do it reproaches you his Orange media have procurement unit?
Do you have to buy at least a washcloth in week?
Do you like buying often the sales?
Then in your case is that shopping has become a habit.
Some women are given account that should appease his passion for shopping, at least a little.
But let's see, what woman could resist the temptation to walk without more by the clothing stores, find well fitting clothes and then prove it them all in the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
Although for the majority of women shopping is a national pastime, for men it can become almost a hell.
Just remember how many times already has told his partner that it the best wait in front of the door.
The constant dissatisfaction
"Not am I too fat?"
"You need to lose weight at least five kilos - should start to exercise?"
"Do really you I liked?"
Do not sound you these phrases?
A Yes?
Then it is one of those women obsessed by their appearance.
It is not that you should leave care, but many men are allergic to listen to your partner complaining all the time in their physical appearance.
Strong sex is also agreed that the more increases the frequency of complaints, most annoying become women.
Clean and tidy in the first place
It's like an infinite carousel.
Clean the Windows, vacuuming, mopping floors, dusting, scrubbing the bathtub and all that at least two times per week.
Do he reproaches you her partner clean soil with a dirty foot, their children that have marred a newly cleaned sink and a bookcase with glass doors that hard cleaning has stepped on?
In the event that you suffer this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and the cleaning surely not should be be primordial in the family.
This harmless desire of cleaning could threaten its relations and family welfare.
Make unpleasant comments
"The used underwear are left with dirty clothes."
"You want to get also tomorrow those used socks"
"The wet rag not left on the floor!"
If those comments to your partner more times a day, know that you will thus get out of their boxes.
Naturally. You don't want to say anything bad, only wants to ensure that everything is in order.
Perhaps, if men knew this, women, for its part, would not be so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women are also going the slander, gossip, but also offenses and conspiracy against someone.
Women are concentrated in the relationship, why they like talk about things together the type who, where, who, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes can escape a small and harmless gossip.
With hand on heart, that is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are avaricious women of those who do not control, those that love chismorrear do often, despise all and are dangerous to those who surround them, especially in a women's employment team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with his assists to defeat the Philadelphia
Jaromír Jágr hockey striker on Monday entered the NHL encounter with two assists that brought victory over the Philadelphia 5: 3 in the field of Carolina and again put the Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the play of the star of 39 years, and took one step further and was declared best player of the match.
Two assists in the party and also the companion of Jágr, Jakub Voráček was awarded.
After the meeting, Jágr told journalists of overseas Giroux had predicted a great night.
"Already before the match he told him that it would treble".
"What he foresaw".
"Sometimes seem to ambushes," explained Jágr, once his performance gave him a goal to Giroux, following the first trallazo of the Flyers.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech track.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the goal of the Hurricanes and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who got goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but since the beginning of the second part already dominated the Flyers.
Specifically by Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr got the third goal when his shot colase by the fourth goal from Wayne Simmonds.
"I love to play with him".
"I don't mean to be the best player on the pitch, but certainly is among the top three," he approved Jágr to their parent.
"Never would have occurred to me that at the end of my career I would play with an athlete like him".
"I'm very satisfied of this."
"I want to play for him."
"All these years in the NHL, my colleagues were playing for me, and that now produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still became the party a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again from Dwyer, of penalty, to reach a goal from distance.
Matt Read not allowed more complications, although they eventually outnumbered in number two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
"It cleared the disk, I took speed and Read was the farthest side."
"I tried to hit him to the disk and I am happy because I got," he described Voráček the last goal of the match as he lived.
With his victory, Philadelphia has been at the top of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of the Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third retired due to an injury in the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with much experience in defense, but also by a difference of two goals, 2: 3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to take advantage of one of the shootings.
More than the lost points local coach he deplored the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game with only five defenses.
"That's bad."
"We play the game alone with a veteran player, the rest were newcomers.
"Anyway, but is against that nothing can be done, we have to deal with this", said Jacques Martin.
"Both rotate players turned against us, we could not resist".
"We had to simplify more still the game, remove the disc of our field."
"And thus leave gaps," explained one of the defenses, p. k. Subban.
Ondřej Pavelec goalkeeper contributed thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the 5: 2 on Tampa Bay victory.
Goals from Jets were marked by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five matches.
How have travel prices evolved since 1989
Until 1989 in then Czechoslovakia had only five State travel agents authorised: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The time travel agencies sold travel only to the Socialist bloc, in the majority of cases because travel to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists would, therefore, on vacation to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union, (Crimea on the Black Sea Sochi) Bulgaria and Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when he could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime moved westward and the Czech tourists trips were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact to the citizens of the Socialist bloc (i.e. also to the Checoeslovacos) not be enabling them travel free and individually even in the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, needed a letter of invitation, if not, the individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those days also travel West, but one should be at the tail with a sack of sleep and thus spend all night, or have "good friends" in the Agency.
Yet all was not won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "people politically unreliable", so could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a currency freely convertible and without guarantee of change, it was not possible to obtain (the Western currency) resources to travel to the West.
The vast majority of the Czechs spent your holidays in their own country, so it had a large number of cottages and summer homes, the Czechs were acquiring. This custom still persists.
How to travel from the Czech Republic has suffered since 1989 a revolution.
While until 1989 for us was not more will spend the holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs took 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is nna great paradox that today day are no longer aware, the fact that to the destination currently favorite, Croatia, until 1989 not you could travel freely, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
Early 1990s won exemption from visa to travel to the neighbouring States of Western Europe, which caused a huge wave of visits of short duration, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The checoeslovacos, for a long time, were not had enough of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at the least for a moment.
For example, in Paris sleeping groups of Czechs in the parks in tents, that our income then do not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs at the time was the take with you the food (canned foods, sausages, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech Crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, buy freely Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it also the average wages, around 1997 causing an increase in demand for travel.
With the increase in demand for travel began agencies, from 1997 on a regular basis, prepare travel using Charter flights connections, what did incredibly lower travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the volume of passengers.
At the end of the 90s of the last century, already the Czechs traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries, except United States.UU., which further simplified our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism already happened in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech Republic to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Depart every year from that year, direct Charter flights with Czech tourists was hot and distant countries. This winter is already directly flies from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries currently visiting about 100 thousand Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this era, that symbolizes our development post-revolution, arrived in 2008.
November 17, 2008, EE.UU. It eliminated visas for Czech visitors, with what our country came to be among the more developed countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs for the first time in its history, have spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history, have been spent in travel abroad more than 15 thousand Czech Crowns per head, including expenditure on the site of stay.
Convened General ordinary Assembly to elect the President, who could end up again at a dead.
For almost five months the Czech football is without President and likely successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Federation of football (FAČR), will not become known or following the call of the next extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Poděbrady.
Indeed, it has yet to agree on voting rules to follow.
Without them, you shall not vote even to choose between the three candidates.
Stakeholders to preside over the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June but not before convening his colleagues with the aim of finding a strong person that knew to deal with football in the future.
However, after the conclusion of the era Hašek, unleashed a controversy between the two federations of the Association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This became clear on September 16 when he had to be elected the new President.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dům), located in Prague's Smichov district, because the talks had blocked and not only with regard to the method of choice.
It was not reached any consensus or who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegates with full powers.
From that time and because of this single point, was a partial agreement, also backed the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remains open.
More light on the situation could shed or the Executive Committee which, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary, basically resolved nothing.
The opinion about the possibility of vote has changed a couple of times already, but the point remains the same.
The question is: for how to proceed in the third round to avoid the deadlock?
"The dispute revolves around whether is should proceed according to the statutes or find another model", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAČR, from the direction of the Association, which represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win that candidate who has highest percentage of support in the Federation which shall submit his candidacy.
The region of Moravia is ready to reach a compromise that can win the candidate with a greater total share of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian part, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have at least two-thirds majority.
"This take away you, however, the sense of two previous rounds and would deny altogether the concept of bicameral system", that is how Svoboda understood the objections of the Moravian part, according to which it would be best not to touch the agenda and vote according to the applicable statutes.
With that said, surprisingly, it is agreement also Tomaš Paclík, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all candidates more suits Pelta.
"I would like to that you vote to the maximum according to the statutes".
"To not be invent any nonsense about the representatives as in the last General Assembly", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, postulated for the first time as a candidate and which mainly addressed its observations against Pelta.
Peltarion remains upbeat.
According to him, in Poděbrady this will decide on the new President, and he believes that candidates in the future cooperate constructively.
"All the passions apaciguarán with the party today of our national team in the European Championship."
"Football will be protagonist and thus cooperate more to taste" says the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates have more experience in management of football, both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reluctant.
"I hope that an agreement is reached, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It is not the conflict between Bohemian and Moravian, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may have as a result a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"Anyway, I hope that common sense will be imposed," said Rajchl.
Already do not have much time to ensure that all parties reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can say until the start of the party if the football team will complete?
The special plane, which had to travel to Podgorica, among others the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to find an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee to the place where qualifying match will take place.
Maybe the decisive meeting, could finally be which will take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of education, youth and sports, would like to much mainstream parties divided the more powerful the country's sports organization to ensure that it reaches an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the next Assembly General of the central Committee of the Czechoslovak Federation of sport (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to the Czech sport following the financial problems of the House of lotteries Sazka.
Paclík will fight to reach the Presidency, because can't find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Pilsen, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate who prioritized all his ideas on the new President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), or presented as a candidate for a post as relevant.
"If there is a right person, I would be fighting for it and I would not present as a candidate for the elections."
"But until today no could be found a person as well," said Paclík to the Agency of Czech news (ČTK)
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is precisely the possibility of blocking Pelta, the winning course of the elections, which opens the way to the Presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, in case they win, he would remain in Office as President only until 2013, when come the turn of the ordinary general Assembly.
In that position you would like to see an expert and good Manager is not unrelated to football events.
"I have spoken with some people that could take into account".
"For me was crazy to hear some say at this time even they want to identify with the Czech football."
"I would like to change that view," he adds.
What supposedly more annoying to Paclík at this time is the relation of Pelta with the President of the Association of Regional football of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a past controversial, known outside the scene as a powerful lobbyist with capacity of influencing the vote of the delegates in the general Assembly.
For Paclík it is as unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"Should he win, it would maintain the existing status and nothing in football will change."
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious business man, the football will draw even less advantage", said Paclík.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone tapping during the investigation of a case of corruption, of which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring the victory of Pelta."
"And with what eyes we will look at UEFA and FIFA," said Paclík, who also takes his earlier statement that "sell the Pilsen Club if Pelta to become President" with some caution.
In the case of winning the election on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Same opinion is another candidate, Rajchl, which has been supported by Paclík before the General Assembly in September that ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first that would follow."
"It is very capable."
"I so could imagine, for example, as head of the representation".
"but not as a manager of an association".
"I put nor the nose where I am not able to," added Paclík, which in September raised much attention by support the suspension of the referees Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it would manage the Association.
Private enterprise management capabilities, used since last summer, it is also the Director of Pilsen, with its support may the triumph in first division.
"I have strength to change some things in the field of football and to contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of certain pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary Committee and appeal, producing unpleasant situations, said Paclík without hiding their antipathies towards the President of the Sparta Daniel Křetínský."
One of the priorities would also be the consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which put pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems that the new President should be given."
"If they were to increase taxes on gambling, as announced it the political parties, he would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where is all this money," said.
In addition, Paclík now does not consider even its association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Peltarion is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"But see no sense to the fact hypocritically assign my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person then there again after a year and a half," said Paclík.
Peltarion promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the stalemate of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of the candidates for the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, if elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had a new Constitution that could definitively to resolve disputes regarding the electoral regulations in the future,.
The representative of the Jablonec is optimistic about meeting this Thursday in Poděbrady, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Even before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of being elected, precisely in representation and in fund-raising.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the last general Assembly, so this delay of two months could go you either to defend and present their ideas on the management of football in a broader context.
"The people at all levels focuses on football already for a long time and expects to know this Thursday to the new President."
"Feel that it is time that someone manage the Association", thinks the man that is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, believed to have enough experience to manage the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the general Assembly of June were approved the statutes were not so perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, have a President already since September," warned Pelta.
Exactly the rehabilitation of the most important document of the civic association was used as a decoy to win delegates.
"If you elect me President, so I shall take as a personal challenge and am prepared to respond in the event that this fails."
"It is a matter of principle, without which we can not exist," says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to mess with his opponents.
Already in the past had been warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, which respected for his training in law, being aware that his opponent would be also his first Vice President.
Had already long been without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave puppet head.
"It takes more than one year in the world of football, and it has already achieved some successes."
"Their attacks but they were shameful and many people was surprised by the electoral campaign."
"So many of them doubt about his true character," he told his opponent Pelta, which remains faithful to the declarations already announced in September.
Its most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from lower competitions until the higher.
The latter should be promotion of the football showcase.
"Also it would solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption of the past year scandal."
"Immediately after I involve in negotiations with the public and the private sector, to ensure that enough money for all of football there is", said two months to the ČTK the candidate of 46 years.
He then also promised that his appointment as President of the football would not result in personal modification of the template.
"Should first know the tasks of each employee," said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy reigns an understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that predict before the next general Assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain Thursday to Poděbrady.
"If the only point of disagreement will be how to vote in the third round, no doubt we will achieve overcome."
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if you finally have a leader", still two days before the most crucial day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working forward.
If the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as new President of the Association of Czech football, many people would be certainly embittered.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, will work hard.
You want to implement a systematic change and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of football individually.
It also undertakes to solve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work initiated by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I would like to devote myself completely to football".
"Since the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, through professional football or training of young footballers from high performance."
"This not to say that you would all only", Rajchl said in an interview for the ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the powers of the Executive Committee in such way that each Member can devote to an area specified."
"And I asignaré difficult tasks so that football can, in each of these segments, push ahead with great momentum.
"A lot of people this probably not you like, because it will mean start work very hard and not only criticize the work of others", he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, said that he had considered not to stand again as candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will be meaningless and that there will be people behind my me prevent and hinder at every turn", explained the reasons for his indecision.
"Many people told me that I must give me up, because then they would give up also others".
"It's having faith to not abandon, without more," he said.
As they say, it motivates also continue the work which began with Hašek.
"During these two years, was completed much of the work that I do not it is now lost."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have its effect within a couple of years and not I like that someone stop them", concerned by the fact that, if they chose another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the Association could again be as it was before the time of Hašek announced.
"I believe in the order, and it is something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep."
"Behind him is especially all those people dealing with football to make only a privilege for a few chosen."
"Was I can blame a lot of things, but not the fact that I am in favour of someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make a football for all, because only in this way will feel well all and not only those who were elected," said Rajchl.
It also rejects the idea that the President would only be Bohemian.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I have in mind do as much by Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact of dividing the second division in a Czech part and another Moravian, whose winners would go to the first division".
"No would be the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young Moravian players", said Rajchl.
Although the struggle of the presidential election joined Tomaš Paclík, President of Club Pilsner, Rajchl no longer believe in their chances of being elected.
"Still feel have strong support from the Czech Federation, which I chose as his Vice-President and he knows that behind me there is clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include the saving of a few tens of millions of crowns of disadvantageous contracts, negotiations of television contracts and negotiations on the law of the lottery.
On the other hand, it recognizes its share of guilt in which the Federation is not United.
And while it proclaims that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in the Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate that does have something to offer to the football.
"Nobody can deny that you did a great job by the Pilsen that year."
"Should he be elected, probably will continue to what already started Ivan Hašek and Exchange not in a meaningful way the staffing in the committees."
"I do not want to use that to my advantage", thus evaluates Rajchl rivals.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible perspective, lavish baths in Budapest: who visits Europe can live his wonderful blue, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best welfare in the water.
When Iris Meder made a journey of research during the year and half past, there was something that could not miss in his luggage, a bathing suit.
Lying on his back on the water, I looked at the art dome atop, swam towards the whole of marble, her waiting in line at the edge of the pool and wondered before the modernist indoor meticulously restored.
Liked the bathroom, he noted in his book to the time of all the interesting about the style details and history of the building.
The architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in his recent book "Badefreuden": the indoor swimming pools in Munich, the historic palaces of the bathroom in the Black Forest, the "concrete buildings" in Taunus.
He made his "trip by the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" by 13 countries: addition of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46 years old German is a true enthusiast of the bathroom culture.
Don't want to have anything to do with the sport, says Meder, only the water is different.
It only bothered that the bathroom fans have to comply with blue tiles and stench to chlorine, while fans to run can breathe the fascinating smell of spruce forests or hear the joyful trills of birds in the Park.
"One day I wondered why swimming pools have to be always so ugly", affirms this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of water doubles the architecture.
Splash in the swimming pool and the ethereal oils of the sauna. The factor of well-being in the pools is so great because addresses all the senses, according to Meder.
And if the Builder strives, the pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of soil, the bathrooms have a surface of water."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the building."
All bends optically: the high vaults, color tiles, the trampolines.
The book with pictures on small format "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data about the architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, collector of pools discovers copies highlighted in his research on Hungary.
Next to the magnificent medicinal baths as the bath of Budapest Széchenyi, 100 years, are the waters with nitrates in a unique Karst cavity (cavities in Miskolc-Tapolca bathrooms), as well as some hot springs, whose swimming pools are alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: while citywide puts eyes in the indoor pool of Zurich, you can look at Arlberb, covered in snow, from the outdoor swimming pool for a dip in St. Anton, y: in the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski slopes.
The design, perhaps more extraordinary waits for customers in hotel: the Cathedral of Ötztal water seems a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
Three open source upload steam in winter, while background Ötztal mountains rising in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
At Meder, collector of swimming pools, not was it invading the smell of chlorine in all pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur in the baths of Békescsaba, Hungary Árpád, the plague to diesel is so strong that people believed to have come to a sanitary bathroom.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters containing bicarbonate and alkali and whose silt sticking to the skin into the pool, an enjoyment of well-being in a special way.
IRIS Meder also was disappointed in a place in their quest for nice bathing places, when he wanted to visit discovered pools and baths of Sun in the Czech Luhatschowitz bathroom, he found a locked field.
The bath architect Duan Jurkovic 1902 was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling Windows of the modernist building red, white and yellow, he saw the weeds growing between the tiles.
Decay counters in a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction after it; not only you can find elements neorománicos of time of its construction in 1844, if not also an Arab style Alhambra hall, added in 1900.
From his careful modernization in 1995, the thermal Palace is bath favorite collector of swimming pools, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the black forest.
"It has much merit merging different architectural styles in a unit so fantastic", says Meder.
In a Palace and immersion in the thermal swimming-pool apparently is not very important.
Land speculation
Deutsche Bank examines the business of raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Resignation Deutsche Bank to your business with agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to verify the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the Consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not seem acceptable that banks cannot gamble with raw materials agriculture like wheat or maize.
Two-thirds of respondents claim that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions should be withdrawn from this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer Foodwatch organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on the global commodity exchanges make up prices and banks bear the responsibility of the world hunger problem.
The campaign of the Consumer Ombudsman addresses in particular Josef Ackermann, head of Deutsche Bank, although the big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley Act similarly.
Originally, bets on raw materials is thought to protect traders from fluctuations in prices.
Leading experts are in agreement that players have decoupled the offers and demands, and take profit of the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticisms of U.S. competitors differently: he promised to review the claims and said that no business "worth compromising the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the report of Foodwatch claims.
The analysis should be completed at the end of the year, then will present the results to the directors of the Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation of how handle the matter.
At the end of January, the direction of the Bank shall inform the consequences.
At the end could be a reduction of the business of raw materials, or even their total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix her image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, held the news, but it reaffirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "bets at rising food prices show especially drastically how ruthless banks are currently damaging the public welfare."
Ackermann is as the largest banking lobbyist, especially in the obligations.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all their portfolio investments which put at stake the money for bets in food prices," said Bode.
"No matter if Ackermann is the subject of the people passing hunger or the fame of the Deutsche Bank."
Inspection of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the head of the Consortium wants to offer a perfect image few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will change something different to you had not planned on the Board of Directors.
With the abandonment of the controversial land speculation can improve its image.
And you need that just they imported possible losses, that will deal with his successor.
Two-thirds adoption would deny them the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Barely 10 per cent felt legitimate that Deutsche Bank offered investments in which play the food prices.
Many clients of the Bank showed personal consequences to discover that his bank was involved in such business: according to the survey, two-thirds adoption would deny them all investments that get money from land speculation.
43 Percent desaconsejaría a Bank so to acquaintances, 49 per cent would request, after reflection, cancel your account and changed to another Institute.
The 21 House in Vienna
The transferred Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the flag of the Austrian universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was in Vienna for a Museum, stayed empty and collapsed.
Now it opens as exhibition house.
The architecture of modern postgerra are passionate about, clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of the thinking on technical progress, for what, the Austrian Pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix for architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The construction is considered today a contemporary landmark of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built the Austria flag in the following Exposition.
With its legendary Tower of four cylinders for more MBW adjacent building flattened in Munich, became internationally known.
Its flag, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions was lifted after the universal exhibition in Schweizer Garten Station South of Vienna, was amended in 1962 and opened inside a Museum of the 20th century, was called the "House 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a Museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until that contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and falls more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the Pavilion, now called "casa 21" and will be used in the future as Museum of contemporary art.
The Tuesday evening opened the Museum belvedere, to which belongs the House, with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new Director of the Austrian Gallery belvedere since 2007, achieved a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, skater on ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and Director-founder of the Museum of modern art, Salzburg, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funding and private sponsors and established its use.
Except for the contemporary art, are the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba in the eponymous Foundation, should have a cafeteria and a library and also to build an office building.
Low budget, strict control
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he reformed to a significant extent the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, it expanded and was awarded the contest, if not because he studied under Schwanzwer in the Technical University of Vienna and the Pavilion was for him a "place important and huge", which provided "almost all weekends" exposures.
I knew the project and the problem of the building, who disappeared with his transfer to Vienna with its change of use with generosity and ease.
There are major problems in current reforms, the building was "a Devourer of energy", said Krischanitz.
Changed the profile of the façade of glass Windows, was installed an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass and replaced the glass by a special safety glass ceiling.
The thermal bridges and steel beams were strengthened or replaced and the roofs of asbestos were rehabilitated.
Two cellars were used for the new use, a light panel dropped between the House and the street provides the illumination, serves as a bridge to join the almost new building, but still the flag of Schwanzer.
Remain the original exterior doors, the House is painted in shades of old mahogany and protected against oxidation.
And cinema is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a strict control of the Office of monuments and a low budget.
"Often had to find material that it was good, cheaper and also liked the Office for protection of monuments", says Krischanitz and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The Pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, said recently Krischanitz, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
An architecture is always "in the wrong place" and therefore wanted to "wake up the appropriate awareness".
In this case the House 21 is not in the wrong place, has been a stroke of luck urban. Totally new and planned "from the central station", with homes and offices, is located next to Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps happens another stroke of luck: the House 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the temporary Berlin art room and as he hears, negotiated with the city on a neighbouring place in Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans to a package of crisis of winter million
The company has devised a plan of crisis, avoiding breakdowns of trains in winter.
You must double the number of staff.
What it costs millions.
In the fight against the failures and delays of trains caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent this year more than 70 million euros, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, the investments planned until 2005 a total of around 300 million euros.
For what should achieve better availability of vehicles and the railway network still an extreme weather.
Among other things, planning to bend employees internal and external to 16,000 posts to remove the snow of the tracks and platforms.
The objective is to clear the walkways of snow and ice for the functioning and 90 per cent of the necessary switches to operate in a period of four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, Chairman of Deutsche Bahn warned of breakdowns and delays on the trains this winter after a Summit with the Government and the industry.
Deutsche Bahn last winter suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, that, among other things, lacked reserves to adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been years waiting for authorization from the federal railway Office.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn is working since years in check the axes of the high-speed trains often in the workshop, once a high-speed train suffered rupture of an axis in the Cologne central station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions of dollars fines in the United States.UU.
After the tumult on President Josef Ackerman, appears a new problem in the United States.UU., Deutsche Bank must pay there a million dollar fine.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the United States.UU. get to the giant of the industry, the Frankfurt Institute pay 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in an agreement, to put an end to strife due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative of credit during the financial crisis.
It's the sale of mortgage securities.
The NCUA financial markets regulator complains many large banks to mislead by false promises credit cooperatives to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such titles lost their value during the financial crisis and drag the banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the issue without requiring the parties to go to court," said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank does not accept any fault with the agreement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $ 20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, Chairman of the NCUA, held the courtesy of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions.UU. and provides support in bankruptcy to protect the investments of clients.
The NCUA seeks to reintegrate million losses arising.
Currently closed agreements are the first type.
The regulator had also requested accounts to other large banks and established summer lawsuits against Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, they are the so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the real estate bubble in the United States.UU. it erupted in 2007, led to the downfall to many financial institutions.
In September, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, Lehman Brothers U.S. Investment Bank collapsed.
Although the results followed some years ago, currently blows a wind complicated for us banks.
Inspection and investors have filed countless processes to receive compensation or punish misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA in its acronym in English) has produced the largest number of demands.
It accused the 18 major international banks that the two mortgage agencies State Americans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have profited from the business of mortgages in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank is also a demand for the FHFA he is business amounting to 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute responds "substantial losses", without naming a figure exact.
Deutsche Bank rejected as unfounded debts and explained that he wants to defend himself.
Warren Buffett contributes 10 billion to IBM
The guru of finance, Buffett, invests vigorously in the IBM information technology company.
Since March it has acquired shares for a value of more than $ 10 billion.
So far the great American Investor Warren Buffett always said not to invest in companies in computers or information technology that forecasts of long-term business development are negative.
But he has read the trade report by IBM and changed its opinion about investing in the sector.
He should understand a lot before that IBM offers mainly services and seeks to computer systems for other companies information technology departments.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive information technologies call "Sir IBM".
Buffett unveiled today on CNBC economy station which has acquired IBM shares for a value of 10.7 billions of dollars since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has promoted this to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that IBM failed until now none of the commitment.
He praised the direction that dealt with the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"Have done a great job," Buffett said on the strategy.
IBM established for some time-for-profit information technology services such as the operation of centres of calculation.
More than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for companies.
Buffett avoided technology companies to date.
He said that he only invested in companies whose business understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took the opportunity in a goods train, a manufacturer of lubricants or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns close to 80 subsidiaries own, as well as part of a series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener re.
Buffett, 81 years old, took charge of the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
However, your lifestyle is humble.
It is an Idol for many investors around the world.
Its fast and infallible sense for money has provided the "Oracle of Omaha" nickname.
After discovering the investment from Buffett, in IBM shares in stock exchange rose one percent.
"The big blue", as he is known to IBM, has a value in stock market of more than $ 220 billion and, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, said Buffett, it does work.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "the cell of Zwickau", the Turkish media doubt the State of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" which again rekindled.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs tricks and Greeks between the years 2001 and 2006 have a background of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returns a ghost believed to be dead long ago, since the attacks shaped fires in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, more episodes of violence with background of the extreme right against Turks had not occurred.
However, it has never questioned that xenophobia exists in Germany.
The right-wing network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, nor much less predictable.
"It comes back to revive the bloody ideology?", called the Edition by the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk" internet.
The newspaper "Sabah" highlights on the contrary that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for defense of the Constitution and is worried that the German authorities may be involved in right-wing pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, the weekend he recalled the victims of racist violence with a vigil before the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with the German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the turco-alemán agreement.
Coexistence was on scene with bright colors, such as a story with a happy ending.
The information reached some Turkish media as a slap in the face: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Having X", referring to the background of the chain murders.
The German emission "Hürriyet" nor insists on drawing this mental connection.
"Starts to smell", says the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It highlights that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with his work for the reconstruction of Germany.
Germans of Turkish origin internet forums, the behaviour of the police and his later success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors astonish of that German authorities not have sought much earlier suspects in the circle of the ultra-right.
One shows the less rhetorical on dramatic media: "now here is lost, the immigrants do not have more than self-defense and weapons".
"This will be the better self-protection".
"The inner peace of Germany strongly depends on the quality of clarification and the appropriateness of the penalty to the whole network"., writes "Selen".
This means that, if the inner peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen brightening in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has recorded in German and Turkish reports.
No other event more clearly showed the Turks who live here that there is a specific threat and the Germans than mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
Attacks deepen the sense of Group of the Turkish side.
Not to repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was criticized then mainly the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the form of Solingen fire bombing sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced him at the funeral of Cologne. Kinkel explained in his speech that contribute with taxes the Turks from Germany.
How to calculate the value of a person according to the amount of their tax is clear.
Current information from the Turkish media once again show how deep it is, since then, the mistrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort of explanation and a reassessment of the extreme right in Germany terrorism, this time needed Frank words.
The Bank of the Lake of Zurich scandal
The more risky Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slipped a crisis to the next.
Now headed by a German.
Sure that Axel Weber had not thought.
After his dramatic departure from the Summit of the federal Bank, July met that in a new and almost equally spectacular work would begin in 2013: President of the Administrative Council of the Swiss Bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber rejoices publicly, commended Switzerland for its beauty and UBS on its newly acquired strength and drops kind comments on his future teammates.
"The USB has a revitalization".
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it became clear that everything would be totally different.
A financial operator of the USB in London avoided all the security systems of the Bank and defrauded 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Administrative Council of the USB was considered since then also played, and everyone asked: When does arrive Axel Weber?
Met that Weber must advise the Bank from February 2012.
And it will take over the Presidency of the Board of Directors in may, not at the beginning of 2013, as the Bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not banker, rather, Professor of Economics and Advisor and has been a period of adjustment certainly necessary.
Coup is responsible for the strategy of a Bank, just to prove he deserves the title "the biggest bank scandal in Europe" long.
On the one hand, the USB is enormous, until recently was the largest global property administrator, and on the other hand, for years, slides in a scandal to the next.
Nothing, so seems it, will save the once so proud Swiss Bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of Swiss goods administrator discreet and solid, but also tricky, combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.
On the one hand, with $ 1.6 trillion, the USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other Bank in the world.
And on the other hand, advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's big banks.
This impresses.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later Professor of banking in Zurich for many years explains: "To my students always have qualified to the USB as a model of a good Bank."
"From the current point of view, one wonders: how could mistaken?"
It was a big mistake.
In 2007, it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
Mid-year, Peter Wuffli, director-general, which until then was regarded as a brilliant and highly intelligent, banker surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, suspected the reason.
The Bank Investment Fund embarked on with high-risk securities losses and had to repay billions.
To load this, USB announced an injection of capital of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this found investors, of course that some look with contempt until shortly before: an Asian and opaque State Fund of Singapore and a State Fund Arab, so discreet, who had never heard his name.
This was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Administrative Council, in 2006 in the second best paid Administrative Council of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, he continued the catastrophe, in view of their misguided investments, UBS was found in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought distressed securities from UBS by many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billions of francs by a mandatory convertible bond, through which he became co-owner of the Bank.
All Switzerland was affected, stated dramatic it was this for a small country, if houses as large banks.
Finally the sum of the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times greater than the economic results of Switzerland (see graphic).
"Can not return to bail out UBS," said Geiger, expert in banking.
The first disaster was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, that were possibly disappointed taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, approved a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified benefits of these businesses with a severance payment.
Thereby, the UBS confessed more or less have aided in tax evasion.
Simultaneously lost something that had always been its capital in competition by rich clients: the aura of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
This followed the resignation of the President of the Board of Directors and the President of the Administrative Council.
And the exodus of funds from the clients.
In this way, in a few months the Bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: banking investment through erroneous speculation and asset management through support for tax fraud.
And just when I was back at something more quiet, just when you thought UBS returned to achieve this, does this unfortunate story of the operator, an individual operator disappoint 1.7 billion euros, before the Bank realized that something was wrong.
And is unveiled, it seems, this still does not work well with the management of risk in the investment banking.
"With the case Adoboli manifests that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, Professor of Economics and finance at the banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The Chief Financial Officer of a large German bank is also safe: "the problem of the UBS is not domina risk controls".
What emerged the idea of the caution with which Swiss Bankers were long time, be the guardians of the major assets of the world: any too large risk, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
Security of the Swiss bank deposits were the symbol of reliability unwavering, authentic chocolate Sprüngli and Lindt.
The central of UBS in Zurich does not fit with the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, is only slightly larger.
The situation is classical.
The Bank is headquartered in the Bahnhofstraße street of Zurich, which goes directly from the main station to the Lake of Zurich, framed by the peaks covered with snow of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentatious, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here were among jewelry stores like Tiffany's Swiss traditional businesses like the Sprüngli confectionery.
Living here years Swiss banks: from the National Bank, passing by the Palace of Credit Suisse, until the elitarios banks private Julius Bär.
It enters the reception room of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble, coated front are big leather armchairs, next to the logo of the Bank there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what customer search here: security.
Two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, sometime has shifted the idea of the big Swiss Bank, or have betrayed her, and believes the President of a small Swiss private bank.
Prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, at the end and all makes, as all Swiss Bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, is of the opinion, mainly in the investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
Hence the Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have grown accustomed long customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed Anglo-Saxon investment banking, gave his first big gain and then came the disaster, any European financial institution had lost so much money in the jungle of the high risk as the great Swiss Bank.
October 15, 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"This Wednesday the coalition Government of the small country of seven million decided the largest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("the crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicians granted up to 68 thousand million francs or about 45 billions of euros to save the Bank from bankruptcy.
How can you think of?
Talks with Swiss Bankers, so see the problem in the dimension of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the big three Swiss banks merge in a powerful Consortium.
Arises a bank which, due to the merger, was too large for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
By serving so that two different banks precursor of UBS complemented: a rich Bank but slept with the center of the property management in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment banks came in a timely manner with lots of money, which could make shooting a great financial bicycle.
There are two names associated with this rise in UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the consortium of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the modest intellectual who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to break through from learning in the Bank up to the Summit."
Finally, Ospel fió of Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake: "Thought that their models were a reality," said Geiger.

However, responsible business advisers drew attention to a weak point: in the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, the UBS began an affair which almost costs him his existence.
Eager for growth, they invested the same bank as one of its hedge funds created in American investments of high risk.

You must find a strategy for a Bank, to which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banks, has an idea, put an end to the investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The Bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But the investment banking must be reduced much, is clear now.

Ermotti wants to return to the Bank of investment to its State in the mid-1990s.
Suppresses 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is?
With what you want to earn money?

Intelligent rooks extends in the cities
In many places the rooks are considered "problematic birds": does not eject these inteligentísimos animals of the cities for a long time, say experts.
Some like them, others want to rid very quick of them, los grajos belong for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities accumulate complaints from the neighbors by the mess and noise of animals.
Although no means against "troublesome birds" so far has not appeared.
Los grajos already not leave the cities, say experts at the first Symposium on rooks in reading, East Frisia.
There nationwide specialists discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the migration of certain protected rooks; chemical applications in agriculture just visibly with traditional living space.
Hunting, growing building and tree falls that old hinder the life of birds.
The rooks are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 couples breeding in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the Northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as read.
A controversial project to kill en masse to the rooks in the district he jumped into the negative headlines there in 2005.
Critics have described the hunting of animals using traps for birds and the murder with sticks as especially brutal.
"Expelling them and driving them in a normal manner not achieved anything" said Werner Klöver, City Planner and landscape architect to read.
Shoot with water to nests or pulling trees tend to be unintended consequences, also says Manfred Kaiser, Lahr, Baden-Württemberg environmental expert.
"Animals deviate, large colonies of divide and distribute elsewhere."
Scare them is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, homes for the elderly or schools.
"We have to live with them, now we don't grasp."
Without the surroundings, is does not solve the problem in the cities, believes Wolfgang Kellner, Mayor of reading.
A combination of scare off animals sensitive residential areas and baits to return to settle in other places is possible.
"Informative panels instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, Ethnologist and psychologist makes advertising against in order to be animals in a totally different way: "it is best that we can take a peak in the face with aplomb."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein circuit enseñanza sobre los grajos of Ascheberger, where signs tell about the life of smart birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by the tourists.
Jürgens also has its own opinion about criticisms by the noise of birds: "all are forms of communication, they have much to say."
Intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, the rooks not only using resources for accessing snacks schists, if not who make high-end tools to use as resources.
Recently, ethologists of the University of Cambridge found in four rooks far comes the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they should drop a stone on a platform to thus achieve a moth larva.
Without much training, they recognized with determining the size and shape to take the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second trial, the clever rooks should solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a larva of a moth in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach its prey with the beak.
But the researchers were left a piece of wire.
That the four animals formed a hook, which caught the cube in the shooter of the tube.
Three of the four rooks did at the first attempt.

Massacre on a personal level
The intense and generous new book by Peter Englund, the beauty and pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): an intimate story about the first world war, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one you collapse the soul at the foot."
Here are some tips for action: gently start this page and turn it into your brand pages.
Come to know very well these people the novelistic narrative of Mr Englund, and this dramatis personae will act as your GPS, a beacon for those few moments in which, as one of its men and women, is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a historian and Swedish journalist.
It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awarded the Nobel Prize for literature.
What has been written here is an unusual book, aptly, as "a work of anti-historia" describes.
It contains some important treaties, notable names or famous battles; There is virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions about tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains, "a book about how it happened". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and States of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle" combines the experiences in times of war more or less 20 men and ordinary women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.""
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, or will lose its members, become insane or die.
Their lives flickering here as votive candles lit in a church; new ones are added to the mixture while others turn off.
The book of Mr Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a corrective to the notion that the first world war was only the disastrous war of trenches on the Western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves from an expert form through other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, Eastern Africa.
The soldiers in this book they fall above beehives; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a poignant book, almost from the beginning.
The war fills the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a Hurricane Katrina that reeks of cordite.
When artillery fire can be heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, you're or huyes?
Anyway who come from?
Almost no one understands what is happening, nor even why have to fight this war.
"Lack of facts", observes Mr Englund, "is filled with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor of the high seas fleet.
Their stories have been mostly memoirs, letters and other material previously published.
Explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but are more full of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details of Mr Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and cope with what there is.
About the story of a German schoolgirl says: "Substitutes substitutes everywhere".
"Ersatz coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, bands of paper, wood buttons."
Continues talking about the substitute lunch in Germany.
It describes "meat made from rice cooked and pressed in mutton fat (and topped); with a false bone made of wood" tobacco made of roots and dry potatoes peladuras; "shoes with wooden soles".
There are notes, "837 permitted substitutes for meat in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honour and value.
An American recognizes its own momentum towards savagery and expresses about the war: "Feel that, after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit on chairs with a cigar and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best seller, and pretend that veneer means civilization and there is a barbarian behind that frayed washed and studded."
On the other hand a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that nobody will know or will mind.
"Once one is resigned to the thought of sacrifice, one would like to think that it could happen in front of the audience", writes.
On the other hand, it is horribly similar "to a convicted person being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and new types of terror.
"The conflict has become increasingly more in economic competition," writes Mr Englund, "a war between factories".
Reflects an influx of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: the murderer in eloquent and convinced mass ideologically with clothes of good clothing running its carnage while seated behind a desk".
People behave in unexpected ways; There are both ignoble behavior as heroic.
Mr Englund speaks of the soldiers who attempted to actively take a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way of avoiding the service at the front.
"The more grotesque expression of this can see the trade of gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and thereby embadurnan their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rubbed it over his eyes, which often leads to blindness in for life."
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, the prose of Mr Englund agile but not extravagant, is perfectly adapted to their human task.
In dozens of small scenes reflects the way in which the war to "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders are doing them to combat.
The best books about the first world war have often been indirect, as the great war and modern memory Paul Fussell, or novels without new in front Erich Maria Remarque, rather than comprehensive histories.
The volume of Mr Englund joins a pantheon of unconventional.
His book has one of the endings more devastating that I can remember in a work of non-fiction.
I daresay not.
But it is as if it had come from his book, torn between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and had burned her with a match.
After a faux pas prior, an assault planned to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
He chose the night of Monday to Tuesday because the Zuccotti Park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, saying initially to others that were joining an exercise.
The inspector of police Raymond w. Kelly was at the Center, their presence underlined how the operation plagued of challenges to the Police Department.
They could not repeat the episodes in recent weeks, as the spraying of spray pepper on the protesters, infringe the Department regulations and creating a storm of public sympathy for the "squatters".
And that is why the police operation to clear the Park Zuccotti of demonstrators was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared seeing as occupations had been developed in other cities.
A simulacrum of major catastrophe was taking place at Randalls Island, with one eye looking Zuccotti.
Agents increased the so-called training of disorders - measures contraterroristas involving quickly mobilize a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on the night of Monday, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders of entering the Park arrived at the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"A few cops I know that they were called to this, they were not told that it was to enter the Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were in the highest levels of the Department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On 14 October, some officers wanted to clear the Park, but withdrew when hundreds of protesters emerged soon after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved agents of various police units, including special forces of the borough - dozens of mobile agents that usually used to flood the neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming from the Park during the day, making the 1 am a good time to enter.
"Was appropriate to do so when it was the lowest number of people in the Park," he said.
The emergency services unit with lights and speakers trucks congregated at the intersection of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages which rumbled from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community Affairs officers went to the park with their light blue Windbreak, many demonstrators simply collected his things and left.
Not was played no shop until the 1: 45 a.m., said the police, giving time to the demonstrators to gather their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering on the perimeter to enter if needed make arrests in the Park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul j. Browne, the Police Department chief spokesman, said that it was for their safety.
But many journalists said it attempted to prevent firsthand to the police action in the Park, and they had been treated roughly by agents.
Mr Browne said that mobile units of television in Church Street, along the western edge of the Park, could capture images.
As the police moved westward through the dense maze of personal effects of the protestors, including baggage and crowded clothes, paper and plastic garbage bags the Department of cleaning equipment followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, appearing images on the Internet shortly afterwards.
A core group of protesters took positions near the kitchen area of the camp, near the center of the Park.
Some made a barrier, and the police came to arrest them methodically.
Surrounding about 10 people in the epicentre of the camp are they candaron among them by the arms.
And two people encadenaron to trees, said Mr Kelly.
Emergency services officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests in the park were made until about 3: 30 a.m., said Mr Kelly.
The clearance operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the Park.
Most of the arrests were for "disruption of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The agent of highest rank in the scene was Joseph j. Espósito, the head of the Department, the senior uniformed in the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the Chief of detectives of the Department, was also there.
Mr Kelly, while he was present, "was not conducting operations," said Mr Browne.
A second group of agents waiting along the side East Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, where they were to enter.
Rose barricades in the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and the Pine Street, a block to the South.
From these positions, was the police expand the scope even further than the Zuccotti Park.
At any given time, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people in the northern perimeter.
Some of the louder action of the night took place to the South of the Park.
Around 5 a.m., to the South of the Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing the air from a police van wheels.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd.
In the end, an agent and one protester were hospitalized.
The Trade Union of workers of support will demand to the city by the dismissals
The Union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory because of its disproportionate impact on schools serving poor students.
The demand is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the Union, of the municipal district 37, in his effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two assistants of the school, parent coordinators and other employees that were among the worst paid in the city lost their jobs on 7 October, in a move that Union leaders have described as a political payback for his refusal to allow, last spring, the city access to a Fund of health care carried out by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied the accusation.
At a hearing at the Town Hall last month, the Minister of education, Dennis M. Walcott, said the dismissals were a part of the budget approved in June.
A member of the Council countered saying that nothing in the budget specified that the members of the support staff of the school would be dismissed.
Borough 37 officials said they presented the claim in writing, warning that it would be sued the Department of education. Be held a press conference on Wednesday to announce the official presentation of the demand in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Demand will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of education of the city as defendants, and has eight workers dismissed as plaintiffs, all women black or Latino, like the majority of workers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the Legal Department of the city, said that the city had not seen demand and therefore could not to comment on specific allegations.
According to a demand draft obtained by The New York Times, the Union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendees, that had been insufficiently supported chronically.
Stated that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers lost their jobs in the 23rd District in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in 8 districts and 9 in the South Bronx.
Taking into account the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students living in poverty, demand says, "This is not a neighbourhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.S. District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way in which estimated the additional funding for each enrolment for poor school student.
The Union also claims that principals of secondary schools may have been deceived by the language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of coordinators of parents.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, despite the fact that "surplus" describes the Act of moving a master of the payroll of a school a job board, whose salaries are paid by the central office with greater frequency.
"Sixty-six parents coordinators were dismissed," says the draft complaint, "and not only in surplus".
Completed mission, Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion were to succeed, that the veteran dictator Muammar-Gaddafi was captured and killed, and the participation of United States came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat of Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican from Arizona) and Joseph i. Lieberman (Connecticut independent), applauding the Libyans by his successful rebellion and the troops of the United States.UU. for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the brave Libya, we begin to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It's an affirmation of bipartisan support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties quarrelled among themselves and with the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the military in the United States.UU. the Mission of NATO in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution that authorizes the limited use of military forces of the United States.UU. in Libya.
Bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and which was never voted on in the Senate.
But the same day that Bill was rejected in the House, the Chamber also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for American operations in Libya.
That left the Mission of EE.UU. in a kind of purgatory Legislative - Congress upset enough to criticize the handling by Obama of the mission, but not so angry to really reap the grass under their feet.
Then, the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "congratulates the people of Libya for his tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to liberate themselves" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of United States and its coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for his extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measure will gain the full support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or divide lawmakers as it did Bill of June?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard g. Lugar (Indiana), the main Republican of the Committee.
The place spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen yet the final version of the new Bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Congressional Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia Republican), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic that in fact achieves a vote of the whole House in the House or the Senate during this Congress.
Other legislators have failed so far to bring their amendments to the Assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicates - the same draft law proposes both in the Chamber and in the Senate--and others with slight variations among themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment just budgetary balance in the camera, and another handful who "monitor federal spending."
Some of these bills are also identical to each other, but give their sponsors - especially beginners Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of such a measure.
The budget Control Act, which was approved in August, required that both the House and the Senate voted a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution that supported the idea of this amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of Congress can meet, while Representative José e. Serrano (Democrat-New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for Presidents.
The representative Jesse l. Jackson Jr. (Democrat-Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to a quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment prohibiting gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one prohibiting the burning of flags.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the States.
As enthusiasts who have been members in proposing amendments, are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111 Congress, lawmakers proposed amendments 77 and made 66 in the 110 °.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the early 1990s, when the members regularly presented 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the library of the Senate.
But they had no more success then of what they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was in fact proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Battered but not defeated," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shooting him at point-blank range at a Tucson constituent Act, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Arizona Democrat) appeared on national television Monday night, he sang accompanied by the Broadway Melody "the sun goes tomorrow" and said that he wanted to recover more than what I wanted to return to Congress.
In his appearance on ABC News "20: 20" with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The programme documented their difficult way back of the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that pass from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned by surprise to the camera to triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the shooting in January, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, is rio and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked him how it feels, Giffords, of 41 years, replied: "Quite well".
Interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20: 20" of one-hour, which aired the eve of the publication of the new book by the couple, "Gabby: A story of courage and hope".
The special program analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in his hospital bed, with a shaven head and a long scar across his forehead.
She can only maintain one or two erect fingers, while her husband encouraged.
Months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair while therapists teach how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A fruncimiento of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What?".
In a few days, Giffords gave another word - "toast", a request for change in its breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: is the Congressman to singing the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Cyndi Lauper and Tom Petty's "Free Falling" along with the therapists.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, makes two hours of therapy every day, said that he does not remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that an article in the newspaper about the assassination on March 12 when she stopped him to ask first about the six who died in the incident I was reading him to Giffords.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and is being medicated by force while awaiting trial.
"Many people died", he told Giffords to Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of recovery of his wife, she said: "I have been defeated."
"So I told him,"' Gabby, not have been defeated,' "Kelly said."
"Just you've been hit."
"You gonna get out of this, gonna recover and are going to come back stronger than ever."
The troops felt more pity that I respect
The event was a gala of Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for Veterans homeless in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about the powerlessness, frustration and loss.
At that time, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines stormed their positions around him.
The multitude of label stood up and they applauded.
"The men and women were regarded as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising of spring.
A military officer of high rank in the gala, also known as the then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops in a different way.
The official "Showed them as a kind of orphan", wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
They had them.
But it wasn't respect for truth. It was pity.
The sharply conflicting views illustrate the difficult relationship that has seized the military and often distant American audiences, sometimes, worshiper.
Troops was lavished with praise by their sacrifices.
But the praise has a price, say members of the service.
The public increasingly acts more as if give penalty those uniformed.
"We're not victims at all," said Sean B. MacFarland brigadier general, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon depart towards Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way that some show their support is put to us in the role of helpless souls."
The issue is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who don't want to seem desagradecidos or disagree with the public they serve.
Also realize that anger that faced the troops who returned in the last years of the war of Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, most pity talks carried out in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two children returned from combat with the Marine Corps, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them of people apart from the military would consider its service from two perspectives.
Some look them with a feeling of fear because it clashed with the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others will wonder if there would be a "veteran angry and violent beneath the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high level of the Government working in Washington.
During their search for employment, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked subtly if he would be able to endure under the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, need to deal with negative perceptions," recalled Cancian telling their children.
Arises the military concern, part of American indifference toward the wars.
Accomplishments on the battlefield are rarely chosen to praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, already not value the military heroism in ways which were quite common in World War II", said the retired lieutenant general David Barno, who commanded the troops of the United States.UU. in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are renowned for the number of tours that have withstood, the number of friends who have lost or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces increasing pressure to put an end to the violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide if 28 women and men have a case against the army for its alleged passivity before the violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are being organized for the following.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnancy the night in which she says that she was raped by a fellow.
It was October of 2008, and was headed back to his headquarters at the Miramar Air Base, North of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a package of 12 cans of beer.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It sounded an alarm signal," says Lyman.
However, the Texas native left aside its concern.
I thought, no, it has 19.
"Texas is", says.
"I wish I had listened to my instincts."
Within minutes of entering the room of Lyman, the man approached him from behind, pulling it down and raping her, alleges.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and other current and former military personnel's 27 members anxiously a judicial decision in a historic trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed, the reduction of rape widespread among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Presented in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., demand initially implied to 17 plaintiffs, but it grew to 28 in the following months, 25 men and three women, all of them claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by co-workers, and that the army failed to investigate, prosecute, or deliver justice appropriate after the alleged assaults.
Burke said that it goes to the staff of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure from top to bottom", says.
"Who are people who are able to eradicate the culture of retaliation?" "The high command."
Burke also said that since February, have been in touch with her about 400 survivors, many of which could be part of future demands.
His strategy: rather than accumulate all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in the same basket, so to speak, will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, headed by the federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detailed defence strategy - in essence, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers by the injuries sustained in the armed forces.
A 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal Government is not responsible for the damage sustained by the staff in active service.
"Alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs," the documents say.
The Department of Defense refused to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially forbidden to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern warfare rarely have clear the front lines.
Both Iraq and Afghanistan soldier women teams are playing increasingly important roles, to reach local women in war zones especially.
The result: between these two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two thirds of them in combat situations.
It is time that the army also modernized, said Burke.
She is not alone in their struggle, and other three demands are underway, as well as the yours.
The Yale Law School, legal services for Veterans clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academies promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the Organization non-profit Viet Nam Veterans of America is composing a lawsuit against the army which focuses on "personality disorder" diagnosis assigned to rape victims in order to give discharge from the service - a common event, according to activists, as Anu Bhagwati of the action women's network in servicea human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way that handles claims for benefits for persons claiming to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine Bills have been submitted separately in Congress by a bipartisan mix of Senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there was 3.158 sexual assaults reported, according to the Office for Sexual assault prevention and response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are remarkably below reported, and by the own estimates of the Pentagon, which figure in about 13.5 percent of the 19000 ladies incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines levels of processing: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases reported in the Army went to trial - half that the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke, described their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, denounced the alleged violation to the military police less than an hour before it happened.
That night, he says, was asked that you had details of his rape 11 times than a crowd of policemen, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and the blood of its aggressor - of a cut on his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which asked about that had sexual relations with her boyfriend the day of the attack.
Six people declared to be witnesses of personality on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day on which was read the verdict", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to go to work - I found myself screaming from the room."
"They put me in the Psychiatry Unit, and when I came out, I remember that I told my command officer," "That was not his view." "That was my opinion."
Lyman was ordered visit to a military psychiatrist, who finally diagnosed with a personality disorder, which made it unsuitable for the service.
In January 2010 she was provided services under least-that-Honorable terms, prevents him from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case presented by Lyman and his companions of demand continues, is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of law at George Washington law school.
However, points out, "in my opinion, they should be able to proceed".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine which has been criticized since that was published for the first time.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it has the same incentive and deterrence arising from the liability.
And adds: "the odds are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try."
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the audience is not going his way, Burke, Attorney for the plaintiffs, will make the queue to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases.
"We will continue fighting against the army in this topic until that reform occurs," he said.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first."
The walls have eyes: how researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was simply another type that aireaba their views anti-immigration online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having carried out a massacre in Norway in July, which left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, was far from being alone in cyberspace: had spent most of the time that preceded his attack against your computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But, how to find them?
Easy - just enter on Facebook.
"We realized that was not so difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British Studies Center DEMOS.
The cache of personal information of Facebook is so encyclopedic, Bartlett, says that researchers could simply use advertising tool to determine its desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way that marketers have been using for years.
The team of Bartlett found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then addressed them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
Arriving through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 Parties of extreme right in 11 European countries - all without leaving the Office.
"Is an entirely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: supporters in line of right-wing groups tend to be young people, men and angered by immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those that combine their activism online with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, political scientists and medical researchers are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in the "I like" messages in the walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users by adding an average of three pieces of content a day, "supernova data" of Facebook is generating a rise of research, driving the number of scholarly works with the site name in the title to almost 800% in the past five years.
To some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that he allows you to study people who not you could get with a folder in the street.
"Before, when you right to the British national party people survey, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to go through the party, and they never allow you access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook eliminates everything that - go to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues, found that college students who spoke of his exploits of drunkenness on Facebook had a risk significantly greater of having problems with the drink than the students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggested that fellow students, such as residential advisors, could control the site and intervene to help a student to publish too many updates of State with their drunkenness.
"Not you can treat a problem if you can not diagnose", said Dimitri Christakis, the co-author of Moreno and director of the center of health, behavior and development of the child in child Research Institute in Seattle, said the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise would be undiagnosed."
Facebook also is constantly "clicking" to its own population to obtain data.
The team of site data has produced statistics on the State of the relationship and Valentine's day, the expectation of turnout halfway through the 2010 legislative period, and national happiness index (mainly using the information which can be accessed - digital freedom defenders for a long time that they argue that the site should be available other his large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, them like it or not - the sacrifice by to play Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away is to allow site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey do not even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free toolbar for all.
"I don't think that many users have thought even the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, on a 2006 study conducted with the public walls of Facebook's students.
"In so far as they concerned, it was only between themselves and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a subject of investigation this being completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know that some of the information from the profile of a user and the wall messages are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
It is why, despite his years as technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper clip and a pen remained the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute to enter the real world and talk to real people," he said.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social still happens offline."
"Cold and inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court"
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the mastermind of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance at the Court of Oslo.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and the Templar Knights of Norway," he told a room full with 500 people.
"I am opposed to the Court that he received the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology of hatred, and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit the facts but I plead not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim disrupted Breivik for this monologue, because "he didn't give Breivik the opportunity to use the hearing as a platform to express their points of view".
For the same reason it refused to allow Breivik, which brought a speech written in advance, go to relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 weeks, forbidden access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would have to have a strict control over all the visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that it is confined under lock and key.
All attended with the objective of moving towards the conclusion.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked to the journalists and the survivors in the eyes when he entered and left the building.
Despite the strange notion of Breivik of being part of a greater "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not mentally ill, and said that there is no evidence that act with accomplices.
It is possible that some them consuele that attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that does not automatically softens the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I'd like that, it seems, a monster, but it doesn't," said a family member of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it seems."
7 Lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, are shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on 5 October, there were some comparing it with Henry Ford - distinguishing the genius of technology as the great modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in an interview with Jobs recently rediscovered to which has dusted and advancement of a number of major markets this week, special projections is understood how much this creative mind on business processes and workflows of the products.
It was certainly a designer, dreamer and autorreconocido hippie, but it was also a meticulous organiser and a junkie of flow diagrams - a man who believed that many executives were suffering "a disease that consists in thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work..." "[but] there is a tremendous amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (the triumph of idiots) on the dawn of the personal computer, and sat for more than one hour with Jobs for a rare and extensive conversation.
At that time they had barely 10 years passed since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple and already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, hoping the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview of Cringely used in Nerds, said that the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after the death of Jobs who discovered a complete copy on VHS in the garage of the director.
This file, slightly reissued material is the basis of Steve Jobs: the lost interview, 68 minutes, reaching this Landmark theaters Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating on in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose their technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are large silences between the questions and responses - from 10 to 15 seconds of thoughts, where Jobs is considering clear their thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also times where Jobs perfectionism comes to the surface, where it seems impatient due to questions of Cringely, pushing him to move faster towards issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there something strangely prophetic in the lost interview, when Jobs assesses what he sees that other companies make good and bad, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
Read posthumous assessments of the race of Jobs is one thing, but there is something raw and inspiring in the Jobs that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of as they can and they should be things.
Not long after explaining everything in detail here, was and did.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always wondered:" "why do things?" and the answers that give you of invariable form are: "Oh, that's just the way as is done".
No one knows why it does what it does, business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
This is what I found.
Jobs leads to detail its efforts to simplify the accounting of Apple.
Baffled by the way in there were costs - often starting with a "standard cost" that made eye of good cubero, and then he met with a "variable" - developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs to detail.
On the joke to the Pope:
The "blue box" which he tells jobs built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people hack effectively to the telephone company and make free long-distance calls.
He has written widely on the device, but the euphoria of Jobs here to describe the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box through the use of a public telephone, making a call, and then connecting from an AT &amp;amp;amp; T network to another, while creating a loop with the greatest possible number of satellites.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half-dozen times and you gritabas through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public telephone on the door of the side", said Jobs with a giggle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We two, we didn't know much, but could build something small that could control a giant thing - was an amazing lesson, and I don't think that Apple would have never existed without it.
Jobs continues describing a glorious joke that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the blue box in the middle of the night and asking to speak with the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter rather than the Pope himself was awakened to go to answer the phone.
On falling in love of technology (and selling) by telephone with Bill Hewlett:
At the age of 12 years, hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he sought out Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after his telephone conversation of 20 minutes, Jobs got a job of part-time summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a notable influence on me, was the only company that had seen at that age and formed my view of what was a company and well dealing with its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company in Palo Alto research laboratories, where he saw "the first desktop ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen cathode tube, and I fell in love with him.
You would a trip to HP as a teenager and would waste time with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, that he devoted himself to sell a handful of motherboards, asked a customer whether he could mount the entire team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the Assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, remember the struggles they faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... yelled that they would need five years [to create a mouse which would cost $300], and I harté and I went outside and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
On large firms losing strength:
Much before that he lead the revival of Apple, Jobs prophetically anticipated the way that many industry leaders encounter in his vision, and would lose control of its market share.
"Say that you work at IBM or Xerox, by what you do best printers, and photocopiers and what?"
You have the monopoly of the market share, which is why the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so are this kind of people ending for directing the companies and persons responsible for products are expelled from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products that led to this monopoly position flavr savr because of people who do not have the notion of good vs bad products products - knowledge of the necessary ex officio.
That is what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been taken over the computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as artistic expression:
"There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... that evolves the great idea, change and grow."
He learned a lot about the subtleties of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things that you can do to make the electrons, makes them the glass, make them robots, make them the factories.
You have to maintain 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - adjust them all at the same time...
At the end all comes down to taste - it lowers to try to expose you to maybe a human team has done, and then trying to adapt those things that your're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have never had shame about stealing great ideas.
What did partly grande to the Macintosh was that persons who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which coincidentally were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it were not for the computer, it could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dine with rivals of the law on health care while the Court accepts the case
The day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of if would accept the challenge to the law of health care of the Obama President, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will expose the case to the High Court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met at a preliminary hearing to study carefully the requests for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 States challenging the total reform of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
Judges agreed to admit the demand for processing and, indeed, expected an historic allegation of 5 hours and a half to March, and the result probably even more enturbiará the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time that the decision of the Court is known.
The lawyer who appear before the Court and said that the law should be disposed of will probably be Paul Clement, who served as attorney general of the United States.UU. during the George w. Bush administration.
The law firm of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society, a group that has been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations who challenged the law, the National Federation of independent business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, hours after the preliminary hearing of the tribunal on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leading Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the law on health care.
The special dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
It is nothing new: the two judges have been attending the federalist society events for years.
And is not something that enters into conflict with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were not, arguably they would fall under the Canon code 4 c, which reads: "A judge can attend events to raise funds of organizations concerned with the law and others, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or be on the agenda of such an event."
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest was enough to alarm activists of ethics in Government.
"This impressive gap of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several Magistrates Court that abides by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (common cause).
"The judges were treated in a fundraising gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the Court."
His appearance and assistance in fund-raising for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest by critics who say that too easily mixed the activity of the tribunal with the agenda driven groups such as the federalist society.
And the wife of Thomas, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is judge Elena Kagan, which has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as solicitor general of the Administration Obama when the first legal challenges to the law were in the Court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan to refrain from see the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law as to now be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that he will.
Boeing receives a record order of $ 18 billion
Emirates airline calls 50 aircraft of twin aisle Boeing 777, with option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at more than one billion dollars.
Rarely is news when a company obtains an order for 50 units of your product.
But is a great transaction when the company is the manufacturer of aircraft Boeing Co. and the price of sale for 50 aircraft amounted to a record of $ 18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growth of future orders for aircraft.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago company estimated over the next 20 years in Middle East airlines require 2,520 aircraft amounting to $ 450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its more big order history for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - 50 Jet Boeing 777 twin aisle.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the sales price total to 26 billion dollars, Boeing announced the 2011 Dubai air show.
Then, on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts a saving of fuel and services for passengers spectacular.
The price of sale for six of them is more than one billion dollars.
"This is clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said analyst Morningstar Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these clients in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the middle are the property of their oil-producing Nations.
Therefore, not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, but that a rise in prices of fuel - generally harmful for the airlines, because it is one of the major costs - is not so harmful, because the country is earning money with the increase in the price of oil.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay orders of flight when fuel prices rise, said Dihora.
"Have a natural protection, he said.
The order of the Emirates solidifies the leadership of Boeing widebody market and helps to keep at Bay the attempt of its competitor Airbus SAS invade his domain with the A350 airliner.
Of Boeing of air fair victory comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
Delayed debut to add more momentum after that customers require an increase in payload and range.
Shares of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $67,94.
The sister of President Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón says that the drug traffickers helped his opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the race for Governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón appears to have lost his candidacy to Governor of Michoacán during the violent state elections, and she said on Monday that the drug traffickers helped tilt the race for one of his opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for Governor of the Western State Fausto Vallejo, of the institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of crime organized throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the entire country," said Luisa María Calderón, in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers..." "They took over the polls, set up barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the Presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a return, and the win in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome narrow Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of the Conservative Party of national action of his brother, or bread, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently occupies the position of Governor, was in third place, a major defeat for the unfortunate and divided left before the presidential elections in 2012.
You aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, senior of the from the State capital of Morelia, denied links with drug trafficking and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been long dominated by drug cartels specialize in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military offensive directed against traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A mayor of bread was assassinated a week before the election while he was campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates left the local candidates for fear.
But for the PRI, unpalatable as they may appear the Michoacan elections, a victory will help drive the party.
The man supposed represent the PRI in presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think that this victory should be very encouraging to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help to bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has appealed to India and China that they prepare to help bail out the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a recession in the long term that would impede the growth of the Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, director-general of the Asian Development Bank, based in Manila, said that two large economies of more rapid growth in the world, had to "do everything possible" to speed up the recovery of the economic bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries who observe the difficulties of Europe in an "impartial" manner and said that financial assistance from Asia along with leadership and European resources would help avoid a crisis in the global economy long-term.
"We are all together in this."
"So anyone that can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", told the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but cannot be immune."
"Thus if Chinese and India can help, either by all means."
European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy borrowing costs have soared dangerously and Italy and Greece the Prime Ministers have resigned.
The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to come together to help find a solution to the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support of Asia is channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the bonds of the EU, the European financial stability Fund rescue fund - offered a greater bargaining power for the Asian partners in Europe.
Indian Commerce Minister Anand Sharma said that "the India is going to do everything we can" to help the eurozone since its own economy was now suffering from the fall in exports and the inflow of foreign capital depletion.
"Nobody wants that the eurozone will remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not an option, it is an imperative, because to find a jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women.?"
Others argue that as India, developing economies have no responsibility in helping rich Europeans when faced with their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States.UU., said that it would be politically very difficult to sell the Europe aid for the million two hundred thousand people of the India, of which up to 800 million living on close to $2 a day or less.
"At some point you will see Greeks retire at the age of 50 years and go on vacation to the beaches and that will not fall well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why the reserves of the India should be used to keep numerous and well-paid workers in the Greek public sector, jobs of poorly managed companies, and loss as the railways.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis threatens "important effects in chain" throughout Asia.
The prognosis of the Asian Development Bank of 7.5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing the "downside risks" due to the threat of Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets needed "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant of capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings about possible cuts in Defense Pentagon
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, heated the Congress on Monday, warning that automatic budget cuts that looming could undermine national security and cause a financial chain reaction from the corridors of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civil assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digested the 450 billion dollars of cuts over the next decade, but now feared a further reduction of 600 billion or more that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending cuts.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican from Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "abduction", would give place to 23 per cent of global reductions and an end to many new projects.
"Such large cuts, applied in this indiscriminate way, would that most of our naval projects and construction can not run - cannot buy three-quarters parts of a boat or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also have to set aside many of our civil servants unintentionally, and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilian in order to fulfil the objective."
"These changes would break faith with those who hold our army and would seriously damage the willingness."
The cuts eventually would reach the combat troops, said Panetta.
"While financing for times of war in the accounts of overseas contingency operations is not directly affected by the kidnapping, the war effort will be affected negatively by the serious disruption in the budgets of base", said Panetta.
"The recruitment of staff be reduced, which led to delays in contracts and the supervision of the contract that supports the war."
"Staff on the payroll would be reduced, leading to delays in payments to providers in time of war, and the legal and political support would be adjourned."
The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The result of a kidnapping in the Department of Defense cause a rapid decline of the United States as a major world military power."
"We are firmly against this draconian action," said the senators in a joint communiqué the afternoon on Monday when they published the letter from Panetta.
"This is not a result that you can live, and is certainly not one that we should impose to us themselves."
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security of the United States interests, and should not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta letter and recent warnings from the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon cuts it remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly more franco on possible cuts, despite the fact that he arrived to work at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it was facing difficult decisions.
At a Conference of press last week, Defense Secretary painted a grim picture of what could be ahead - an army with a shell, but not a core.
"It's a boat without sailors."
"It is a Brigade without bullets."
"It is an air wing without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and pumps without sufficient troops trained to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his remarks opening at the Pentagon.
"It is a force plagued by low morale, poor preparation and isn't able to keep abreast with potential adversaries."
"Indeed, it invites aggression..."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta set out new details of how the reductions "generated significant operating risks: delay in the time of crises, conflicts and disaster response;" It severely limits our ability to be deployed and committed previously throughout the world; "and it is an unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those that already are being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes the jet fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new bomber planned, the ballistic submarine of new generation, the new boat of littoral combat and the new fighting vehicle on the ground that the army and Navy need to replace the humvee.
Stop development and additional evidence of the F35 could generate $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years, but his supporters say he is the next vital step to improve and deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A look at the latest headlines shows us how serious and pervasive are deception and lies in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each party accuses of lying to the other.
The Pennsylvania State University administrators have been accused of perjury by allegedly hiding reports claiming that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, was "caught" with an open microphone saying to the President of the United States.UU., Barack Obama, that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and shaking countries.
The Congressman from New York and exhibitionist in Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the ridiculous with his denials soon belied by the irrefutable proof.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of violations in the campaign financing related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, anyone who lived ever forget the circus media unleashed by President Bill Clinton to lie during his second mandate about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends about the traps in the school and University exams are widespread.
There have been cases in which teachers have given responses of examinations to students in order to be better seen in their assessments of performance.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception are we?
In one day, studies show that they can lie you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
This safe, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that unknown people lied three times in the first 10 minutes of knowing.
Detect lies, or "the location of lies", is a skill essential to that we must acquire all, for reasons both personal and professional.
Far from being a board game similar to, for example, charade, where the objective is to exclaim: "I have you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the past six decades in prestigious universities that conducted research projects in depth, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the investigation is that the old myths about the lies have been contested.
Liars did look to the eyes.
Not always they stutter, stutter, is ruborizan or uneasy.
It cannot conclude either that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can reach the truth learning about the structure of the Declaration, microfaciales expressions, the formation of questions and times.
I spent years probing the scientific discoveries about the deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of deception is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps to navigate our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include recruitment, interviews, or the management of negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, making them feel comfortable driving their own emotions and feeling so intuitive how perceive them others.
We know from research that the Extroverts lie more than the introverted, men say more "oriented themselves lies", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - who married persons lie less frequently to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies that say tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you is perceived as a malefactor, others will feel less guilty to lying him.
How to know if someone is lying?
First, note the usual behaviour of the subject.
This is called "create a baseline".
It helps to provide benchmarks to measure changes later.
Note the position of the subject, laughter and vocal feature.
It is better to know if someone normally drum with his foot all the time to not make unjust accusations when see you the feet golpeteando in the middle of the meeting.
Then browse to misleading, verbal and non-verbal behaviour groups.
Consider these groups of behavior as signs of alarm, not as proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body trying to remember its history, you can point your feet towards the door, tilt toward an exit, change its stance significantly or exhibit an "postentrevista outlet" - that exaggerated sigh of relief and change of position after all the difficult questions have been completed.
The interrogators often do see falsely that the interview had completed only to seek such relief postentrevista.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson got the leg to the bottom and used the past tense while he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for it at the national level.
People who cheat also may use a spacer language: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question completely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when answer a difficult question: "well... to be honest... to what I was... in my opinion."
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a sign of warning.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but develop skills to discover the deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid being victimized by the artists of the scam in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan of the oil pipeline diverted after the threat of the delay in the United States.UU. in its approval
Days after administration of Obama threatening to delay the adoption of a pipeline planned from Canada up to the Mexico Gulf - angry unions, while it apaciguaba the ecologists - the company that seeks to build the pipeline says that the project is ready to redirect to move it back.
TransCanada said on Monday night that will move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of Nebraska Sandhills, and hoped that the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
The directors of TransCanada, Alex Pourbax, said that the company maintains its confidence that with time the pipeline will be adopted, while it is true that with a different route.
This comes following the announcement by the State Department last week from it delay the decision by a federal project permission until a new potential routes to avoid the areas of Sandhills of Nebraska and the aquifer Ogallala, a vast supply of groundwater study.
"This is a real way of progress," the representative Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State it is possible that it aside any decision until 2013, after the next year's election, although officials denied that politics was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a statement written last week, described the decision as the request of the State Department, and expressed them their full support.
The pipeline, 1,700 miles extended from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels per day in the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do so, it would be necessary to cross six States.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, which have opted for the estimate of 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska legislators opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the region of Sandhills and the aquifer Ogallala, the major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact of State Department study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the inspector general of the Department has ordered an independent evidence of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the Member of the lobby hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was Advisor to Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to direct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle defendant for allegedly provoking a child vomitara of fear
A family of New York claims that the diva of music album, Patti LaBelle, behaved like a Madwoman in the lobby of his Manhattan building, aterrando his small daughter to the extent that vomited in fear.
The singer of "Lady Marmalade" diatribe frightened Genevieve Monk, 18 months old, so much that he suffered "changes of personality, sleep disorders" and "increased their fear of strangers", says his family in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
It was on 10 November of last year when the tramoyista Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk caught the car, Roseanna Monk came down to the lobby of the building of the Riverside Boulevard, with their luggage, carried Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said that you stood near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
'Someone came up from behind and said,"do you know what your daughter is doing?' I told him "Yes ' and went to take it", said.
LaBelle admonished angry pregnant women.
"He said in an aggressive tone,"Should have passed to his daughter near the gate", said Roseanna Monk."
"I told him,"I have no interest in what you say or think.""
It enraged and began to use bad words - the word (c) and the word J aloud...
"I had a bottle of water and began to pull the water from the bottle on me."
He said that Genevieve was hysterical.
"You I told this woman,"Look what've done you to my daughter,"said the mother of the girl."
LaBelle rushed on the mother - who still holding to Genevieve - and had to be contained by its environment and retreat to a car that was waiting, said Roseanna Monk.
Small was crying so hard that he vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle not returned calls for comment on what happened.
Demand seeks unspecified damages, but the lawyer for the family, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all the money to get an Association of support to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"Such conduct is totally unacceptable, especially when it turns to a teacher of kindergarten carried an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climatic adversity has crippled the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, Sinaloa had increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment, and shrank the economy
2011 Is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of Government of Mario Lopez Valdez, self-styled of change, it generated great expectations with regard to progress in the economy, but given the climatic adversity of beginning of year, there is no growth, is Yes instead registered a deterioration in key indicators of economic development.
Temperatures in February, in addition to causing millions in losses to the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities for the State economy to grow, caused a contraction of economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.

Until November, the fall in economic activity has generated a constant rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of statistics and geography the rate of State unemployment during the three first quarters of the year was observed accelerated growth, because while from January to March 55 thousand sinaloenses 053 were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active populationfor the second quarter the rate was a 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase up to 6.19 per cent, a rate which in number of people cast more than 74 thousand sinaloenses unemployed, increased compared to the first half of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa over the year is multifactorial, to economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, unemployment growth may explain indirectly, based on actions from public policy made.
"What you are seeing is a rise in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market effects of a restriction of resources by legislation approved in the Congress to combat money-laundering, for people to grab $ illicitly him it is no longer easy to work them""to invest them and use something", said.
Migration arrested
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people ranging from the State in search of work abroad, in United States is has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they also have many difficulties in finding a job, these people is running and is demanding sources of work here in the State, which makes unemployment soar"She said.
Informality
Sinaloense labour market analysis is compounded when considering the high level of informality that prevails between the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38% of the employed population in the State serves without being listed as a worker before any institution of social security.
Coupled with unemployment and informality, another of the labour lags of the State are low wages, the entity has lower wages in the country, according to records of the Mexican Institute of Social insurance and the Ministry of labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of sinaloenses workers was, until September, 5 mil 352 pesos, well below the national average, located in 7 thousand 375 pesos.

For its part, the Secretariat of economic development of the State Government accounted for a total investment of 17 thousand 280 million pesos in the year, occurrence of companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government requested in July to the State Congress the adoption of a credit by 3 billion pesos, same that would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, in order to revive the economy, the local Congressional approval was for an amount of 2 billion 600 million pesos, and until November have not seen the benefits of borrowing in any sector of the State economy.

Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of transformation industry, expressed that during 2011 is it lacked the harmonisation of wills of different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy this year in Sinaloa has been really very poor, we must work hard to regain the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we must redouble our efforts, he failed to align the efforts of all and above all good progress already synchronized this new team of Government, we hope that next year will be much better"He said.
Economic slow

Court validates "analogical blackout" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) dismissed constitutional disputes that brought the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree which brings forward the so-called "analogical blackout" from 2021 to 2015, to not join the eight votes needed to override it.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderon did not exceed its powers by issuing the Decree detailing actions to be followed to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional dispute promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected by not reach the qualified majority of eight votes so the Court pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of Decree, and this is existing.
Draft statement, prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional since the regulation of the subjects of radio and television is a power reserved by law to the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and subject to law.
In favour of the draft only voted Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the own Cordero Sánchez.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the Decree, and to admit the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the implementation of the Decree and all actions it ready for the digital transition.
The plenary session of Ministers resolved also dismissed the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Minister President said did not match the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive not to structure through general rules measures for the preparation of the public administration.
"Nor do I think that if did it it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector correspond to the federal executive, who has constitutional mandate, the stewardship of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years, and translates into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better signal quality and more channels.
Defer change, he argued, would be to delay the benefits of digitization, which implies a decision in the public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, stressed, "require the operation of the established system, according to the principle of economic stewardship of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution leads to the Faculty of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and it has done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
No one can conclude that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree that invade the field of competence of the Congress, in some form since the observance of laws issued by the legislative is providing in the administrative field said.
They discussed possibility of a count "vote by vote" in Michoacán
According to data from the PREP the difference between first and second place in the election of Governor is of just 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.

9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) solved the constitutional dispute promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State representative to the constitutional reforms, since it has no right to "punish them or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "vote by vote", Maria of the angels Llanderal explained that the realization of full and partial counts the vote by the local electoral body will be possible with the adoption of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM.
Thus, the partial count of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given on the assumptions that: the results of the proceedings do not coincide; There is the Act of counting and computation in the dossier of the box or not held by the President of the same; or, where there are mistakes or obvious alterations of records.
In addition, the total count of the vote received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is indication that the difference between the alleged winning candidate of the election concerned and which obtained the second place in the vote, is equal to or less than one percentage point; always and when at the beginning of the meeting there is the request of the representative of the party or coalition that ran to the second of the above candidates.
The total vote count may also be performed if at the end of the regular computer establishes the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and located in second place is equal or less than one percentage point, provided there is the request expressed by the representative of the political party whose candidate came second, case in which the electoral packages that have undergone partial recount will be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that in such a situation is the choice of Morelia, where according to the difference between the first and second PREP is only the 0.16 per cent, without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total records.

Will be formed on Wednesday the new Italian Government
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with President Italy to present the new Government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with President Italy to present the new Government that will face a crisis that has placed Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has endangered the eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named on Sunday, will meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it can form a Government.
He is expected to present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new Executive will assume the position.
Monti said that it would submit to the Chairman the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not say explicitly that you can form a Government, but the tone of their comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well outlined," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a Government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to give prisa, the volatility of the markets placed the BTP Italian bond yields, 10 years over 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers, Confindustria, said to the press after meeting with Monti: "We said that we would much support to this Government".
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti were driven significantly by the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result," he told the press Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the LDP, the biggest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the Government of majority technocrat who is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new Government must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or delay in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks joined the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began Monday his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with youth organizations and women.
It put an end to his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi he would resign, Italian debt costs have now turned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new Prime Minister will be successful.
Rescue Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current financial defences of the eurozone.
Monti has said that his Government should last until the next elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that the politicians only give time to implement the reforms before early elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be made only by technicians, an indication of their objections before a process bound by financial pressure.
Political sources noted that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.

"Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of his best concerts on Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says that they will also be turn into reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was stated bassist and founding member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The grouping is South American wing of their tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20 will be his only stopover in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, 7: 30 p. m., angelina band The X and nationals of the Mindaugas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, whose full transcript is in La Nación in Internet.
For Costa Rican fans, is a dream come reality that Pearl Jam will play at Costa Rica, are aware of what their fans are living?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us also.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and holidays; It is a very beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay a few days hence.
So he moves us to take our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band you, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What they say their most ardent followers?
Please stay beside us through all these years.
We took almost 21 years to reach Costa Rica; Thank you for having waited so and regret that us has taken so much time to get up there.
Some people even already refers to his concert as the largest of the year show.
Do add you that a little bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years took place during the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we are very eager to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discovered Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends were always going to surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places for surfing; that was how we learned, through people who love surfing.
To see the tour, they have been delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for presentation at Costa Rica?
As ever we've played there before, then we have no restrictions on what it can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; We will try to play a couple of songs on each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this?
I think that it is partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose which songs play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we while not playing, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us the reasons why we liked these songs and we could have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us, and I therefore believe that also render it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of experience.
Looking back, it is hard to believe all what have been achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
Firstly, I believe that none of us will imagine that we would be in a great rock band and have done so for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We are counting our blessings and much thrilled us that we can continue to make music together.
All we want and we love to create music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world to which we always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What meant for you having been part essential of the emergence of grunge?
An honour to has always been be part of that group of big bands.
We are very friends of the people of Mudhoney and Soundgarden, Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is something unusual.
From time to time arises a band of a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go out at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the group in Seattle.
Still we played with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we are fortunate to still be friends of all of them and we are honored be part of that sound of Seattle that emerged.
Also it is very strange that a band like yours stays United and with the same members therefore time.
Yes, four of us have we are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us to 13 years ago, which, by itself alone, is much longer than many bands last.
Firstly, I think that all are fortunate to still be alive and, secondly, all we care about others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to that, have also opened musical avenues that give freedom to each experience.
We trust each other with the music of each and it could not be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; However, due to its success, they have been able to do whatever they want.
How do they find a balance?
To as we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure that not being too much on tour because it is easy to fall into that game and large crowds of people who loves your music.
While one remember that people are there for the music, that remember you that you must respect the music and what brought her, without encaprichar to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really interested.
How do you remember your other Mother Love Bone project?
I think that we write very good songs in the beginning was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never publish a disk until after that died Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations because both last and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), started the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think in the incredible person that Andy was and how they made me laugh, always it was a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
It was an amazing human being and we miss.
The national band Las Mindaugas is responsible for opening the show on Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know his work, notably Eddie Vedder, and that is why her they chose for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals and that was the band that we liked, so we're anxious to see what the Mindaugas can offer live and duty be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the Yellow Ledbetter lyrics live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings and I think that it does with the first thing that comes to mind.
Bass, what are your influences?
They are so many.
In the first that occur to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They are so many that I could discuss bassists that I love all afternoon.
How has Pearl Jam grunge despite no longer a fashion stay relevant?
I think that all of us always feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all those that emerged at the same time, and, if there is relevance now, I think it is a wonderful thing because it is music that is worth listening to and bands as Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now has become more positive.
Why is this change?
It is interesting because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album that seem perhaps lighter, but there are also songs, as The End or Just Breathe which qualify as very dark songs although they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched me them, I cried when I listened to them and they are deeply obscure songs.
I believe that when you grow and there is some trauma in your life and lost a relative or a friend, those things begin to influence your art and your music and these two songs, no doubt, represent that for me.
Also, I believe that you can be a happy person and still make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is imprisoned again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was detained Tuesday at a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscle strength in the legs, his personal physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer in the language which has been operated four times and stays under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is your personal doctor, told Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplasic diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his view Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, wished him not him because he knows innocent.
It operated four times the tongue cancer, has a weight loss weight of 18 kilos which you have teamed up other pathologies such as severe erosive gastritis, the cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, listed the doctor.
Fujimori met detention since September 2007 in the National Directorate of special operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people at the hands of a squad of annihilation of the army which operated clandestinely in the first years of his Government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official convoy, headed by the President of Uruguay, Jose Mujica, and composed of several Ministers and businessmen, will begin Tuesday a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between the two Nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, highest point in an extensive schedule of meetings with authorities political, commercial and an encounter with the collectivity of Uruguayans residing in Mexico, based on the schedule issued by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the Presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in all what are the political issues between the two Nations", according to published the Presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to achieve that Calderón will support Uruguay in the France incident emerged when the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community to those countries which continue to be tax havens, statement which caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation its Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico presides over the G20, a group composed of the strongest emerging and developed countries in the world, since November and has existing with the South American country, since January of this year, an agreement to Exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan Government has tried in recent years expedite the realization of tax exchange agreements in order to emerge from the "grey list" of the Organization for cooperation and the economic development (OECD), formed by countries that have not implemented all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
A Treaty of free trade (NAFTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations have existing since 2004 at the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay.
The moustached plumber passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tireless, over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but he had never before done in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which reaches the shops around the world, this month has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how it should work without glasses stereoscopy", said the head of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, press during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first game in Nintendo thought originally that support", because until now hits as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo spokesperson has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" game that allows you to enjoy a smooth and fast game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "easy" to engage in the less skilled users.
Once overcome, experts may give a "run-off" to levels of game, this time with greater difficulty.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of action, but will need to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "not succumbing to optical illusions".
This Super Mario foray into three dimensions also involves the return of the character to a handheld console, fact not seen since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes winks to the followers of the saga and repeated the formula of the success of the previous installments, consistent in that the plumber of the mustache will have to traverse platforms mined dangers with the aim of freeing the Princess Peach.
Although the player will encounter innovations in movements, settings, costumes and the enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom backs extradition of Portillo to United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that gave pending extradition of exgobernante Alfonso Portillo to respond in United States for conspiracy to laundering $70 million.
So ends the process so Guatemala responded to the request of the north country which called Portillo to try him there.
In press conference, Colom asserted that his decision is due to the independence of powers, judicial and Executive, taking into account that a court ruling had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his term "not got the hands" in judicial decisions and gave all extraditions that has known procedure.
In addition to Portillo, will be extradited Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada walls, both for drug trafficking.
Done by Colom is an Executive procedure then be exhausted all judicial and constitutional authorities to prosecute the exmandatario between 2000 and 2004.
According to resolutions of the fifth Criminal Court and of the constitutionality Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited one time has resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and ensuring their human rights.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzlement of Q120 million in the Ministry of defence when he was President, which was the process that putting the extradition, but the public prosecutor appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was created to avoid the fall in the marginality of guys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of the life of the entity of Trinijove social support is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation over the quarter of a century.
Added to this is the long hundred of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in a ceremony held in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats which was attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the District of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, unemployed, with problems of dogradicción or situation of marginality.
The celebration yesterday in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of Heads of organizations and institutions in these 25 years have collaborated with the Association.
The varied political representation, in full election time, showed the unitary nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the Socialist education, Ernest Maragall, exconseller and the exteniente of Mayor and current Councillor eco-Socialist Ricard Gomà.
Also went to the great Hall of the Fabra i Coats the current Minister of Social Welfare i Família, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the director-general of the obra social La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove was born at a very difficult time and that the current is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President put to Trinijove as an example as to fight against the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work done", he said.
Evicted farm okupada where did macrofiestas
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes 51
The 12 occupants left the farm yesterday noon without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare lived 51 of Balmes Street residents has reached its end.
Twelve people noon yesterday voluntarily left the building they occupied illegally, and where organized macrofiestas that desesperaban to the neighborhood, by court order and without police intervention.
When the operation ended, the bolt of the door was changed to avoid a repetition of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control", said the Manager.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited-, took all the wiring and part of the water, as well as painting the walls and leave waste of all kinds, especially of alcoholic beverage cans.
The first three floors were the scene of multitudinous celebrations, which lasted up to two days and desesperaban tenants.
Next to the building there is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been injured.
His owner, Maria Pantinat told Europa Press that since the building was occupied business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points the invaders of the estate made him unfair competition, that they sold the drinks to three euros, while in the disco are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local entertainment had to respond to neighborhood noise complaints, while, as noted, the inconvenience don't cause them customers from the nightclub, but the inhabitants of the House okupada and, above all, those attending festivals organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry residents of the area.
Responsible for the nightclub explained that the inconvenience were so large that even reached an agreement with the property owner and nine months ago that "sorry you" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that during the past few weeks he had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The President of the municipal group of the PP in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "remove immediately the property to eliminate the problems of coexistence and civility that produce the neighbours, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only had a busy floor of the building, but over the past months the squatters had been entering on all floors of the building and in almost all of the floors, and that some even have been robberies.
In this regard, he added that, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and be strong against the delinquence which has generated on the farm".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 1530 hours the police turned up to 35 of the street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people accessed the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the occasion of the call beyond polemics on fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
Were the 80, in full swing of the now defunct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed a few placards of promotion of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great Park of Metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, he accompanied a comparison in figures, with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the Park returned to raise, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, with the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the North-South axis but above (mountain) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola natural park is in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boars in the role of Yogi bear.
In these he was until that, in September, the City Council convened a megacompetición composed of 16 contests for other so many doors of access to Collserola.
A door refers to the idea of Park, no doubt.
Or that or someone seeks to put gates to the field.
The question leaves single: Collserola Park or mountain?
The contest, its purely organizational side both which is reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It is almost a recurring theme that dip when two members of this ancient breed of elected are recognized in an elevator.
And this fact gives, precisely, one of the few coincidences between what they think three Barcelona architects and university professors, that have been tabled.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayonne: the contest is appropriate.
For Roldan, after approached the coastal front "is necessary" discuss "front mountain", given that the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, of Green apples, has not carried out.
"It should be assumed that the largest park of Barcelona is the beach."
Among other things by its great accessibility.
"Collserola is more complex", sentence the architect for whom the title of "door of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": do not think them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where we must act".
Mòdol, such as Roldan and Bayonne with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal of "intellectual challenge" with "some risks".
Risks of the "uncertain that today is day project public space" after the experience of the 1980s and which was in the area of the Forum "his the swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of borders where you can build.
"Limiting something is already set the next step", i.e. his overweight.
"You have to think in new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters".
More tight question, Mòdol believes that you simplifying, the Collserola vallesana side "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not", a purely topographic point.
Mòdol reminds that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not fall on deaf ears", although it appreciated the opportunity afforded by the town hall to your Guild to intervene in this project "from the outset".
And further, understands that the proximity of the mountains with the city is the safe-conduct allowing architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" about whether this technical profile which must lead multidisciplinary teams ("a success", points) had to create: "architects should be just a tool".
Bayonne hinted that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because the contest is missing an overview of Collserola: "They have called 16 transverse contests - says - in the sense montaña-mar, but there is a longitudinal reading, see and understand the area as a whole".
This leads to, at least in his case, which has opted to participate in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can crash into program and definition with the architect of the door from the side.
In his view, that Yes, the Council should ensure that the immediately superior to the Ronda de Dalt Strip should provide, in its entirety, an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will be free
After 72 days of roots, the legal representative of the Casino network granted pardon to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey of the process followed by alleged blackmail
After 72 days remain prisoner, Larrazábal Jonás Manuel will be released once the legal representative of the Casino network granted forgiveness before the second criminal District Court, which follows a process by blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the bombing to Casino Royale, the owner of Casino network, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos that allegedly Manuel Jonah demanded an economic fee to allow the Monterrey City Hall to the clandestine operation of the House of bets.
After the public denunciation, the State Attorney-General opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the Mayor pan and on 2 September was arrested and rooted for 30 days.
After four hours before the 3 Public Ministry agent in property crimes, he was transferred to the House of roots 1, located in the old town of the capital of the State.
There it remained for 49 days to the dictár are you a second order of deeply rooted then that the agent of the public prosecutor's throw out the offences of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October he was transferred to the Cadereyta criminal allegedly by blackmail with a million and a half dollars to the owners of the Casino network; However, only he stayed a few hours in medium security prison that there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial admitted to the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25 he turned arrest warrant by the Secretary of the second criminal District Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of investigation checked enough evidence to determine the guilt of Jonah, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to representatives of the House of bets to change to allow the operation of the same.
Monday, the legal representative of Casino network, Victor Aldo García Gómez, went before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the regio Mayor; so in the next few hours could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the public prosecutor attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, he questioned Garcia Gomez if had repaired the damage and who members of the House of gambling was that granted pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the dossier 197/2011 grant legal forgiveness to Jonah Larrazábal and thereafter it may not present claim process followed; addition to repair of damage is not required nor punishment.
After the hearing to the legal representative of the House of bets, near the 15: 50 ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Breton.
The Secretary of court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonah who has legally been forgiven and your file will be closed.
It also shall order immediate release issued by the judge.
Pérez Jácome Dionisio Secretary gives details of the plane crash where the Interior Secretary, Francisco Blake, was killed and seven other people
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) reported results on the accident where the Interior Secretary, Francisco Blake Mora, was killed and seven people, indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, while the pilot could attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that before take-off the aircraft, the pilot confirmed that weather conditions were right to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the terrain, the blades had contact with trees 25 metres where the unit lost the fuselage".
It was also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had requirements to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that made investigations in the area of impact does not report the appearance of pieces on the ground.
"In a search are reported that there are no parts or components of the ship somewhere else, the impact was presented of structural form."
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, had appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the Secretary said that it is a priority to have the outcomes; However, the investigation can last for several months, it could even reach one year.
For its part, Gilberto López Meyer, CEO of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential General staff operated in cruise speed and that this happened in a bottom-up soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant element in the research:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation regulations flight was carried out under visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in Mexico were conditions to take off, as it progresses the aircraft towards the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico were layers of cloud cover at low altitude.
Selected routes:
Is likely to cloud the crew conditions has sought a lower elevation area and greater visibility into the Valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of impact and the last row of the aircraft's radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight path.
Dispersal of remnants of the aircraft in a small area:
The information available so far suggest that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and side.
The pattern of dispersal of remnants of the aircraft suggest that the helicopter crashed on the ground in terms of structural integrity.
Evidence of fire or explosion is not detected:
On the site of the incident remain undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the research indicate that it may have had multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work pieces of the aircraft at an elevation of 9,000 have been found 200 feet above the average level of the sea, the ground presents a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which predictably dismantled along this route.
The information provided elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have multiple impacts on the ground.
After the thorough search in a wider area than the lacing site around the accident, not found scattered pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to find obesity gene
Directs the Social Security an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people; is supported in the IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that he directs an investigation to discover the gene for obesity in children and young people, called Protocol 'Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which allow to have markers associated with being overweight.
In a statement, the head of the unit of medical research in biochemistry of specialties of the 21st century National Medical Center Hospital, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it was composed of a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team is supported by scholars and postgraduate students of the National Institute of public health (INSP) and the Center for research and advanced studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the research are invited to participate to the population whether or not a claimant attend sports participating units of the IMSS in the Mexico Valley, where carried out tests to children, every Saturday from 8: 00 pm.
He stressed that the Protocol began in the unit sports Cuauhtémoc (State of Mexico West) and that from October 8, the activity is carried out in the unit sports Nezahualcóyolt (State of Mexico East).
Once is complied with the aim of bringing together 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the sports unit independence (South of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos sports unit (to the North of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of the development of obesity genetics and identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
Celebrate it on November 14 the World Diabetes Day, he pointed out that the objective is to gather three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
You will also be asked about physical activity and heredofamiliares history of diseases, for the purpose of avoiding risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday they applies to all participants anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), takes blood pressure, determination of the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin and genetic (it seeks to identify genes involved in childhood obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this research reflects the concern of the health professionals by alarming weight gain in children.
' Health in 1999 and 2006 surveys indicated that in just six years, there was an increase, in the case of children, from 77 per cent in obesity, and 47 per cent girls; in terms of overweight also noted a dramatic rise ', stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He said the justification for the search of the markers is based on that of the country's population differs from others by their genetic history.
It was reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent of estate Indian American, 30 per cent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and excess weight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn excess energy we consume (calories) and that it is stored as fat.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral assessment of children, which can detect if they have some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even said, the presence of folds of dark color (Acanthosis) neck and forearm, indicating the probability that suffers from metabolic disturbances and even prediabetes.
Information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it by writing to the parents, who they explained each of the measurements and changes in lifestyle that should be done to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentary lifestyle, that is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high caloric intake, i.e., increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc) with a high content in fat and protein and genetics which is dealt with in this Protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry of the UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If signals that sends the pavement were met, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Nájera Herrera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (CF) of the UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is the appropriatepotholes could be reduced in amount or even eliminated altogether.
In his lecture A technological view of potholes, issued within the framework of the international year of chemistry, unveiled the laboratory responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to the asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both high and low temperatures.
Nájera Herrera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the North of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the formation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the heaviest part of the oil, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, a high molecular weight, called asphaltene and other low molecular weight, called maltenos, which together give the pavement their characteristic behavior memory foam.
Memory foam asphalt behaviour is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius the viscosity is very high and 50 degrees centigrade presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the road becomes brittle, it added.
This means that on the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but that will change during the day according to the environmental conditions and temperature, warned the specialist in chemical engineering.
CF researcher noted that the streets of the city of Mexico are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involving the asphalt.
Among the more superficial layers is the asphalt, composed of small stones bathed in asphalt and then packed.
Each of the pebbles which constitutes the folder, he noted, is bathed with asphalt.
Transit vehicles and generate efforts, this allows forces to be disseminated very well on pavement.
They would if it were modified asphalt be they disseminated even better, felt the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt, it added, is placed a last layer called folder of Raceway, which is made up of a fine stone material, i.e., an arena that also bathes in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of vehicles, must you have more mechanical strength than the asphalt and provide friction on the road.
To be part of the pavement will receive and impart the efforts, the Raceway folder, also requires, have the appropriate thickness and material of which it is made must be careful.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially the water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt.
When the ground is moistened, water spreads the folder inside and out, this causes a softening of all layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes is difficult.
In the process of formation of a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the film of bearing and only later affects the asphalt, but damage does not happen instantaneously, but it is a process that should attend the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
Also member of the national system of researchers explained that vehicular pollution is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each layer of the pavement must go always under vehicular load and ensure full compliance, to avoid potholes forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, that in other countries they are even in the market and allow to repair potholes with ease and without using high temperatures.
What you failed the candidate of the Valley to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to that Melina Ramirez Serna don't reach the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The Valley receives his number 14 of Princess title.
Again the Valle del Cauca is left with the desire of the Crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle with be on the winners podium, wearing the Crown of silver and the band that credited it as new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the Crown and sceptre, the Department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina is a legion of vallecaucanas women who have been close to the Crown but were declarations princesses including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979)Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Now the big question that many ask is what failed?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the police and Queens best face Vogue Jolie, titles which they obtained as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the Crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor which is considered key in the decision took the jury to appoint her first Princess is not convinced with his answer to the question "What is that book that you marked to you and why?" made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the literary Leamos cart.
The interrrogante the recently responded:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think that it is a form of culturalizarse, definitely think the book that marked me of childhood is"The little Prince", is a fairly deep book."
Now I read "Crime and punishment", is a book of literature that everyone must read; and today I'm reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The burning of the blood" "."
A response that little liked by the term "culturalizarse" and not explain second first concrete how every one of the books cited have marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina stated to feel calm and happy with the result "the universe is passes wise what needs to happen."
"And for all people, please read a little bit,"The little Prince"is a great book"
Between released scenarios is said to Valley her burned favouritism.
A journalist Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the ovacionada and the candidate carried all the preliminary Awards (challenge of gastronomy Oster, vote of the public for the best traditional costume, and Queen Mother), "that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, estresó to the Queen and why not shined on stage".
And it noted in its first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton and its two parades in the evening of Coronation.
Although both it looked secure, noted that he lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic Yes showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "As at home", of the RCN expressed the view that the fact that Melina was designated Princess "check that the candidate that most awards won during the contest remains as Queen".
In addition, Valley was last very elusive with the press, and there was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valley did not convince the jury on his interest in social work, which is at last, the essence of the national beauty contest.
Something, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty expressed that they were seeking a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, have to look at more than the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, who before entering the competition are already involved in projects", explained.
There is also speculation Valley sinned for its defects in the derriere and fibrosis that noticed you in your abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the body more healthy, good nutrition and responsible for physical work.
The coach of Queens Jorge Hernan Orozco recognizes that Melina was not the best body, which had better, "but your problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, the truth for me was very notorious, he came down points on the last day".
Meanwhile journalist Guido, of the stickers magazine finds that the error of the regional was surgical interventions which are practiced.
"Surgeries are fine, but Valley is them failed to do."
"His body was never strong and they here claimed."
For this prize, that for the first time gives the national beauty contest, after the parade in swimsuit emerged a cruel prophecy that last night was fulfilled, as it was said that this was the contentillo Raymundo granted to Melina for not giving him the pleasure of the Crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as Princess, position which gives you the possibility to represent Colombia at one of the international contests for designation of their own national competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its overwhelming passage by Cartagena, was elusive Crown.
This was the work of the caleño who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopista of Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officers is key.
On November 4 a lofoscopista of the CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the maximum Chief of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", through the comparison of their fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopistas working in the branch of the CTI, this week played "availability" question time Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada, who has 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation.
At the start of his career, Gonzalez worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where they were the bodies which should be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after conducting the relevant courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of skin friction, IE, palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano to Eliazar they warned him to take minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
The Friday night came out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
I knew that it should identify two corpses and that it suspected that one of them was the man heading the oldest guerrilla movement in the world, by what he asked him to take card decadactilar of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when she arrived with the research team to the site in which the corpse was not recognized by their physical appearance, as it was very different from who he had seen in the media.
It was without beard, dressed as a farmer in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtoniana, ink, a transplantador and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with the card.
His eye not failed him: was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a native man of Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm him to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, yes it was the maximum head of the Farc.
In search of the footprint
For a dactiloscopista of the Sijín of Cali recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González, at the press conference by the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
The dactiloscopistas is an exact science, no margin of error, which can be key in solving crimes.
Apart from the identification of corpses, the lofoscopistas support research for offences such as theft and homicide and confirmed the identity of the persons captured.
When they are caught, many criminals present false certificates or have no papers.
We take them the fingerprint printing and look for them in the database.
The investigator told that in a case of theft, fell it to remove a piece of wall of a House, because there the thief had supported his hand to get a safe deposit box full of jewels and money.
"Walls are difficult because they are not areas appropriate to get a fingerprint printing but then could obtain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also discard or reaffirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently found a dead man, with bottles of liquor to her around.
Through research, it was determined that a family member might be suspect of the crime and, indeed, a mark on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that it has been the killer, yes locates it at the scene of the crime.
A dactiloscopista of the CTI explained that in objects "fingerprints are drawn with chemical reagents or physicists".
When they appear, a transplantador is used or tape to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent Asif, which is the criminal database, or the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", said the expert of CTI.
He clarified that not everything is as shown in the CSI television show.
Just as not everything that glitters is gold, not everything that touches becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective matching is performed.
"Indignant" challenge to authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators are agolpaban before the plaza of Zuccotti camping.
A much attended the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the movement takes Wall Street defied Tuesday to New York authorities try to enter again, under the protection of a court order, to the plaza of Manhattan where they were evicted at dawn and trying to deal with another Park of the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators are agolpaban before the plaza of Zuccotti, where wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignant" return to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction occupying one Park North of the city, where there has been new arrests.
"Our idea is that, if the Court does not allow us to return to camp in the square, we're going to install somewhere else and will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokesmen for the movement "Is Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to evacuate their camp personally issued by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to courts where the judge Lucy Billings issued an order which prohibited the forced site evacuation and allowed the protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignant" proceeded to the occupation of a new park at the confluence of the Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, linking New York and New Jersey, and property of the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and proceeded to detain some of the protestors, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he told Efe that saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization ensures that are several hundred people which had been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already has shifted in show of support to the members of the movement and that he has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti square - which is an enclosure of private - property remains closed pending the holding of a court hearing scheduled for same on Tuesday in which must analyze the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some of the displaced protesters up there they carried and distributed copies of the court order to these hours and even them handing over to the officers who guarded the square, causing "some small clashes", said Bray, who claimed that some officers was beating the protesters.
Court order prohibits the authorities evict members of occupies Wall Street or apply "laws that were published after the start of the occupation or prohibit the demonstrators again accessing the park with shops or other properties using previously".
Mayor Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to this warrant, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to return to install with tents and sleeping bags.
Alderman personally defended the eviction carried out in the early morning of the plaza of Zuccotti, an operation in which proceeded to around 200 arrests and it was decided because the demonstrators were "breaking the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was making "in a place where the people came not to protest but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to do harm to others", and that "some businesses had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction of this morning was disgusting and demonstrates that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests that American workers at the bottom," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the Mayor of "disrespect to freedom of expression".
Responsible for "Occupies Wall Street" also indicated that they think organizing "great action" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months lasting protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be on a Christmas television special Mary
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, it will appear in "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" television show on 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the Assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", Bunny "Playboy", the wife of the musician Tommy Lee and now, actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private CTV television channel announced today that Anderson, along with the "crooner" (balladeer) Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, appears in the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV today released images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic home video that appears along with her then husband, "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, drummer appears dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a doll depicting Jesus in a manger.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as host in part of the tour "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, he appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and that is no stranger to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "Fox" to the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the spiral of declines that began in March
Since last March the Japanese economy was still convalescent, paralyzed by the devastating earthquake which became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that suffered Japanese abroad since World War II.
Early estimates of the Tokyo Government put the damage at $ 300 billion, a blow that, despite a difficult global context, appears to have been watered down.
After three consecutive quarters of falls between July and September gross domestic product data served to turn the page, definitely: GDP increased 1.5% in comparison with the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
The registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year starts in March 2012 - supposed, in addition, the increased pace of growth since the period from January to March 2010.
Recovery is explained, in part, by the rebound in the purchase of equipment to restore the areas ravaged by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditures noted from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real shock of the Japanese economy not is based exclusively on the Keynesian boost which invites you to take advantage of the crisis to reinforce - or rebuild - infrastructure, use gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan aroused, mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, fueled by increased spending in vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the"shelter" chosen by investors fleeing from the debt crisis in the euro zone and murky forecasts of EE.UU., a privilege which weighs as a slab in the accounts of the exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic flotation line is determined by the health of large technology groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed its weak results between July and September to the value of the yen.
While markets remain with their siege to peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda not lowers its guard.
"We must be alert to the risks that remain, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And, indeed, the prospects aren't encouraging.
The Organization for cooperation and economic development (OECD) said that the majority of Member States submitted in September clearer signs of economic slowdown.
The indicator which anticipates the inflection in the global economy points emphasized that the major powers are holding back.
That dropped four tenths up were 100.4 points, against the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone, even stood below the average, found on the 100 level to precipitate eight tenths up 99,13 points.
Athens again feed the doubts
Papadimos said that adopted adjustments, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral triggered risk premiums and the uncertainty reinstated in the parquet, Greece still entangled in the maze that leads towards the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new transitional Government hellene comes more imposed by the demands of Brussels by a genuine belief of political forces starting to confirm with facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for the structural reforms and the hundred days period agreed designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party new democracy, Antonis Samaras, ensured that it will not support new measures of austerity in any case and reiterated their demand for new elections to dateon 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement decisions of the Summit on October 26", asserted Papadimos yesterday opened a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new Executive.
A package with 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras not clears doubts about its stance: "we are committed to assist the Transitional Government, but we are not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader went one step further in your pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should unlock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needed, and made it clear that it will not its approval to any letter of commitment to implementation of the settings.
But the European Commission, escocida even by the impact caused by the referendum of Papandreou órdago, yesterday reiterated its demand is strong: not unlock aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main parties Hellenes do not sign "a compromise written without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman explained that the inspectors of the troika will return "soon" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "that is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, although there is no definite date.
The Greek Hank still has thread for a while.
Sofia: "Are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "mainstreaming" of Spain in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has attained a prominent place globally in the role of the microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become these past two decades in the second largest donor of the posed in relation to this instrument of cooperation, whose "essence" pointed out that he lives in a "tool for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind, based on trust in humans".
The Queen yesterday opened the V world Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "no doubt" that is kind of operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the Millennium development goals established by United Nations with Horizon 2015, and "especially in one that has as its goal the reduction by half of the volume of people whose income is less a daily dollar", with which sets the "poverty line".
Spain "still working" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with"responsibility", said Sofia, he hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating from the Summit, which runs until Thursday,"ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and in particular for women"", major beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "many achievements" and "many challenges that we face".
The Microcredit Summit arises not only as a forum for discussion, but also as the platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
Thus, his Majesty explained that it aspires to the millions of poor families who have agreed to these financial services and a hundred million of these households out of the poverty line in which they are mired are 175 by the end of 2015.
The momentum in the conception of the microloans in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path initiated way years ago pioneer" by Muhammad Yunus, highlight Sofia as an "Act of Justice and due recognition".
And he described the father of this tool as an "Idealist admirable in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work known 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to meet their lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later the first Summit in Washington and other meetings as celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada 2006, and "all I have seen continuous evolution", explained his Majesty, whose link with this project yesterday earned him the epithet of the "head of household" having in Valladolid by the "poor baquero".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by urging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic State.
In this regard, he explained that a mistake would be to link cooperation with developing countries to economic good times, it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered microcredit pose "a policy serious and rigorous dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and "more than ever" the Governments of developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let this victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretary of State for international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "success" to "trust" the people "excluded who all close the doors"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors involved the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Union (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without major difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Party.
Initially had not been included in the agenda of the future of Europe, but the topic imposed in autumn, in particular to meet the activists who believe that the Government's policy is currently too loose with the Greeks and it could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only there were nine votes against and 10 abstentions.
The standing ovation of several minutes that won, with their interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the Europhile Minister of finance, releasing any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and the motion, summarized in a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor "has come the time to lead the way in Europe".
This could manifest itself in the Lisbon Treaty changes to allow for strengthening the control of the European Union on the countries of the euro area fiscal policies, although it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the twenty-seven quickly reach an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the leaders of the CDU seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to assess the weight of each country of the directive of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which would clearly strengthen the weight of Germany.
Eager to calm down inside his party, the Chancellor increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is not that it has tried to win over its Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulties willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentado to France.
Except in passing.
Recalling that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud losses by disease
After subsidies, the UMP and Government undertake an offensive against losses due to illness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday November 15 in Bordeaux, to visit a responsible family allowances Fund and deliver a speech on the theme, already since 2007, the fight against social fraud and the assistantship.
In addition, to accompany such offensive, that part of the will save rigorously, but still resembles an axis of the presidential campaign of right-wing, a majority wants to focus on casualties due to illness.
First of all, to implement budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on workers of the private sector a fourth day of deficiency before to take down.
In short, unless there is a Convention of company specific, a worker who falls ill lose four days of salary, i.e., a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but that would make it possible to save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: impose officials a day of absence without pay in the case of sick leave (so far, have no lack, compared the three days that apply in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, most again put on the table equally the subject of fraud, this time oriented towards abuses of labour losses.
"Will significantly increase the controls and, in addition, if someone committing a fraud, he shall reimburse the amounts," warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem slightly disproportionate to the reality of the fraud in the field of industrial casualties.
In fact, since 2002 performs constant monitoring of this issue and various political offensive that, usually, have borne fruit have taken.
The French not sick than in the rest of Europe.
With attention, first of all, look at the national figures.
According to the French Institute of social security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros in benefits were paid by labour casualties.
According to the French Institute of research and documentation in health economics, subsidies for losses, in 2008, accounted for 5% of expenditure on health, rising to 11,300 million euros.
Of this amount, 46 per cent corresponds to casualties by maternity and accidents at work, while 54% is related to losses by disease, figure amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
Therefore, 2.5% of spending on health.
In 2010, the French have taken an average of 14.5 days of sick leave, to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
An average which, no doubt, hides deviations: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian of professional management in Monster.com, showed 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not caught a single day of baja sickness.
Another study, in this case the assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of casualties from disease had a duration less than 8 days, 22% aged between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% were longer.
When compared with our European neighbours, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to take casualties due to illness.
A long study in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence from work (both for health reasons and another type) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, compared to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands or United Kingdom.
Fraud losses due to illness is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud is quite limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation, since 2002, has led to make systematic controls of the casualties due to illness of more than 45 days.
In 2008, 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM, 13% of the made 285.000, were found to short-term losses "unjustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of losses of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, deemed that 11% of cases were "properly adapted or unjustified;" a figure, taking as starting a total of 1.2 million, amounting to 132,000.
Therefore, reached a total of 169,000 cases "unjustified" among millions of workers who took a sick leave.
Certainly a figure insignificant in comparison, for example, with the work in black.
According to the Member of the UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, the practice represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9,000 and 15,000 million euros a year, i.e. more than the total cost of the subsidies for casualties and, no doubt, considerably more than fraud in this last area.
Papadémos: Greece should implement a new plan of adjustment
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to fix its economy.
This is what stated on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos to the Parliament; He also added that the hundred days that have been given to his Government of Union would not suffice to achieve such objective.
"For efforts that will lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our partners in Europe and a new programme of budgetary adjustment," declared the head of Government, who pronounced his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Summit of the euro area on October 27 will be the "primary task" of the new Government, since "is at stake" the permanence of the country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Papadémos has provided that the country's public deficit will be reduced to around 9 %"" of GDP before end of year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejected new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right-wing group, showed Monday its support for the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit additional austerity measures.
"Do not vote for new measures", he said during a meeting with members of his party "New democracy".
He noted that he agreed with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and debt, and fight against waste, but against any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for economic and Monetary Affairs, which warned that the IMF and EU desbloquearían not need 8,000 million euros loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties for the measures envisaged, Antonio Samaras has responded that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A Committee of experts States that euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians living denying death, according to the report by the Royal Society of Canada
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives to deny death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians is willing to talk to your doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and take provisions to that effect.
It's one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Canada society, with the participation of six experts from various fields, including the ethical, legal and medical.
This Committee recommends that the Government to amend the criminal code so that allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, when the patient there is such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To start, experts cite a recent poll by the Economist Intelligence Unit, comparing the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada ranked tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid of dealing with death".
With medication or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And while the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them has just died in the hospital.
Altogether, the highest rate in this sense recorded the Québec, where 86% of deaths occur in the hospital.
In regard to the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reached conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal Government, which has already declared that you don't want to modify the criminal code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or suicide assisted with not competent persons or which had not given his consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said yesterday via teleconference that, on the contrary, observed more excesses in those countries where they have not legalized euthanasia or assisted suicide.
"In Canada euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal".
"Canada is practised in assisted suicide, although it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians favour euthanasia
Let us remember that 85% of Canadians already have spoken out in favour of euthanasia, as they believe that it would allow people whose death is next to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid in 2010.
In addition, 66% believed that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not to understand the life of elderly or disabled people to have less value.
With regard to persons who have practiced the assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believed should not initiate a process against them.
In connection with maintaining or interruption of healthcare to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, between its recommendations suggest stated in the criminal code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have rejected legally, is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of experts also requested that he train health professionals must respect the fact that a patient will reject assistance at the end of his life without fear to face a complaint.
In the field of palliative care, the Committee demands that Governments, health care institutions and physicians work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, on palliative or terminal sedation, already is widely used in Canada health institutions, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce the physical pain, is deemed to euthanasia and undergo the same procedures.
Other experts expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of the right to health have already expressed their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described as "extreme" position of the experts who sign the report, among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to patients in terminal stage.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and has more than 18 years can ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to give priority to the personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Well, now add "society, there in tags and limitations".
The specialist in law Margaret Somerville health also expressed its "strong opposition" with regard to the conclusions of the report, which described as "manifesto in favour of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Canada society, puts into question especially the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls to President El Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bachar El Assad expressed yesterday before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bachar El Assad that, with the support of Russia, her resists and alleged that there was a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria neighbors, had expressed support for the abandonment of power by President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the first Arab leader who urged President Bashar El Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where they have already died a quarantine of civilians and members of the forces of the regime.
"If Bashir really cares about his country, should resign, as well as creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life", said the King of Jordan, Syria neighbour, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, has regretted that mediation efforts that takes making Turkey from the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in failure.
"Those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can not satisfy them, depart", said alluding to Syria, neighbouring country with respect to which Turkey is taking an increasingly tougher stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States have taken place that it has "strengthened the consensus against Asad and the actions of the regime" Sirius.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries as Turkey, are taking a more hawkish tone" with regard to repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, they have already lost life 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the forces of the regime in the region of Deraa, in the South of Syria, as announced by the Syrian Observatory for human rights (OSDH).
Other two civilians have died "during bombing and shootings" with machine guns heavy in Khobar in the besieged city of Homs, as indicated by such NGOs.
During a press conference, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid to the Mualem, considered for its part that the country "is moving towards the end of the crisis".
It has also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend to Damascus of its functions, which in his opinion constitutes "a dangerous path".
Syria "not flaqueará", he added, ensuring that "the plots tramados against Syria fail".
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism of protection of civilians" and want to send 500 troops from Arab organizations of human rights, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, has also expressed its support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians against the repression of the regime which, in his opinion, is locked in the "paranoia".
Scheduled to celebrate a new extraordinary meeting of the League tomorrow in Rabat to finalise the implementation of the exit from the crisis plan adopted on November 2 which provides for, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces of the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, has tried yesterday as "incorrect" the decision by the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the plan of the crisis, although it was not manifested its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requests time to markets and sacrifices Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested some time to markets to form his team and launch a programme which will include "sacrifices" to regain the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday and today met with trade unions and employers.
It should be a relatively restricted Cabinet made up of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a comprehensive programme with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the abundant small groups who participated in the meetings, after having met with the appointed President of the Council.
For its part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, said that he hoped that Mario Monti solicited before Friday a vote of confidence from Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
Consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti, of a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, the head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti has said the nervousness of stock markets and bond holders yesterday, asking for time.
In the "democracy, there are precise deadlines" to form a Government and to prepare its agenda, stressed, adding that he was "sure that markets will have patience and will understand you".
His appointment by the President initially obtained the blessing of the markets, but later became the concern, in particular after an unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "political".
The new Government shall operate until 2013, the date of the next legislative, considers.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will get the vote of confidence from the Parliament before Friday.
Monti is committed to work when he is in Office, taking into account the urgency, with the aim for Italy "recover its role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn has stressed that "even with a new Government, will not vary our diagnosis of the Italian economy".
EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of achieving a balanced budget by 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted during the past months, has called for new measures of austerity.
"Boss of bosses" Italians Emma Marcegaglia, which will be the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "as a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements of deficit".
Monti, famous for its competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time shift" to Italy after 17 years of "berlusconismo"; the "Professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid an early election, Italy has to place about 200 billion euros in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in the development of a detonator which can be used with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO specialized in Atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute of science and international security (ISIS) it is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA said last week its "grave concern" for a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS, based extensively on the IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear Centre in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamond by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, would have left the Center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamantes" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to get in touch, in 1995, with the Embassy of Iran in Ukraine.
Later, it is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a system of nuclear detonation "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only was well acquainted with the technique, but who also, as reported by a Member State to the Agency, worked during most of his career in such technology in the nuclear program military in their country of origin".
Crimes and offences against Muslims have increased 50 %
Crimes and offences against Muslims increased nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, as indicated by statistics published by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims has grown from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e., increased by 49 per cent, against a rise of 13 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in the number of crimes and offences anti-religion.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly to 6.628 cases, of which a 47.3% is due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, worrying that they have increased again this type of crimes and offences", highlighted the Organization of human rights Human Rights First, the increase in acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant, added the organization in a statement.
"Human Rights First takes long time noting that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds a head of the Organization, Paul Legendre.
"The US Government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses," it adds, considering that such efforts could include an improvement in the reports of the police on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law inherited from the time of the struggle for civil rights.
Such legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin colour, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and is closer to Facebook
Microblogging Twitter website changed on Monday the presentation of its platform to enable its users, in particular, observe the activity of people that follow, which causes your service looks like a little more to the Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another one called "name" allow continue more frontlets and live activity of other "Twittos", i.e., those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follows on the Internet or that follow you.
This lets you know if dan follow-up messages, if they paid to new accounts, if they qualify for favorite messages, etc.
This new formula of Twitter proved "with a small percentage of users" in August before disseminating it to the rest of the network on Monday, as the spokesperson for Twitter, Carolyn Penner has indicated to AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive operation with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message to another person, stalk pour suivre recommander un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s' ainsi to a public plus large avec s'ouvre a comparable to celui plus maniement des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google +.
The network, users have been discussed "tweets" coup with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, it is invasive and seems too close to Facebook", writes @ jemb123.
"The function activity I will help to better follow my Twitter workflow elements", writes @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget in the Constitution
The great coalition Government social democratic/Christian Democrat who is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday include in the Constitution a "golden rule" budget to reduce the public deficit and avoiding a possible degradation of the sovereign Austria Note by credit rating agencies (triple to).
It was the own social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6 per cent, a figure much higher than the ceiling of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly inferior to the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If reduce the solvency of Austria in a single level, from AAA to AA +, would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest every year", noted Democrat viceminister for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria responds well to a request from the Brussels Summit countries members of the eurozone on 26 October: in it, the heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, by the end of 2012, the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is approaching the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year by 0.75 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal State should not exceed every year 0.35% of GDP, while the regional States, as well as the communes, should submit balanced budgets.
The goal is that by 2020 / 2021, public debt should be reduced under the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens renewed intervention in the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday would that Japanese authorities intervene again marking the change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervene, as did it the last time, if we see that it produces an excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen amounted to reach levels close to the highs that produced the intervention by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the American currency.
But the yen has gradually gone back since then, driven by purchases from investors who consider him "worth refuge" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar once again quote on Tuesday less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to those who provoked the last speech.
The dollar was trading before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, was at around 120 yen, and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency hurts exports of the archipelago, because it makes the products Made in Japan and reduces the value of revenue earned abroad by Japanese companies when they make it to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild it" after the earthquake and tsunami of March 11, they devastated the Tohoku (northeast) region, stressed Noda, who fear that the cost of the yen cut root the weak recovery.
The third world economic power has regained growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent over the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of the yen did not reflect the "economic foundations of Japan".
The Minister of finance, Jun Azumi, has called on the Bank of Japan (boxwood), which opened on Tuesday a two day meeting of its Council of monetary policy, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Deputy Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "adequate measures", implying that you should not expect more monetary flexibility Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the Institute of emission increased by five trillion yen (47 billion euros) purchases of Treasury bills, leading to the 55 billion yen (519.000 million euros) the threshold of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial titles to flood the market liquidity.
In the euro area:
rates grow, the stock markets falter
The risk of spread of the debt crisis still affecting European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of Government in Greece and Italy, as well as best figures of growth in France and Germany, the types of the most weakened countries continue to grow.
Still concerned about the stability of the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little more in the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and is situated 3.064 points.
The Dax lost in Frankfurt 0.4 per cent and London by 0.1%.
"Taking into account the new tensions in relation to the returns on loans in the euro area States most affected, stock markets around the world are still paying part of their recent profits".
"Nervous investors are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion," explains Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent, renewing concerns of the auditors of the market in relation to Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, have their eyes firmly on Europe and exchanges will be continued in a reduced margin of variations, so that investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized," considers Mitsushige Akino, Manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management funds.
The reappearance of the concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest for a month and a half.
To 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, a fall of 0.4 per cent.
According to traders, has lost value after the Party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, the CDU, which met Monday at the Congress, adopted a motion which provides for, in particular, the option that a country in difficulty leaving the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6 %
Credit Italy and Spain rates remain very worrisome levels.
On Tuesday morning, Italian obligations 10 years performance amounted to 6.85%, while the Spanish titles at the same time offered a 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to rates of interest of the countries of the South, also of France, are still fueling the fears of the external auditors.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time to markets to improve the situation in Italy, which runs the risk of choking off the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, meanwhile said that the implementation of decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the "principal work" of his Government.
Spain is in the crosshairs of the markets, while on Sunday there will be legislative elections.
The difference between obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain types ("spread"), has reached a new record high.
Waiting for the figures for growth of the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France has registered a growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e., a figure more favorable than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stalemate.
In addition, the fourth quarter is which really worries economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
It provided the first forecasts for the euro area as a whole at 11 a.m., once the European Commission has warned of the risk of renewed recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must assert more than dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be treated taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and the cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is right that an electoral encounter is time to reflect on these issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the set of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must be based his opinion on objective facts, in rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographics will be duplication of electricity before 2050 demand, unless a huge share of the world's population are deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, will have to address the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not modify any of these parameters.
Why, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case or Belgium, submitted his to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, Switzerland, which only aims build generation plants.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to cite some examples, are proceeding with determination with their projects.
The United States, by his side, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its Park, returning to the construction of a central interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, occurs occasionally as an example, the reality goes against such speech.
The choice of Berlin will be a rising electricity prices, increased energy dependency by the increased need for imported gas, in particular of Russia, an increase of CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, notice the harmful effects.
You must meditate on the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, which gets 30% of its electricity, is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the flashing of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are, respectively, a 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the perseverance of our energy policy, our neighbors paid a 40% higher than the French household electricity bill.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of energy is a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of the industrial utility in the national territory, French businesses benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would be a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which erode realism to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
It's a price that the vast majority of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, not express opposition in principle to this type of energy, as polls show.
Let us remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 jobs director and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Largely export-oriented, it includes a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and that can create jobs not relocatable.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of these SMEs and the loss of 6 billion euros per year in French exports of equipment and nuclear services.
What an electrician would be an EPR designed to work sixty years, when the collapse of its manufacturer is expected?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, it must be admitted that there is no miracle of electricity production source, as there is a diabolical source.
The development by Areva of solutions with low emissions of CO2, nuclear and renewable, demonstrates the complementary character of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of security.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises a strict and transparent control on the construction of Flamanville both existing power stations.
Our teams of acknowledged professionalism, are also obsessed by security.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one of Three Mile Island, occurred in normal operating conditions; not caused consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some unforgivable human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of a scope unprecedented, that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did in the previous two.
Thanks to these developments and cooperation between security authorities and operators and French and German builders, the EPR presents a design capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While studied it all electric stakeholders who wish to build a power station, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since would leave them via free to assume leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let that emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvering dominasen such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation in our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The politics of immigration applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed "country of human rights" of France status.
More recently, is administrative harassment of foreign students which has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of Interior (see the newspaper Libération on May 23) proclaiming of past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The issue is that, on this subject, there is enough consensus between left and right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set guidance stating in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country which has nearly two million migrant workers", while on the left, the tone set what Michel Rocard, explaining that France "cannot be responsible for all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and right shared fear of invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden for French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that act with respect to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include platitudes, indicating that co-development will allow to solve the "problem of migration".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps profitable electorally, but get economically very expensive.
As point Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron economists in a recent work that summarizes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will defines Our Future, may 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among scholars about the positive impact of migration on economic growthwages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
The limitation of immigration growth weakens and is detrimental to employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that these can be substituted for domestic workers, in particular to low-skilled, pressing to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are rather complementary than substitutes for national workers and mainly exercising professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and more skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand.
A positive effect on wages
In the same way that a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country having lack of anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants leads to the arrival of the latter to influence positively on wages and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migrant flows is a rise in real wages in the long term a 0.6-0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that diversity that bring immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel Prize winners and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants also are net contributors to social systems, since they provide from about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization estimated that in Germany an immigrant arriving at an age of 30 years will make a net contribution (revenue less expenses) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average during their lifetime.
At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go to find the points of growth that lacked "with teeth".
These teeth, dissuaded immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, need you just to think in a European democracy
Democracy is a precious, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this since, although he invented in Athens for more than two thousand years, the 20th century has suffered the tragedies of world war, totalitarianism, the Holocaust and the gulag, but also to Franco in Spain to Portugal Salazar, the colonels in Greece.
Some perhaps believed that democracy flourished definitely on their enemies, would enough to vote and the most direct way possible.
We know, from Napoleón "little", that it was something designed.
Universal suffrage, but it is a necessary condition for democracy, not only is sufficient in itself and even can become a "tool of oppression", as formerly said the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control powers, an education, lights, solidarity, economic and social justice.
The crisis in Europe is an economic crisis, but is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The verdadero-falso Greek referendum Palinode effect, in this regard, double revealing: showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying sense of impossibility, of his inconsistency.
You must reflect on this ambivalence to bridged.
The truth is that the front of the democratic battle lines have now moved and that, in many cases, the Republican soldiers already not move in the right direction.
We leave not winning if we demand a succession of national referendums organised in function of the needs and disorderly way.
A signature white the absolute European monarch or a high vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we don't want to get shock effect, but a common exercise of full right, quiet and continuous, of choices and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (would in fact not know where end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is which folds to the orders of the markets and the rating agencies, that he suffers from his impotence and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is which suffers humiliation in the international arena.
We worry about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but is all over Europe which slowly lost sovereignty and, with it, each of their Nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduced the weight of its debts, free markets and prepare for their future through investment.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level to not be taken without democratic legitimacy total, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having struggled for a long time against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, worldwide currently calls for a European economic governance.
So.
But think therein without further political and democratic integration, and be experienced as such by the citizens, it would be a new madness and would lead us to a new stalemate.
We must assume a new phase of European construction.
To build the France Republic, it was necessary to "do" Republicans.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a Europe more integrated from the economic point of view.
You can only be building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us Europeans.
Cards with chip "contactless" generalize
The world of chip cards trade fair starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, close to Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should finalize with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of cards with microprocessor (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to estimates by the Eurosmart Cabinet.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows to pay transport in common or purchases simply bringing the card to a reader.
Will this year be sold worldwide 460 million cards with contactless chip, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue in 2012 (is provided for 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market for cards with chip (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long behind on the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the sector of contactless payment.
Around 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, its beginnings are modest: 400,000 Visa Contactless cards are being used.
But supermarkets are working for four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard card.
To put the upper March, however, it is necessary that banks implement available to its customers.
"There are two big French establishments committed themselves to disseminate systematically in the future, among its clients, bank cards equipped with contactless system," Announces Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks tested the payment by mobile phone
But only constitutes a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, indispensable for the transactions.
"They are stuck".
"But it should finally experiencing a real boom next year."
"We expect that they will be sold between 80 and 120 million units in 2012 worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But banks take the lead.
The Bank Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
Equipped the iPhone around 200 clients and partners with a cover that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also said yesterday that it is preparing the commercialisation of an offer allowing customers to pay without contact via your mobile.
The Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram, which suspected for some time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even argued that Algiers already "has certainty".
"The way in which both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that they are cooperating," said, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have resumed the catwalks.
Abducted at a restaurant in Niamey by people associated with Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were killed the next day along with several of his captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, Nigerian and French researchers found several phone chip belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made pointing several partners based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in Northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man that is supposedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's progress, but certainly we should expect to have more formal tests before you speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"We know from years ago that the sect enjoys foreign financial and intellectual support and that is increasingly more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
These past months, those "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or in their operating modes, which now involve the use of kamikaze or more complex explosive devices with the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, is since then pressuring Abuja to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time considering the group as a community of enlightened little worthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri on a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
This poor region, the Association is experiencing a rapid success.
It politicized and requires a strict Sharia compliance, while their militants are released to the fight against the impious central Government.
The latter are aimed firstly at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and multiplied attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abuja was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and there were 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives the death in prison.
Since then, the sect was radicalizing and abandoned their strongholds of the North.
The past Christmas, claimed an attack that causes 80 killed in Jos, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram returned to attack against Abuja, in particular against the protected with a suicide attack, the police headquarters, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes his first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist shaft in Africa, covering from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is concerned about all the security specialists.
While that Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and Al - Chebab Somalis operating in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the Centre of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé has warned him against Boko Haram and has stated that he was willing to "share information".
The world according to Republican candidates for the Presidency
Compared with China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
An America weakened by the crisis, can manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplistic?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that it is.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates increasingly make more loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Extend the slogans, often infundamentados, China, Iran, Israel help.
Mitt Romney, the candidate better situated in the race to the nomination by the "Grand Old Party, has threatened to bring the Chinese to the WTO and Sue"by manipulating its currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
No matter if that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that has a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost drowns an attitude that "overwhelms" emotions.
He has asked a firm, but constructive, dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, which remains mired in the depths of the polls, is still inaudible.
Reagan-style
Romney has also promised an intervention military in Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I leave elected, stop Iran," fanfarroneó.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed its obligations in connection with that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second candidate ranked, for its part shows a shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, called to counter Chinese military threat because Beijing "seeks to develop nuclear capacity", apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the atom military since 1964.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, for its part, is prepared to deploy the army in Mexico in the fight against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, it also advocate Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
There are considerable differences with 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that won the cold war.
Remember that the own Obama was an amateur and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They insist, rightly, the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the hasty departure of the "boys" of Iraq and their misrepresentations in Libya, and often labeled it weak.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population judged the balance of national security Obama, which ended with Bin Laden in a rather positive way.
From Iraq, he become weary of military interventions that generate a collapse.
And arguing that you we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
Nord Stream, new gateway of the Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects directly Western Europe with Russia passing through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been in service.
You must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated on the shores of the Baltic, between the music of the Orchestra and a delicate buffet, at the opening of Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline linking directly, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister François Fillon French and his counterpart of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas in Western Europe network have revolved together.
With this new pipeline, each year reach 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas additional Western Europe through a first had of 1,224 km that connect the region of St. Petersburg with the Land of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded by the end of 2012 which allow you to supply a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, i.e., sufficient to cover all French consumption.
In addition, talk is of the possibility of constructing a third tube by the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion time of this huge work presents victory aires.
Poland and the Baltic countries had been strongly opposed to the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the Earth course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lost some of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia threatening to close access to the markets of Western Europe.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had no hesitation in comparing Nord Stream as a "new compact German-Soviet", referring to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin to deal with Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of the energy Europe, given that the project has created a gap between the East and the West Europeans.
Russia has, in just five years, do succeed his vision of a direct partnership between Russia and Western countries rich, large consumers of gas and with more limited reserves.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the pipeline, showing to what extent large contracts for the gas sector are as political as economic.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the directors of Gazprom, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The undersea tube is made of steel covered with cement to protect against the anchors of vessels.
It relies on the bottom of the sea, to an average of 200 m of depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating from World War II.
"It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to intensify the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long snake of metal which weighs as 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted in its entire length: valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control in the waters of Sweden platform was planned, but those responsible for the project renounced it to see that the Swedes were not very willing to allow that a society State Russian be established permanently in the sea off its coast.
"In the event of breakdown, means the passage of gas in less than a minute", accurate Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, gas from the pipeline be released, therefore, into the atmosphere.
But builders consider it unlikely that produce an escape, because they have provided for joints which, according to forecasts, will have a flight every 100,000 years.
The State of the pipeline control is guaranteed through a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which conducts field inspections, as well as a device that circulates through the interior of the pipeline.
Shaped like a cigar, it enters the interior of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to work for 50 years without any kind of repair.
The movement of the gas is guaranteed just by pressure.
At the beginning is of 200 bars and out of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
She joined the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in German, Switzerland, where enforcement is especially favourable.
Later, Gazprom leased to the society, for a renewable period of twenty-five years, all of the capabilities of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay by the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported", accurate Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline has been just 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that will not exceed your investment, because Gazprom assumes only the risk of costs alone.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted pines.
A few valves, with 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit door.
There are a few sensors that measure pressure, temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before that you transfer to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
Total capacity, shall be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people taste by writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is recognized easily, with their black rectangular pasta, rubber, their white broken, as ageing by the time sheets.
However, the Moleskine notebooks with the current aspect... born in 1997.
The Italian company mode mode, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant of the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book was inspired by an ancient technique of production, the mole (Mole skin) skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the sidewalks.
This kind of book was very appreciated by the writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has been adapted to current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," has Maria Sebregondi, which since then became responsible for the brand in mode mode.
And it achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far has been confidential production from the early years, in which 3,000 books only were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, the notebook attracts both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, which consisted of twelve workers in its early days, now has nearly 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and one in New York.
Distributes their books in libraries, from Fnac until the small shops in the center of the cities, and it has been able to impose its identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of the mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exposed his own notebook.
In August, it also released a notebook with tapas of Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.
Building on its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, pens, computer covers... The brand covers a wide range of media.
A success that provokes envy: in autumn of 2006, mode mode was acquired by the investment SG Capital Europe Fund, currently Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Is the unemployment rate of disabled workers why still so high?
About 19% of persons with disabilities, they are looking for a job.
15Th week for the employment of disabled persons begins today.
Despite a public policy resolved, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled twice the average rate: 19%, compared with 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disappointing?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, director-general of Adapt, the Association which organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
"Progress for fifteen years are substantial."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average."
"However, there is still a lot to do".
It is worth mentioning that the disabled unemployed still face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to have a more advanced age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% is not finished high school and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
I.e., there are numerous issues hindering the return to the world of work especially and which "constitute the crux of the problem", says Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies to hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; the mindset of the people is moving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS – Entreprendre for la Cité Association indicated that surveyed managers have "a level of knowledge about disabilities low", with an "over-representation of persons" in wheelchair, poor physical or intellectuals.
The result: companies with more than 20 workers are a far cry from the objective of hiring a 6% of disabled workers, objective that was set in a law of... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, reaching a ratio of 2.6%.
"Now reached about 3 %", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The proof: the number of "subject to this contribution" establishment, as well as the margin amounts have declined between 2007 and 2011, passing 59.000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which increased contributions, has generated pressure for companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, in particular among large groups.
According to the Ministry of labour, only 59% of companies possessing between 20 and 49 employees has disabled employees in its workforce, compared to 82% of companies between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday evening (20 h 45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens don't hide the pleasure that generates them this friendly match.
We dare not say that collusion among them noticed, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting one next to the other, at the podium of the Auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard really have made peace.
Five months after the gesture of bitterness of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach had only praise for him.
"I was much delighted by Eden, by their progress and because it is Belgian".
"I want to move forward," he tells Lille striker.
As for the contrast between their presentations on your computer and in the selection, "is a set", it has been justified.
"In Lille, I am throughout the year, which does not apply to Belgium."
"I have to be me".
Summoned to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "shine".
Without forgetting the "pleasure".
Has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been your fan," he says.
Without doubt, it will especially strengthen the "special" nature of the meeting.
Especially because it will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)", recalls.
"We just face recently."
"Always play against them is a joy."
With simplicity, Leekens has made reference to the "pride" for its part.
"Pride" by "A gala match".
"Pride" by check as a "neighbor", that France "again be a very high-level team", about a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has done a tremendous job," he said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technician would be delighted to share aircraft with the Bleus towards... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our Belgian children are growing," he stressed.
"We are building something;" the players are ambitious, hungry.
"You can see it in the next matches." Including the match against France.
Portugal shows confidence
The Portugal of Paulo Bento is facing the return game against Bosnia (22 h 00), to be held on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the match of round, lacked realism to both teams.
"When within these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento as seen in Poland and Ukraine.
It has no doubt; the Selecçao, which runs from September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Indeed, just 90 minutes separate Portugal of happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, that defeat.
Taking into account the Party of ida (0-0), the hell of Zenica Friday, it seems clear that the thing was not determined.
Portugal dominated the party for more than one hour, Yes, but could not dial the valuable goal that would have given him tranquility.
"This is a good result, but at the same time it carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home."
But at home, in the bright light Stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that will pass, before an audience that should be equally excited, even if it is clear that the party "is tight," dixit a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We hope that the game is tight, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead," said the Portuguese coach of 42 years.
"Still have 50% of opportunities to participate in the Euro 2012", has, however, relativized the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to mark and to win.
The Bosnians they could become a tie, although they also need to mark.
"This is a good result, but at the same time carries a risk, since we have not scored away from home," he regretted Bento.
"We are going to play against a team that possesses a high technical quality and provides players with a high quality individual," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the outset, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not allow them time to think".
A good idea, always that, this time, is realistic.
