A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama 
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policies with the need to fight the electoral fraud. 
However, the Brennan Center, the latter is a myth, by reiterating that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning. 
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States, in fact, only 300 cases of electoral fraud. 
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. 
In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States. 
In contrast with Canada, the US states for the conduct of the elections in the Member States responsible. 
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced new laws, the procedure for the registration or ballot boxes. 
This phenomenon after the elections in November 2010 has gained in importance, where 675 new Republican representatives could be recorded in 26 states. 
As a result, 180 draft laws were introduced only in 2011, which restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states. 
The new electoral laws require that the voters a card and a proof of the US civil schaft. 
In addition, these laws also shorten the period of the early voting, the law declared invalid, on election day to register as voters and citizens denied the electoral law, for which a court acts. 
Before the elections of 2006, no US state of the electorate required to produce a card. 
Indiana was the first state of such a requirement. 
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law. 
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states. 
In the course of the last two years, they drove in 34 states, with which the voters are forced to produce a card. 
It is important to note that US citizens, in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card. 
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible people not by a governmental authority of their state card. 
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card. 
However, there are often more than a hundred dollars to pay, in order to obtain the necessary ID card. 
Among the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected. 
In fact, 25% of an African American, 15% of people with an income of less than 35 000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary card. 
This goes further. 
The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their votes for Democratic candidates, it is not permitted in several states, their card issued by the body to use. 
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs, which elect more on the Republican side, the tickets issued by these clubs to use for elections. 
Before 2004, not a federal state for the electorate called for proof of citizenship. 
Arizona was the first federal state, which instituted a similar requirement. 
In 2011, a dozen states have laws passed by the voters demand that they prove their US citizen schaft. 
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote. 
It is clear that two of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party. 
In addition, Republican legislators have 2011 laws promoted in eight states, with which the registration of voters on election day has been abolished. 
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who want to register. 
These restrictions are not without consequences. 
For example, the campaigns for voter registration in the general elections in 2004 helped to register some 10 million citizens. 
Since 2009 adopted measures, the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared with 2006. 
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states pass laws, which aim to shorten the period for the early vote. 
For example, in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, an African American, even though they only account for 13% of voters in the federal state. 
The same is true of the Hispanic population. 
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance. 
In contrast, whites, which represented 76% of voters, only 46% of voters, who voted in advance. 
Of course, the Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of the electorate. 
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors. 
The Attorney General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial legislation. 
They were able to partially limit the damage. 
For example, only 16 of the 34 states pass laws that require the colleagues of a card. 
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will undoubtedly complicate the exercise of electoral law. 
The Democratic critics point the finger at the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear aim to influence the results in the 2012 key states. 
A report by the Brennan Center for 2011 shows that those states which have passed these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college are needed to win the presidency. 
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the legislation on the electoral system has a considerable impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012. 
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on the turnout. 
In this sense, undermine these measures, in part, the democratic system of the United States. 
Prostate cancer screening: the test should be done or not? 
The PSA-Test, in fact, sometimes faulty results in false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions. 
This leads to greater reluctance of the already unentschlossenen men for the implementation of screening tests. 
Should the test be done or not? 
We have obtained the opinion of two doctors. 
In the studies conducted in the United States there were a number of disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations. 
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without screening. 
This study has also shown that observation after 12 years, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out. 
This is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives who had been ill with prostate cancer. 
Afro-amerikanischer origin is also a higher risk. 
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been identified. 
There are some types of cancer, aggressive and others who are indolent. 
According to the patient, the extent of the risk of cancer is really being made clear by the possible options in which prostate crab can remain untouched, if it does not affect the life long term, and in these cases rather opt for an active surveillance of the disease. 
Today, for many men, in which cancer has identified no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives. 
It proposes an active monitoring and offers them in advance of the disease to a treatment. 
With increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not. 
This is why I recommend, however, that the implementation of the test. 
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor, in order to determine whether he should be executed or not. 
In cooperation with the International Society for Urologie Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible that the pros and cons of the PSA-Tests.

Prevention of disease 
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for the prevention of cancer. 
In spite of the advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it. 
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone eating well and would get enough. 
"If there were no smokers, this figure would rise at least to 50%," said André Beaulieu, we have buildings spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society. 
However, it is estimated that around 10% of cancers are caused by heredity. 
Several remain completely unresolved. 
As for the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers. 
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer. 
It is also a risk factor for many other types of cancer. 
It greatly harms the health of the people. 
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," lamented the spokesman André Beaulieu. 
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduced the risk of cancer death by half. 
The weight 
According to the Canadian Cancer Society promote obesity and obesity as well as the outbreak of the disease. 
They seem the risk for breast, grimm appendix, appendix, table Bauchspeicheldrüsen and cervical cancer. 
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout the entire life protects against grimm colorectal cancer," he adds. 
The diet 
The organisation also recommends to limit the consumption of red meat. 
In large quantities, it increases the risk of a Grimm or colorectal cancer. 
Sausages should also be shunned. 
The preservation of meat by Räuchern, dry or Salzen can lead to the formation of carcinogens. 
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says. 
Vitamins 
In recent years, several scientists have the link between vitamin supplements and cancer study. 
Their studies are currently not conclusive. 
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory. 
While a study reducing the risk of prostate cancer has been found, showed a different rather than an increase. 
The effect of vitamin D on cancer also has not yet been made quite clear. 
In addition, said Mr. Beaulieu, we have buildings just how important it is, with his doctor about his concerns and his family long-term. 
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer." 
The Higgs-Boson analysis 
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer, a certain sensation, and for good reason. 
In fact, that this Boson believes in nothing less than the mechanism for the mass of all objects in the universe is responsible. 
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence from the standard model - our best, or "least bad" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter, predicted, but has not yet been empirically observed. 
But for physicists, it is still not entirely sure that it is really about the Higgs. 
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that the Higgs-Boson predicted by the standard model is strong. 
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data this week have been presented at a major Congress in Kyoto, but there are still no data to be completely safe. 
Nevertheless, let us suppose that it really is the Higgs, there seems to be only a small risk to deceive themselves, and we are looking at what is at stake. 
There is a necessarily inevitable law in this world, which means that two objects are not at the same time in the same place. 
It is not possible to violate this rule - and you do not try to strong, because you will be hurt. 
After all, even if the particle physics is a truly strange world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" and the "status quo" by and large, consists of some of their properties. 
On that basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories. 
In a corner, the good citizens, who are referred to as Fermione and the pauli principle. 
And in the other Bosonen, a sinister gang of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred - at least not this principle, which means that they are in fact at the same time in the same place. 
This Bosonen structure, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not deal with here, and the "particles" through which the great forces of nature and it would be somehow related to the Higgs-Boson. 
It must be stressed, however, that these Bosonen are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think. 
If you have the ability to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the Photon or the "light particle," the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force. 
If a particle with an electric cargo or change the direction, the electromagnetic field is in this place "disrupted" like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond. 
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a Photon and thus one of the Bosonen "winner of the force." 
Stable business field 
The same is true of the Higgs-Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs-Feld, must be "disrupted" so that this Boson shows. 
However, the Higgs-Feld is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the virus must achieve very high energy, a little comparable with a frozen pond, the surface of a very large rock could be zerfurcht. 
That is why it is a huge particle flurry as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a volume of 27 kilometers! - in order to achieve such energies. 
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is once again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass. 
There are, in fact, not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field. 
Some people, such as the magnets used to do this, but others are not, for example, a piece of paper would never even in the refrigerator. 
And it also does not interact all particles with the Higgs-Feld: those who do have a mass, while others (like the Photon) have no mass. 
What all this research can now "be good," asks Mrs Plamondon? 
As for the science they serve the revision of the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM precisely to investigate. 
There are, in fact, many physicists who sincerely hope that these differences will be found, because the slightest difference a door open to a "new physics" and could fill some holes in the model. 
It must be said that the latter still have major shortcomings, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter provides around 80% of the subject matter of the universe (once again ups!). 
However, such deviations from the CERN has so far not been found. 
Impact 
The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there were no. 
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the bell labs are not believed that their work would trigger a similar revolution. 
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else. 
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the lasers were invented in the 1960s, and in 1962 the first permanent bar lasers (were the first gepulst) has developed - has already said that the lasers at the beginning rather than a "laboratory" has been considered. 
Imagine... 
In addition, applications may also arise from all the instruments which surround the research. 
For example, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969 during his work in the pulp with a small light sensor. 
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and gave him the Nobel Prize for physics. 
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you never really know... 
Palliative care - the best way to die.... | Le Devoir 
With its Committee on "dying in dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of life. 
The debate must shortly be resumed, although a bill is being prepared. 
However, it remains in this important area a lot more to be done. 
Le Devoir has tried to look into this. 
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie. 
The prostate cancer, which saw him aufzehrte, he had left a period of two years ago. 
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said in his bed at home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois Beloeil, in which he had reached the previous day. 
"However, it is always a shock, it is not prepared to be," he says. 
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him, just to go to the toilet and even to eat themselves. 
On the table before a delicious lunch, do he resigned a dinner to help. 
Bravely, it even manages to smile and to talk with the strangers around him, his medication, and he offers a bath. 
The courage of ordinary death. 
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea cure, because this is humiliating," he says. 
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this scourge. 
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man in pinkelt," said Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois home. 
In the period of childhood is to return home for some people an unacceptable humiliation. 
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a step backwards, he says. 
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, great events take place amid these setbacks. 
The patients who are being trained Victor-Gadbois in the home for palliative care, are all suffering from cancer. 
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months. 
At this stage they are doctors and nurses who care about them, no longer with so-called "healing" care inundated. 
For Mrs A., 89 years old, is the worst fear, "deliberately and suffocation" to die. 
But by the disease, I have my children really knew. 
"I have good children," she adds. 
"I have no aspirations in life," she says, before she accepts that she is a mask, which will help it to breathe. 
It is expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit of her son, who comes from Italy. 
In the Victor-Gadbois home, with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in food intake. 
The palliative care will then be used if there are no other options. 
In order to make the deaths more pleasant. 
In Quebec, state residents a bed for palliative care. 
This is very little, given that we all will die one day. 
This is where life continued under the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home. 
Both in terms of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort. 
It granted the dying depending on a word with brandy or Pepsi. 
The diabetics have no longer control their blood sugar levels. 
And death is part of everyday life. 
Last night, we have Mr. X served up a beer, who died during the night. 
This morning, his son is the beer at the foot of the deceased austrinken. 
"We are helping families and patients alike," said nursing director Nathalie Savard. 
The Victor-Gadbois home is not a day like the other. 
As well as an old man of 93 years ago, the last family meeting in the farm and well supported by his bed, while his opening, a young man dies from 36 years ago by his parents, his wife and his two small children is surrounded, tragically, after he has tried everything, in order to survive. 
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years shows," says Dr Christiane Martel worries. 
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois homes come from their homes, 47% come from the hospital. 
Problem of access to palliative care 
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. a care, which is intended to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home. 
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and society for domestic palliative care in Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients. 
It is this major shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several specialist doctors in palliative care for the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concern. 
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent figures of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard lapo man has been signed, in order to express their opposition to such an initiative. 
Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that all right to have a high-quality palliative care before agreeing to switch to euthanasia. 
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, with no action has been taken to their relief. 
I am afraid that the people want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care. 
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite stubborn worst predictions until the last day. 
The survival of Hélène Richard was already minimal, when she broke off a difficult chemotherapy. 
When I told my Onkologin that I will cut off the treatment, she replied that she was sorry that I have given up the fight, they said. 
However, she told me that I was in the end! 
No omnipotent care 
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, the nursing staff, that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been alleviated by a team of palliative care. 
However, it must be made clear that palliative care in terms of pain treatment is not omnipotent. 
Elsie Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal 8% of patients are not in a pain treatment. 
At the end of life, the doctors are thus often terminale Sedierung, which amounts to the patients either sporadic or lasting until einzuschläfern at the time of his death. 
We can no longer act as if we do not take one side of the suffering. 
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminale Sedierung. 
Patients whose pain cannot be alleviated, say all the same phrase: "I want to die." 
But this does not necessarily mean, "I want you to euthanise me," but "I would like to see my pain." 
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian health institutes. 
Housing scandals in Quebec 
Officials of the Straßenbauamt, the bauhaupt industry companies, money providers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell us every day, which they have a great 'system' in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso. 
A "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990s and 2000s. 
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since drastic measures have been taken," witzelt Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal. 
The scandal has been with him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the contracts for road works in Quebec, the former Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed. 
The "Duchesneau-Bericht" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and bribery of government officials. 
"Since the start of the study in 2010," he said, "would have been only the transport ministry saved a billion dollars in the Treaties," because some zügelten their instinct to get their share. 
The Charbonneau-Kommission "has already had two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will be able to "identify the tactics behind the individuals." 
A 2011 set up permanent anti-corruption unit 
The 2011 set up permanent anti-corruption unit is doing with their troops to auditors, establish and analysts of the government too much effort. 
In addition, the police officers of the "mart au-truppe," which since 2009 has meant that the "sewage cartel" of Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties more restrained... 
In the last few weeks has made it mass raids and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard marc otte is the mayor of a suburb. 
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec, has resigned. 
He is suspected, in exchange for public contracts repeated bribes. 
I have been accused, in fact, engineers from the Straßenbauamt of Montreal, as well as Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito. 
The latter has a sensation, giving the Commission the workings of the "system" for the maintenance of public contracts. 
He himself has several years of 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a paid agent in connection with the Mafia, the money to the European Union, Montreal gave the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay. 
Mr. Zambito was in the 2000s his hands throughout the game by more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals have been in power. 
He also confessed to illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau organised. 
Drainage contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him 
In Montreal it worked the "system" of corruption smoothly. 
The former civil engineers Gilles Surprenant has described in detail before the Commission: ten years ago he received from the developers gifts, invitations to travel, Golf-Turnieren, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes in excess of 736 000 dollars in exchange for drainage contracts, he artificially inflated their costs. 
Other officials of the Straßenbauamt have admitted that they could be insuring by invoices with false benefits artificially aufblähten at 30-40%. 
In addition, the organisers of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, Mr. Tremblay accused that he has deliberately been ignored by a shadow budget, which filled its coffers with black money. 
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay in early November resigned, as Montreal plunged into a severe crisis. 
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, suggested the alarm. 
As the mayor of the city district Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, they rejected 2010 against the sale of municipal land for 5 million dollars and 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market has been sold. 
70% black money in election campaigns 
The study, which will be carried out in the end, she says that they "on a thread, which allows the functioning of the system to emigrate from carried to understand, in order to stop the evil, and expose the culprits." 
She says that the process of "painful but positive." 
We are going to clean up the wound, however, need an investigative unit for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices. 
How can we do clean. 
Regularly. 
Jacques Duchesneau, in turn, notes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars," but above all concerned about the role of the "agent of the tactic in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud. 
On the basis of a share of 70% black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he witzelt: "I was told that this was only a weak copy of reality." 
The Quebec government proposes to restrict the donations to political parties to 100 dollars, which he said that nothing would change in the situation: "As long as the election campaign expenses are not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in the policy." 
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the awarding of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "We cannot fall further; by things with courage on the bottom, the House on a more solid base with more controls and laws." 
If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and that damages from Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls on those who laugh to take a look in their own backyard... 
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!" 
In this season, you have with PSG a new scale. 
How do you explain this progress? 
You can see it through a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG. 
Wonderful players are here. 
Every day I am making progress on their side. 
The technical staff gave me too much. 
These factors spur me on a daily basis, to improve my game levels. 
And in a game that is even easier. 
In football, everything is going very quickly. 
But I must stop enthusiasm. 
Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF claire fontaine to my playing time in St etienne, I have always made gradual progress. 
They make up the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti.... 
The newcomers this summer are accustomed to a very high level. 
You also know that every training unit is crucial. 
This means that a player like me, and his best wishes. 
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my playing position. 
He will Co-Trainern support such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me. 
Ancelotti is the right person for the job? 
Of course. 
Ancelotti gives all people respect a. 
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is among the best coaches of Europe. 
He has a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs. 
He has had contact with big players. 
I think that he will win another title in Paris. 
In January, I have an encouraging conversation with him. 
At that time, I was just recovering from an injury. 
The confidence that he has put in me is also an explanation for my performance. 
What do you think about the first part of the season for PSG? 
In the Ligue 1 Lyon gave us the place of the front-runner. 
We lurk in the ambush. 
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the advanced semi-finals in this way. 
What is the objective of the club in this competition? 
We are going to try to get as far as possible. 
From now on, everything is possible. 
However, we are going to be against very good European teams that we will have their say. 
First, we want to start our group in Porto, so that the return leg of the semi-finals advanced as a home game. 
PSG is a major European club in the short term? 
He has already had the budget for it.... 
In order to become a major European club, Paris must win the title and make a name over the long term. 
This is not the case today. 
In financial terms, the PSG the means to ensure that this project takes concrete forms. 
Would it be a great failure, not the title of the Ligue 1 to win, as was the case in the last season? 
Of course, this would be a great disappointment. 
This year, we are really keen to cream off this title. 
In the last season, we were close off. 
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory. 
We ended the season with a very strong performance. 
We have finished with 79 points. 
Normally, it should be with 79 points to be master... 
But another team, those of Montpellier, has reached an even better season. 
I believe that this year is the right one. 
Even though the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have the stuff to win it. 
Do you think that the media can expect a lot from PSG? 
Given what has been invested, and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us. 
We fully accept that. 
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and there is still something you can accuse us, which is certainly a bit frustrating. 
One wonders what people expect. 
We could never every weekend with a 4-0 win. 
We are not FC Barcelona! 
We are trying to set up a game plan. 
One team builds itself with the time. 
In the Champions League, we have strength shown. 
Look at Manchester City, a club for the last two seasons and included fails to qualify for the advanced semi-finals and also a huge expense. 
In terms of the invested money, it was believed to break with 15 points ahead. 
This would mean that our opponents and the French schaft ignored. 
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were of this new "geboostet" PSG. 
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting. 
I hope that we will be in May of the smiling victor and tell us that we have won, despite all the difficulties, after all. 
The PSG seems completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 
So much better that we talk about a "zlatan addiction." 
In other words, that Ibrahimovic is powerful and too many doors. 
This is why he has arrived, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1. 
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star. 
Within the team, we respect both the players and the person. 
He also respected the people who saw him surrounded. 
What he has done is really extraordinary. 
This encourages others to improve their own levels. 
Thiago Silva, the world is one of the best defenders, making it possible for all the others to make progress. 
As you have the Euro 2012 experience with the French national team? 
It is a disappointment. 
It was close to my heart at this European Championships. 
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from playing time. 
I have things seen from which I am stronger. 
Today, it is possible for me to achieve good matches in the national team. 
This has been since my start with the "Bleus" my hope. 
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour. 
What do you have for the first six months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"? 
He has achieved promising results. 
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup. 
The national coach is strict, it is close to the players, and suggests the victory. 
It was also Laurent Blanc. 
But I would not make a comparison. 
Blanc had achieved his goal by making us qualified for the European Championships. 
I hope that Didier Deschamps, the "Bleus" will lead to Brazil. 
Is the forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1:1) an address? 
This game has given us confidence. 
Everyone has worked for everyone else. 
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career. 
With Bitcoin payments and selling without a bank is possible 
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identify transactions and administrative fees between the parties involved. 
Moreover, as so often in these technologies a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies will lead to financial crises. 
In fact, Satoshi naka moto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc. convertible) and a protocol on the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files. 
With 15 000 computers in the network have already collected around 200 000 transactions. 
Several thousand Web sites accept Bitcoin as a donation or a payment. 
After the rate of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later he fell to 2 dollars before he now has recovered to around 10 dollars (prices are on the website bitcoincharts). 
Nothing particularly Beeindruckendes compared to the global trade of real currencies or financial products. 
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currency interest shown for this purpose. 
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies." 
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the " ," which will be used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes exchange). 
The social network of Facebook has also developed such a system. 
However, the trade is constantly monitored and dealt with by a central authority. 
Bitcoin are all network hubs at the same time repositories of the accounting book, auditors, financial issuers, as well as buyers and sellers. 
How this network works? 
Any transaction between two users is in fact between two Email addresses through an Email. 
With the difference that the user can choose to pay a different address, which ensures the anonymity. 
A number of information related to this transaction will be electronically signed by a double encryption system. 
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction. 
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the widespread accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available. 
The decisive step is to sign this new transaction in this book. 
This is done through a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line. 
It is a carving up the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint. 
The computers "are" the new transaction, and they add a figure before the whole thing will be "dismantled." 
The aim is to find the figure, which is a special fingerprint (many noughts at the beginning). 
If this figure has been found, the other knot can easily check whether it is the right one. 
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint. 
If a user on the Betrügen two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for, would only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other remains without any link, because they have different fingerprints. 
The computer, which has solved the task, receives 50 Bitcoins. 
In order to prevent an inflation rate that reward will be regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012. 
The circulating Bitcoins is thus limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionstel divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.... 
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power. 
The life of the network has already peaks and troughs. 
The Web sites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen from the Bitcoin-Einlagen. 
"The weakness is not the real record," said Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay with real money, and Bitcoin is using the network. 
The European Central Bank also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service. 
However, it also has cash on these shortcomings. 
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind. 
Others, such as the Twitter-style Word press will accept them. 
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation. 
In November, a "Mega-Schlussverkauf" started. 
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company coin abul, the Bitcoins converted into gold. 
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network. 
His Paytunia system is in line with a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin for the validation of transactions, which are cheaper. 
In addition, the holder managed its identity and can therefore remain anonymous. 
The system can be easily implemented in the shops, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs. 
You must simply indicate an address from a telephone "photographed and identified," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users. 
It is a general trend in which the hierarchical systems for more horizontal required systems are being reviewed. 
"It will take some time before Bitcoin wins, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted. 
The ECB is, in fact, in its report, the various today as a highly regarded risks in the event of a success to revalue its currency. 
We are withdrawing from Afghanistan. 
And after that? 
French troops have their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi). 
NATO and the United States should follow suit at the end of 2014. 
It is time that the Afghan army is taking back the property of their territory, and that the Afghan people will decide their future without anything to expect from us. 
We have particularly punished the Afghan farmers by we have seen them as terrorists. 
And even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and mutilated. 
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but also often from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets. 
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks. 
Does, sometimes backed by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there if the Western countries are more subtly. 
The withdrawal of French troops from the outpost in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill planted with almond trees, using the French loans has been financed, has been carried out properly. 
The überflogenen trucks and armored konvois of helicopters have Kabul, without being attacked. 
From the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more than the Taliban in Kabul. 
Since its irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed. 
At the time Kabul was empty and the country because of the struggles of the various rebel groups from the war. 
Their arrival was seen as a kind of liberation and return to security. 
The Afghan women have the price of the obscurantism of the al-Qaeda organization overthrew farmers paid for, but their situation has still not improved. 
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position. 
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war are back to power. 
They have turned into traders by land seized by the government, as construction of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell and benefit from the massive American subcontracting. 
They have been discredited, and most of them were not even involved in the fighting. 
As I have heard in the campaign, people want a government that is not composed of thieves. 
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who have been able to make the American contributions to use: capital flight is considerable. 
The young people have the war and its ideologies. 
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have made contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed their benefits. 
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, and a fifth of the total population. 
In the cities, state schools full of girls and boys. 
This is a young man, not the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders want to return, there will be jobs available. 
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, will be seen everywhere. 
An army is now there. 
Will the authorities under which authority it will be considered legitimate? 
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already seeking the restoration of the militias in the province, which will take away the power of the central government. 
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities would benefit from a certain degree of decentralisation in the case of the Western nations, but by abolishing the post of prime minister, which has been in existence since the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralised state with a strong presidential power. 
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014. 
However, it is his country since the 1950s and has long been dependent on foreign aid. 
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning power stations are non-existent and important irrigation systems have not been repaired. 
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced. 
The private initiative will be a priority. 
In a country which has been devastated by 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructure needed. 
The rumour was spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources. 
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on the ground, in order to conquer it. 
Without energy, in order to process the iron or Kupfererz on the ground, or without transport for the export of the mountains, no mining is possible. 
The Chinese have the copper mine has been almost abandoned by Mes Aynak, the international archeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site make their digs and remain the main employer in the province. 
One day, it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely one and exports depend, to restore normal relations. 
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November. 
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and young gymnasien, Institute for French universities, very institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sector, in support of the archaeological delegation. 
Since 2009, a service "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which has been halted in 2012, in dozens of mountain villages in numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation, in order to try to win hearts and summon " and the impossible task of the compatibility of assistance and proactive actions to achieve. 
This work, for which many local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and improvement of agricultural land. 
What souvenir we leave after military spending of two billion euros? 
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions, often at a level of more than 2 000 metres the valleys are very hard. 
In the message, there are dozens of written questions of small agricultural projects undertaken by local authorities in the province of Kapisa. 
If the farmers get rid of the rebellion led by foreign groups, and their desire for their own statements, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and directly affecting civilian aid to their advantage. 
A constitution with a sledgehammer in Egypt 
We are talking about a new poker game of President Mohammed Mursi. 
While Egypt in terms of the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily granted the unlimited power, more than ever, remains divided, he has decided to put everything on a card. 
To the surprise of all, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly on the next day will adopt its final version. 
In just a week, the leader of the House had two extra months for the completion of its work. 
Egypt is building now for almost two years on an interim, amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess. 
This new initiative has only ensured an even stronger division of the country. 
As far as his opponents remained the president in his "autocratic frenzy" by continuing to "break his word" and "the right underfoot." 
On behalf of his supporters to be assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process. 
In the space of 14 days, a referendum should be held. 
A very short period, forcing the brothers to dispense with their project, the Egyptians to explain the text section for section. 
For the President, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protest is raging throughout the country. 
After excess, in an interview with the American weekly Time Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably. 
With the Egyptian people with this resort to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either is true to her for my draft or I reserve the unlimited powers," the latter should end after adoption of the Constitution. 
85 mostly Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere. 
The majority of the Liberal Democrats has not complied with the request. 
On the eve of the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they were turned away because they believe that they have not been able to bring their views into account. 
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally. 
In order to achieve the quorum, yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members added. 
Some people are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood. 
It is not surprising that the articles were usually unanimously adopted. 
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for the prayer, because some members of the panel were of the opinion that the Pendeluhr of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate. 
The text, which has not yet been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles. 
Article 2, which drew all the attention, after all, is identical to that of the constitution since 1971 and says that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law." 
The salafis parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope that "the principles" by "the rules" to replace a stricter application would have made possible. 
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, a proof of their good will and for their respect to the other members of the Egyptian society. 
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see only as propaganda. 
After all, according to them is the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles. 
In particular they have in mind, Article 220 of the Al-Azhar University gives an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the conformity with the laws of Sharia law. 
According to the Ägypten spezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because " the people who are being asked for an opinion, are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy. 
You can see the first signs of a theocracy." 
The fears of the Liberal Democrats are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of the university is far less likely to be more moderate than the present. 
"At the moment there is no specific religious commitment. 
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state. 
Most lawyers, who have been working on this text, are not Ulema, but academics, many of whom have been trained in the French system," soothed Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition. 
But he admits," that in relation to Article 220 may be an ambiguity, because the terms are borrowed from the religious vocabulary. 
It is here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence Red.]. 
Moreover, the question could be raised in future, whether civilian courts are competent to decide." 
Apart from its religious aspect, it is the last text strongly criticised because of the far-reaching powers he granted to the President of the Republic. 
The Muslim Brotherhood argued that they compared with the former regime are significantly reduced. 
Another sticking point: the powers of the army. 
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget was not submitted to Parliament, but a National Defence Council. 
Similarly, there is no prohibition of civil proceedings in military commissions, as the groups have called for the defence of human rights. 
The latter also share their concerns with regard to the text of which they see as threatening freedom. 
The offence of blasphemy is being maintained, and insults are now banned, with serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press. 
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch. 
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36. 
This word was not included in the previous constitution. 
While the Egyptian president last night had to speak out on the television, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon. 
The supporters of the head of state will demonstrate Saturday. 
In Israel expect Ukrainian tourists who visit holy sites, the centre of the world and a sea of Sole 
The promised land united in glories biblischer truths, modern comfort and a pristine nature.

Galilee is the place where Jesus delivered his miracles: the transformation of water into wine at a wedding party, walking on the water, the Seesturms and the fish. 
It is here that Jesus was his who after the resurrection. 
The most sacred thing can be found in Jerusalem. 
Believers are repeating the ordeal of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa). 
The path starts with the Roman fortress Antonia Pretorium, where the court was, and through the streets of the Old City to the mosque church at the Mount Golgotha, where the kreuzigung body, the salbung stone and the tomb of Jesus. 
This is Christian view of the centre of the world, which symbolises the escape of the human race. 
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is the place where a Christian legend, the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus. 
In Jerusalem, it places the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remnants of a temple of the Römers in the year 70 AD has been destroyed. 
Traditionally left people of various faiths notes with wishes, which will then go into compliance. 
A trip to 
The ruins of the Massada fortress are the remnants of the secret hidden enemies, Herod the Great in the year 25 AD was built for his family. 
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains amounting to 450 metres above sea level. 
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins of their own. 
All the others on this historic summit. 
In the north of the country in 1600 by 2040 metres, the famous ski Hermon, in which large numbers of tourists during the winter months. 
From the foot of the mountain, you get there with a Shuttlebus. 
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometres. 
According to an old legend who were supposedly pagan gods at the mountain summit. 
Unique museums visit 
In this country, there are nearly 300 museums. 
If only a trip may not all of them will be visited. 
But at least the five most interesting of them should be a visit. 
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (parliament).

In Akko you can the museum in Bad Al Basha visited several rooms of old Turkish spas with sculptures of the visitors and Badediener houses. 
In Caesarea, you should the unique private visit Ralli Museum, where sculptures of Dali and Rodin can admire. 
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops. 
The entry is free, and donations will be rejected in principle. 
The fifth museum, which is the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the appalling chapter of history. 
The ergreifendste section is the memorial for the children, the memory of the 1.5 million children in the concentration camps and existence were destroyed, has been built. 
When I came into the room, there is complete darkness. 
Stars sparkle. 
And they ring out the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died. 
Ukraine is also mentioned there. 
Something for health 
The three main areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea. 
In each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, Delfinarien and Ozeanarien. 
Amazingly, in the Red Sea in the winter months, as the water temperature of 21 degrees Celsius and the air to 23 degrees warmer. 
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there will be over the whole year. 
By the way, this unusual sea with a situation of 417 metres below sea level is the most convenient sea in the world. 
His türkis blue water has a high salt content and makes it even schwimmer easily on the surface. 
The surrounding landscape is unspeakably beautiful. 
Visitors come here for treatment using salt water (natural salt sole) and sludge, as well as for the treatment of skin entzündungs, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, a disease and to calm strapazierter nerves. 
The mysteries of the ancient 
This mystery is the ancient city of Tel Aviv, which is the Jaffa city on the Mediterranean coast. 
This city has been the famous sea, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. 
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and altägyptisch legends. 
Traditions, Noah built his Ark, and Perseus rescued the lovely Andromeda, with whom he had a long and happy life in this place. 
Tourists like schlendern through the narrow alleys, which are named after star marks. 
Fortuna is the legend to hold all the walls in the alleyway with their star sign. 
In Jaffa, you can neuvermählte couples from across Israel and even other countries with photo opportunities. 
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can roam through the Roman theatre and the fortress of the crusader. 
In the Roman period Caesarea was the main city of Judäas and residence of the Roman chieftains, including Pontius Pilate. 
In a carefully renovated theater are now listed at konzerte and operas. 
List of characteristics for tourists 
If you go to Israel, you are not worried about your poor English-language skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian. 
The money in the rice will be in no euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to Schekel (current rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 Schekel). 
In the city you are progressing with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast tram and in Haifa, the only U-Bahn-Linie of the country with six stations linking the city with the city.

From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousands of Ukrainian tourists into the Promised Land, which compared with the comparable period in 2010 in line with an increase of 51%, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011. 
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language 
While MPs and human rights activists discuss what benefits the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already taking action with counterfeit certificates 
Every year, 13 million migrant workers in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities. 
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. 
Their only goal is to pay for the upkeep of the remaining families in the country to earn money. 
On 1 December, a law entered into force, according to which every working immigrant is a test of knowledge of the Russian language. 
So far this arrangement applies only to migrants in the services sector, in the local housing economy and want to work in the retail sector. 
But the tests with the federal immigration agency in the future for all migrant workers on duty. 
It is not only the language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation. 
Languages need both for the preservation and the extension of work permits will be proven. 
The exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian language is. 
Also excluded from this law are people who have their educational certificates and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991. 
And protection of human rights 
The entirety of the audit will be under the aegis of the puschkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of friendship among the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg Staatlichen University and other Russian universities. 
The migrants will be able to take the tests in all the cities; already in Russia have already opened more than 160 such centers. 
The initiative to introduce the tests was made by the members of the State Duma and supported the federal immigration authority. 
Human rights activists, however, came before the entry into force of the law in the press on several occasions the following question: what does it actually mean? 
What changes is the rule, language skills, both for the Russians and for the migrant workers? 
Above all, from spokesman for the immigration authority, it seeks to reduce the number of forced labourers. 
"Many people are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the federal immigration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew. 
Their rights, however, must be protected before their departure. 
Only an organised recruitment will result in 90% solve the problems of foreign workers. 
On the problems facing migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical evaluation. 
Sebelew is convinced that a future without language skills will meet people with bad intentions, which put him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow cabin, where he met with dozens of his peers months without food and documents left and 12 to 14 hours a day work. 
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants. 
"In the home, you are the one promised, and you will be cheated at the arrival, get their passports confiscated and do not receive the promised wages," confirmed the head of the main management of labour migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow. 
It is not moaning, boss! 
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they not only do not speak the language of the destination, but also in their own language hardly can express in writing. 
Of course, this is not so much their guilt, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can also only make a sound basic education. 
After all, in their families, there are still not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and school matters. 
As a teenager to take these children then immediately the first opportunity to earn money. 
"It is difficult without language," she admits. 
"You humiliated and inferior." 
Human rights activists stress the important aspect of the law. 
According to the test, only migrants with legal status. 
Do you not do this status, there is no scrutiny and therefore no official work. 
Meanwhile, the bulk of migrant workers remains illegal in Russia. 
"Welcome" or "access to banned" 
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain an official status in Russia. 
The reason is bureaucratic and, of course, the linguistic problems. 
Moreover, the legalisation will cost: 12 to 16 thousand rubles. 
A fake registration can be found quickly, and only for one and a half thousand. 
The staff of the Russian police are aware that our documents largely falsified and we are not registered, and then arise from cases of blackmail. 
"You want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajiks Umed Huschkadamow against journalists. 
"But spare no costs for false papers." 
Back in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified. 
Some counterfeit certificates, which besch some of the language tests, were employees of the federal immigration agency. 
The fake papers have been printed with an ordinary colour printer. 
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant, who hoped to be able to stop the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles. 
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this will cost a migrant worker three thousand rubles. 
The most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought, both officials and human rights activists agree. 
For the moment, the authorities can immigrant workers, who are covered by the test for the first time, just promise that time for a language course. 
In addition, newcomers without language posts offered in areas where no active consultation with people is necessary. 
Interior ministry denies illegal arms market 
Percentage of legal weapons to crime extremely low 
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners. 
This means that the authorities are reacting to the recent events: people have been wounded in shootings at weddings and seven deaths during the killing spree of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow. 
The police want the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years. 
According to the proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee for security and corruption, Irina Jarowaja, support and promised that the changes in the arms bill will soon be submitted to the Duma. 
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities, the problems with "hold the screws" want to fight. 
The Internet has been published an open letter, whose author - representatives of various armed groups - are demanding from the authorities of "senseless." 
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC. 
According to the statistics of the Interior Ministry, there were 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total 1 168 thousands of offences were recorded. 
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals to operate on the black market. 
At the moment, you can, according to the authors in Moscow every possible weapon for little money. 
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control. 
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers 
The weapons arrived on several channels on the black market. 
There are five main channels, told a former Col. Viktor Baranez, the ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff. 
Screenshot website, which takes up arms orders 
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus. 
"The weapons were both of the Russian officers and the Kaukasiers itself stolen," Baranez says. 
On the second channel illegal weapons, police defenders are stolen by criminals. 
Baranez explained that this weapons count, both from the armouries of the police force and directly by members of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen. 
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arsenals. 
In many military camps, there have been frequent explosions. 
"There is evidence that in some cases of arson was to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel. 
A contribution to the black market, according to Baranez, the arms manufacturers. 
"Today there are countless private arms factories, which do not stand up to the international competition and therefore the weapons on the black market, such as in Moscow," said the expert. 
Another channel of the black market is smuggling. 
Many guns and guns come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan. 
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a Mafia, organized smuggling," explained the former military personnel. 
Where are the weapons? 
Experts calculated what percentage of each of the five channels in the supply of the black market with illegal weapons. 
In 2011, a report was drawn up by the Centre for analysis and public administration. 
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the federal service for state statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the issue of weapons. 
The vast majority of illegal weapons came from, according to the investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities. 
Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the "guilt of those responsible in their work to do with weapons," it says in the report. 
According to the data of the researchers, 17% of weapons from conflict zones, 14% of thefts in the arms production, and 5% comes from illegal excavation. 
A sales adviser of an arms shop were to do, who does not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal digs, for a long time no one is buying, because they are outdated. 
He said that it is more likely that traders in a military camp. 
More than a Fähnrich is a weapon, for example a pistol from the TT type bought. 
The weapon will be issued and passed through the fence. 
"The dealer brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he said 
"The police, of course, know all about them, and that is why, if the plan for the detection of crime cannot comply with periodic monitoring purchases by traders by offering illegal weapons," the advisor adds. 
"As in luxury shops" 
Buyers and sellers find most acquaintances with each other. 
I was looking at websites and blogs, as someone who has been paying attention to me, and I suggested to the station "Begowaja," where a person would wait for me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price. 
The price of the weapon I was told 
Military commentator Viktor Baranez 
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need a friend, contacts," the adviser said. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him." 
There are traders on the markets, but we must go there and have agreed on a code such as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, which is that the daughter has lost a tooth." 
I am now even in some newspaper syndicates about an acquaintance, whom I trust. 
He gives me the networks simply because he knows that I do not verpfeife him. 
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways. 
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez tried in the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject. 
The models according to him have not changed. 
He was given a photo album, where "everything possible" was contemplated. 
"I felt like a luxury shop," remembers the military personnel. 
The buyer gets Baranez is not a pig in a poke, but can try everything. 
I buy as a potential customer is not only easy, but it will go with the seller in the forest, and that is where we are a target. 
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," the expert describes the approach. 
Shopping on the sofa 
Internet search engines show search results on Web sites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons "for various purposes" are being offered. 
It will not require any documents or there are personal meetings. 
"You need just the right amount money," it says in the advertisement on the website "pistol or rifle purchase." 
That is where users give your orders and ask questions. 
It is also being sold to minors? 
"Of course, without a license," asks users, "Ivan" (direct quote). 
"Kaufe a TT: Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow." 
The Federal Security Service attacked recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers want to buy the weapons, the service on the Web. 
The people are like hungry fish to feed and then end up in Siberia and coal 
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez 
I have heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply. 
The authorities are taking the orders. 
The buyer has the money via a bank machine. 
"As a response he receives a photograph and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," told the press officer of the non-profit organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow. 
Viktor Baranez stressed that it would also be left empty-handed at the end and may be behind bars, if you have a question placed on a website. 
The Federal Security Service attacked recently a number of bogus websites, and buyers want to buy the weapons, the service on the Web. 
"The people are like hungry fish during the feeding and then end up in Siberian labor camp and digging coal," he says. 
A Makarow for $100 
As for the purchase of illegal firearms, experts say that with prices of 100 to 900 US dollars. 
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" may be a pistol from the Makarow type to buy 100 to 300 dollars. 
You have to wait for up to one and a half months. 
The weapon is in military arsenals of country supervisors. 
According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry was the number of offences of illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22,9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7,8%. 
In the United States are junk food and supermarkt employees 
One in four American young people is sitting somewhere behind the coffers of Mc Donald 
Over the past few days, there have been everywhere in the United States for massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will increase even further, or whether they will soon return to the air. 
The protests of trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations supported. 
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers are the organizers of the protests which aim to set up trade unions. 
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized. 
46 cents per year? 
The protests began last week after thank giving the so-called Black Friday, in which Ausverkäufe in the United States took place, the anlockten millions of customers, which sometimes led to Handgemengen. 
On this day, some walmart workers, of whom 2.2 million worldwide, their work and bestreikten, along with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targeted people of low and middle-income countries. 
Walmart sells all products, comes on hunting guns and car batteries up to saugers dust, eggs and milk. 
The commodity in the walmart branches is averaging between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets. 
That is why buy many of the minor paid walmart only one of their own jobs. 
The prices and the range of goods on Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States. 
Critics say that can often simply the goods Wal-Mart, so cheaply, because the employees are poorly paid. 
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or scanners. 
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to their own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars per month. 
A typical walmart worker, who earns 9.5 dollars an hour, could not afford this increase, they said. 
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley show that if the company's average wage increase to 12 dollars a hour, Walmart 3.2 billion dollars would cost. 
These are approximately 1,1% more than they now pay. 
If Walmart wage increases fully pass on to customers, each purchase cost them in the future only 46 cents more. 
Every year it would be for them in comparison with this additional spending of just 12.39 dollars. 
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that only in nine states came to protest and that the company sucking any losses. 
The Black Friday took in his Lades of 8 o'clock at night on Thursday until midnight the next day, and in this period Walmart approximately 5 000 items per second. 
All in all, the walmart insurance companies in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions. 
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that as a whole "less than five" walmart workers laid down their work, and the protest campaign is just "another PR stunt" by the union, which organized the protests. 
"Free pay!" 
The protests began this week in New York, where their aim is not, however, walmart branches (which are not wanted in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants. 
McDonald's says that the company sell billion chickens, and yet you have no Krankentag, and you will not be paid for your honest work! 
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council 
At present, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation at 7,25 dollars an hour. 
In fast-food opportunities the minimum wage will be gradually increased, but not too much, and on average its ordinary staff in New York 8,90 US dollars an hour. 
Less than they deserve no one in this expensive city. 
As it is possible, in New York with so little money, is beyond me. 
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's has stood behind the Theke, but the young people still lived with their parents. 
No one was seen as the main source or planned to stay there. 
Now meet me in interviews with staff members of McDonald's permanent people who complain that they live on this wage and sometimes even have to feed their children. 
On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal a comment, the author says that it is irresponsible to have children, if we do not know how to feed them. 
The participants in the protests on Thursday at 6.00am in the morning before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue began, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food opportunities will receive a minimum wage of 15 dollars an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage. 
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry. 
The US law prohibits corporate governance to stand in the way of this objective, and abzumahnen, or to lay off union members. 
On the other hand, the corporate governance is not easy. 
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons. 
The main reason is the high turnover of staff. 
Malcontents 
Strident protests on this day, there were also many other fast-food opportunities in Manhattan. 
The climax of the protests was an assembly at midday at the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says that it sell billion chickens, and yet you do not Krankentag, and you will not pay for your honest work!" 
The demonstrators were from other prominent New York Democrats support, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food workers together, so that they receive a fair wage and can achieve the economic prosperity that all New Yorkers deserve!." 
According to the New York Times it was the biggest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry. 
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from all are employed in the fast-food industry, in the work of tens of thousands in New York. 
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise the entire masses. 
"The brain can be so far only" 
The supporters of modern technology popular theme of the enlarged reality in recent times usually perceived through the lens of a special lens. 
First, Google was presented in the summer at its annual conference a working model, in November it was announced that Microsoft had filed a patent. 
In a conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, but it is clear that the lens for the scientists of the company was only a staging post. 
The ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual free spaces. 
- Please briefly describing what research your group. 
We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction. 
So far, humanity largely stuck in the phase in which it is working with Pixeln on flat screens, which are sometimes also affected. 
We want to look ahead 5-10 years and anticipate the radical changes of this interaction. 
For example, the Xbox-Konsole and the Kinect-Sensoren are a step forward, and today is no Xbox without Kinect sold, because everyone interested in management. 
- As far as we are still expected in the future? 
- Although Kinect interaction has brought on a physical level, a lot is still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D. 
The submission of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the issue has not yet been decisive. 
We are trying to change the work on real three-dimensional presentation systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections. 
We have to lay off the computer world in our physical world and make them more tangible. 
To this end, it is essential that not only the user, but also its surroundings. 
Then we could make the real world much easier by adding virtual objects. 
First, we should take this crazy virtual reality wearing loose! 
- What do you think about language management? 
It is popular, but it will not be overvalued? 
- It is certainly not the Allzwecklösung, because they are issues of privacy, because they do not always all others would like to inform them about its actions and intentions. 
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers are good, but each in their particular niche. 
For example, we were working in the area of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and narrow, rather than experimenting with sprawling gestures. 
In doing so, the gestures were not from the camera, but by a bracelet he always wore recorded, which observed the movements of the bones and muscles. 
It is still relatively large, in theory, however, could be reduced to the size of a Armbanduhr. 
But on the whole, however, is the future of mixed management types, such as Gestik and language. 
- How? 
- We would ask me, for example, to reach out to you this Sprudeldose? 
They say it and show at the same time. 
- Normally, I will say it simply. 
- Oh, it would be very difficult to see. 
Does this mean that you want to see the user adapt to what a machine at any given time can do and what is not? 
- Not necessarily, but we are talking here about a mutual rapprochement. 
I think that in the near future, above all, work on the development of new sensor types, which allow reactions of people to grasp. 
The laser sensors, for example, can be, because they offer a good dissolution, which is very important. 
- What are you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect-Sensoren on modern cameras? 
In the absence of dissolution, depth or anything else? 
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the area of three-dimensional detection. 
Of course, there would be 8 mega pixel with a speed of 1 000 fps is not a bad thing. 
But the main thing is not the pixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth. 
In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough, because the designers of the algorithms have more work. 
It is not only along the X and Y, but also along the Z-Achse will be taken into account. 
The speed and the number of images per second are important. 
The movements of human beings are extremely dynamic and, frankly, are the present 30 fps, especially for gestures to little. 
Stephen Betishes developed a sensor in our laboratory in Redmond with a regulierbaren processing delay between 1 to 100 mm, with the current commercial carriers closer to the second value (60 to 100). 
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction between man and machine. 
For my work, I was just a device, only without reserve management and with more images per second. 
- If the number of cameras will not be increased? 
Kinect is currently working with three "cameras," with one of them actually an infrared station, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal. 
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB-Kamera. 
It is not used to calculate the depth. 
More cameras could possibly solve the problem.... 
Or exacerbate the problem, given that more calculations would be necessary. 
It would be nice, a flexible, Kinect-ähnliches system in which we could play with different tendencies, to see how we can help in the three-dimensional identification of a position. 
- If I remember rightly, Microsoft was in contrast to Google his lens is not the public. 
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects? 
Of course, it is not pleasant, always en route to a smart phone in the hand, but I think the following: the tollste version would be a "rotating" enhanced reality, in which we have a cloud from the lens of the smart phone tune 
The lens is a personal 'gadget' and therein lies its strength (leaving such personal matters, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness, because it prevents an enlarged reality through glasses that you work with others in virtual objects. 
Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual Hologramme in the air is not only Tony Stark Iron Man, but also sterblichen. 
There is a problem to which critics of this idea often: there is no noticeable reaction. 
The hands are feeling nothing at all! 
What answers to your group at this point? 
- In my lectures, I often refer to the enlarged reality the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine. 
I believe that the eighth breakthrough may well be the integration of the taktil perception. 
An interesting method is currently using the second hand as somewhat unusual instruments. 
It takes pressure very well! 
But there are also technologies, which are actually aimed at the "pictures in the air" Festival, for example, the collision produced by some rays at a certain point where the finger is a feeling at the moment but it is still so weak, as someone who pustete about appearing. 
There are also Bänder on the wrist to the Nervenendungen in the fingers, which is also a potential direction. 
- Did you try to outsmart the brain? 
I think that we can see what it should feel when it is just a little? 
- This is a good idea, so we have not yet tried it. 
This is another task with which we still have to fight for a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually endless space; here, we are working on concepts with bands (other than spreading through gyms), mobile platforms, as well as large pellets. 
So far, we can only outsmart the brain, and we still have many busy years. 
This is precisely what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher: in many areas, we are only just beginning. 
Eigener taste rather than culture - rosbalt; ru 
Rosbalt, the project "Petersburg avant-garde," the city dwellers, who are the vanguard of the arts and culture. 
On the elite list have already landed senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose achievements go beyond the borders of the city, and often acceptance in Europe, without the rest of Russia to be known. 
The new hero of Rosbalt is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller. 
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red at the Russian Museum, in the summer, at szene or at Vernissages. 
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they attract large numbers of people. 
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg philosophical artists, who are creating new myths. 
Kirill Miller is a shining figure in the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. 
He is also a man of the city and set by his presence on the road to his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour. 
He recently grabbed a Drehorgel and was Drehorgelspieler at the Petersburg, as he has for this difficult role in terms of his art, his philosophy and his image was finally ready. 
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example in amber or Türkis in the city en route? 
I have the color red, as fashion designers, which deals with the optics and the image. 
In this world red is the compromise between artists, spin-doctors and society. 
In the society, everything differs from the norm, aggression and bad behaviour. 
I want my provocations with the people who come into contact. 
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to the conversation. 
- When will you wusstest, you must be painters? 
- In an exhibition at the Newskij Cultural Palace, in which my work was issued. 
I realised that I must go down this road. 
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painters at the time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible. 
I befreundete myself with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it was a "Puschkinskaja 10," and then was first brought to an end. 
I am the theatre, fashion, music, at all, apart from the literature. 
- And all this in your Art-Klinik... - it was important, at the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should meet. 
In 1995, I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there was up to the renovation a musikalisch künstlerischen club for the Boheme, the home of the Petersburg Boheme. 
Many were born there: N. O. M., Tequilajazzz, and I remember, too, such as string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" was there. 
String and his friends sang simple songs on the play back, wearing tight T-shirts and was also the composer Igor Wdowin today. 
When the group began to play live, it was out of its "Leningrad." 
Trachten facilitated many programmes before the era of "Halli-Galli." 
We gave them trachten, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us. 
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the Art-Klinik. 
To have our staff and passengers. 
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something. 
In the year 2000, there have been in the press a survey, when it comes to the award "personalities of our city." 
I won in the category of "artists of the year," and so I have reached the peak. 
It is not easy to work in a new era under the old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century. 
At the present time, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution. 
Your work has a distinctive style. 
- Many of my pictures are real gems and make clear the timeliness and thoroughness of the ideas expressed. 
I will be an exhibition on the theme of "the Russian Museum as clowns." 
Clowns are timeless. 
In the past I was social, but now it is painful and is afraid to be so. 
In a clown blurred and loses his tragedy. 
I love the absurdity, and I have bizarre ideas. 
Let us save the world by telling people that everyone has to dress up completely. 
Now everyone on the clothes and modelled on the exterior, and not on the inside of the human being. 
But perhaps we should not give a man, but he should face spucken. 
The deception is disappearing through the Verkleiden. 
Recently we saw you in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers - as a cultural city should have a hero. 
Who, if I do not? 
- Commercial art can be nice? 
Nowadays, commercial art must be careful, thoughtful and flattering. 
We are seeing the disintegration of cultures. 
In the past people were large groups: the Bohemiens loved one and the ordinary people the other. 
Now there are micro communities, and it is hard to please everyone. 
I am not a hundred dollar notes, which everyone likes it. 
Now you have to think about whom you will like. 
Now, each country star around 100 followers. 
- With regard to the presence of Stas Michailow but several thousand! 
He abandoned women, where the sexuell Social sphere plays a role. 
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything is based. 
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved. 
In my youth, I have painted these pictures from a collector, even in a number of the works of Falk and Larionow. 
I started with images which normally come at the end of the career. 
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings. 
It says: ' Intellectual culture and consumer culture. 
Consumption has absolutely no culture, which is something quite different. 
I am a man of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty and money. 
This is the culture, which I support. 
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg? 
- Good. 
It says: "Servant of the culture. 
But not every one of them can deal with culture. 
In the real tsars, it was different, because the tsars may not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that proper experts are needed. 
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers. 
In St. Petersburg, we have what could be the experts, but they will be barred, because there is a need for hochrangigerer experts to assess the former right and pave the way forward. 
Now it is only their own taste. 
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters must find other museums. 
- What is for St. Petersburg? 
- St. Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture, in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground. 
Our art is difficult to grow. 
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we have become more writers than readers, and this is not true. 
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts. 
We are much less. 
Art must again be modern, as at the beginning of the last century. 
The project will help the city St Petersburg 
Birth in outer space 
Earth in danger. 
Global warming or collision with asteroid killer. 
By guiding caravans of ships with Erdbewohners on board in the search for a replacement planets. 
In order to save the human race, the important question is how we are in the catching or on the planets can breed? 
Many choices are not in my opinion. 
De facto, there are only two real planets, which we could inhabit at least hypothetical. 
"That is Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the astronomical Vladimir Sternberg-Instituts Surdin. 
But while the conditions on Mars are comparatively benign, there is on the surface of Venus with a temperature of 500 degrees. 
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, which is in space. 
The issue of reproduction in all of the researchers treated first with regard to the flora. 
As early as half a century before the experiments were carried out with plants. 
The fourth generation of peas produced in orbit is not the least of the species. 
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit. 
In 1979, leier sent into space to explore how the catching impacts on the development of embryos. 
It is becoming a normal chickens. 
But then the problem begins. 
"The problem is that the chickens must be found; it is on its feet and start to move," explained the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew. 
Without fixed underground the chicks beat. 
Ten hours later, stumpften the instincts of the newborn full. 
The chicks were not reacting to light and loud. 
Four days later, they simply died. 
"Twice we have chickens and then found the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space. 
The last breeding cage with animals flew 16 years into the orbit. 
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue. 
But the Biosatelliten "Bion" are only same-sex species. 
There was an experiment with rats, which had already been fertilised, were sent into space. 
In principle, it was found that there was nothing special. 
"It was just about the Biosatelliten, but once again it was only a single experiment, and research must be continued," said Vladimir Sychew. 
After the landing, the space rats were young. 
The issue of reproduction directly in space, it has not yet been resolved. 
The task is difficult. 
Animals, which are snatched from their natural habitat, can simply do not follow their reproduction. 
In contrast to human beings could in principle. 
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background. 
For ethical considerations, such experiments are not carried out. 
But women have been flying for 50 years at all. 
The greatest risk was Tereshkova. 
The most precious, humanity is the female organism. 
Our Möwe flew, and no one on earth would have been able to answer the following question: is it the space flight? 
Will it after this flight can bring a child into the world? 
"After all, nobody answered this question," says space veteran guard tang Watschnadse. 
In June 1964, only a year after its space flight, bore the first female cosmonaut, vale Christina Tereshkova, a daughter. 
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut. 
In 1988 has given birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit, and even work outside of Raumfahrzeugs verrichtete, a son. 
However, there remains a risk. 
We have only very few Kosmonauts, where, after long flights it all went well, and they got healthy offspring. 
"The more, the more dangerous it is, even in flights to orbit," Kosmonaut Waleri Poliakov quite rightly concludes, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation. 
However, the human race for new ways of biotechnology, radiation protection and the Erzeugen artificial Gravitation. 
The Hydrolabor in the centre of Kosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight. 
Here in limbo the Kosmonauts routine for the work in open space. 
The water is catching. 
Even if adults feel comfortable, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element. 
It is as if the little Ichtyander testimony that life on the land towards the ocean. 
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in amniotic, and that it may be easier to get used to water. 
In principle, this is logical, because from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks. 
"It is too little time to forget something," says children's swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa. 
As for a newborn child, the catching is a much more natural condition, the woman is not without gravity. 
In the state of catching the belly and muskulatur basin very quickly and it is also the ability to extract the child. 
Well, we deal with sending aid. 
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer, in order to extract the baby. 
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Poliakov quite rightly. 
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity. 
Without the Erdanziehung feeling, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles. 
A newborn child cannot be in orbit as an adult for training will be put into a suit. 
He will simply miss what is crucial for his life. 
"This experiment, which we jointly, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will mean that we have a disabled person, a completely unangepaßt man in the world," says the head of the ethics committee of the Institute for medical and biology problems RAN, Igor Pestow. 
So far, the birth of children in outer space theory. 
At some point, but it will be a reality if the people in their space ships on a distant planet, which is the home for their offspring born in space. 
NKÚ-Chef: control of the black market system failed by fault of politics 
The Czech Republic, in connection with public procurement of good controllers and adequate laws, but falls in their application. 
In the conversation for Aktuáln, cz says that the vice-president of the Board of Control (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala. 
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case," Kala commented on the current situation. 
A similar outcome is apparently also a joint control by Czech and German investigators. 
As a negative example of how practical it brings the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Ne?as to the so-called "black system." 
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls, the system is now prohibited or permitted? 
"A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not easy for the government chairman, and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work," Kala notes. 
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint tschechisch-deutsches project, in which the laws of both countries were compared with each other in terms of public contracts. 
What was specific? 
It is a parallel examination, with which we started about two years ago. 
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature decides how to handle public contracts, and that is what we are building on the national legislation and, finally, there is the actual practical application. 
This is all we have compared with each other, and although the test is not yet complete, we saw very interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps even a little "more severe and perfect," the actual application, however, is in Germany in some parameters better. 
This confirms that it is not enough to keep new and more precise rules, but we must also deal with the actual application of the law. 
How can you help? What is for you from this project? 
It is such a common control could help that we stop, we are constantly perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if this does not seem particularly positive. 
Economics is one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to acquire and illegal enrichment, or even criminal acts. 
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal. 
Perhaps it is even the case that the system in this way only with excessive "red tape" burden, and those who are looking for the gaps in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds were higher. 
You are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law. 
How does the control system in Germany? 
Is there a similar body like our NKÚ, or the system works differently? 
As far as the authorities are concerned, it is the German equivalent to the NKÚ of the Federal Audit Office, which is similar to us, and also has a college, which will be formed only slightly different, but both authorities in principle are similar. 
The powers are comparable to a certain extent, while Germany is a federal state, which means that these bodies are also in the individual Länder - the German system differs from ours. 
The BRH can only control federal funds, which is in line with our state funds. 
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities, where they are subject to the control of the provincial Courts. 
As far as the German legislation is concerned, which is easier than ours? 
In general, I would hesitate to compare without specific details, but nevertheless, Germany is in some ways often described as a model, but we certainly cannot say that Germany is better at all. 
Is it perhaps because that is where the auditors are better? 
It is not certain, but as I said, such comparisons, I may not be very happy. 
It is also important to note that even those countries which are a model for us, also have to contend with problems. 
Otherwise, they would have nothing to do with cooperation with our authority, not true? 
With regard to the Czech legislation, the importance of your authority the revision of the procurement law, you have any impact? 
Given that this revision is in force only a short time, it is in our tests yet. 
Since our inspections take place, you need to be here with a certain delay. 
We feel so far more in the preparatory phase of future controls - as we have the new control instrument "detection of risks of inefficiency" and with this almost 14 000 public contracts examined and analysed, the changes will have an impact, of course, because the threshold values change, the conditions have been modified for certain types of contracts, etc. 
Do you think the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with more bureaucracy? 
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that confirms this assumption. 
It can occur, however, the problem is that the rules will be "tougher" and can no longer be met. 
Under the previous rules, an audit unterzogenen individuals in relation to the winner (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) accountable, that any breach of the law on public procurement is tantamount to a violation of budgetary discipline. 
Does it make sense to make the law more rigorous? 
I do not think that in this way. 
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse, and not punish a procedural mistake, which did not impact on the actual decisionmaking process. 
Such a system requires only bureaucracy under even greater pressure. 
Where is the way out? 
Let us start by which way is not effective. 
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs are not in control of the so-called "black market system" would reform - what exactly does that mean? 
If the system is now banned or permitted? 
A law is valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it is not simply the government chairman and the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law is an obstacle in his work. 
He can say: "We change the law and allow the matter," but he cannot say that we are doing so as if nothing would be. 
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain transactions - and this is also true for the protection of public competition. 
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidders with the best offer alone will be excluded because of procedural errors. 
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and this is what I think is missing. 
In the streets, there is some Eisglätte, they are mostly but dry. 
On the streets of the Czech Republic, there is some snow and Eisglätte. 
Mostly, the roads are good, sometimes, increased caution. 
Karlsbad 
In the district of Karlsbad, the streets this morning are good, there was patchy snow and Eisglätte. 
Temperatures fell to - 5 August to -10 degrees Celsius, it should be a little warmer. 
In the region, it is now no longer or snowing, and the underlying bone is only a thin snow cover. 
The Kamms are, however, about 30 cm of snow. 
According to the county road monitoring because there was fog reduced visibility. 
The R6 highway and the roads of the first class in the region are now fully navigable. 
However, for example, attention is needed on bridges, on which the lanes are sometimes frozen and smooth. 
Befahrbar are also all routes in the second and third class roads, including the mountain roads. 
On these roads, however, remain frozen or current blocks of snow. 
In particular, in the higher elevations, it is therefore necessary to draw attention. 
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové 
On some streets Ostböhmens risk because of Eisglätte in higher elevations and in the mountains, there is sometimes a current snow layer is still on the streets, shares the roads and motorways headquarters on their websites. 
The Straßenmeistereien drivers warn against Eisglätte, especially in higher elevations in Pardubice district. 
In addition to Eisglätte, it can, especially in the second and third class in the Lankroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polika, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto. 
The streets 1/43 and 1/34 Svitavy are chemically treated. 
Snow is particularly on the roads in the mountains and mountain Orlické hory. 
The current snow layer is on the streets of Rychnov nad Knnou and Trutnov. 
In Ostböhmen, it is now mostly sunny and pleasant, and it remains largely rain. 
Temperatures vary between 3 and + 1 °C, a weak wind is blowing. 
District of Pilsen 
The streets in the Pilsen today are good, but local is more attentive, and the driving is to adapt to the weather. 
This is wintry morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point. 
Since it has snowed before and temperatures fell, it can be on the road to Eisglätte. 
Locally, it is also likely to be with fog, with the view, however, will improve in the current year. 
These figures come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien. 
The highway D5 is virtually fully navigable, increasing attention, however, recommend the Straßenmeistereien between the 80th and 131 kilometres. 
The lanes of the first class are mostly dry, but frozen. 
In the south of the Pilsen and Tachov circles, it can, however, blocks come to Eisglätte. 
The lanes of the second and third class roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible frozen sections. 
Drivers should focus on the less congested roads in the area of Bohemian Forest to be particularly careful. 
District of Olomouc 
With the snow matsch must now rely on drivers who travel in the district of Olomouc. 
According to the use of cluster vehicles, matsch snow on the ervenohorské sedlo passport, as well as on the road towards Videlský kí. 
Overnight snow forced the Straßenmeistereien to use, fell in the umperk circle, according to data from the road management around 3 cm Neuschnee. 
In the rest of the district, the lanes are usually fully navigable. 
"Umperk will remain in the circle in the most snow. 
At the passport ervenohorské sedlo, the driver Jeseník with matsch snow," said a member of the umperk road management today with regard to the Agency's TK. 
Even their colleagues in the Jeseník circle had to get out in the night, according to data from the streets and in the free and wet after chemical treatment. 
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are fully navigable, ternberk drivers, however, must be careful to drive in forest sections, because the lanes are still wet. 
District of Ústí nad Labem, district carried out by Liberec 
In northern Bohemia, the Straßenmeistereien several bad road sections. 
As well as several places with snow or Eisglätte, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice Ústí CE K. according to the traffic police. 
The temperatures remain in lower elevations below zero, so that snow and ice on the streets, from the low levels, particularly southeast from " the mountains are no problems reported, and that is where the roads are usually dry. 
So far, no traffic disruptions have been reported. 
Eisglätte, particularly in the vicinity of ttí reported. 
According to meteorologists there were ideal conditions in the night, rain and melting snow, clear skies during the night and frost. 
Among the main lines, as well as from the road 1/13 on the border of the districts CE L. Ústí and carried out by Liberec poor transport conditions are reported. 
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was on the basis of wood from the snow load up to. 
Imon Ornest: on our concerts, we want to see positive energy gain 
What do you think about it, that in less than a month is due to take place in the world sinking? 
This is one of those doom, which we humans are so keen to anspringen. 
With our band The Tap Tap we are more likely to laugh and say that we are the only band in the world, which can collect enough positive energy to stem the global decline, or to prevent. 
In December, you also carry out a unique project with three concerts against the world's demise. 
Can you give our readers closer to presenting the project? 
It is a nationwide benefiz event, which we have been planning for two years. 
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya-Kalenders, whose end on 21 December at 11:10 o'clock is forecast. 
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, from 21:00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava. 
The end of the concerts will be at the time on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a time zone is 12 hours ahead, the maya calendar. 
Who comes from this idea? 
Originally, we have followed the idea together with our Honza Augusta Grafiker. 
In doing so, we would like to not only collect sufficient positive energy, in order to prevent the world's demise, but we also want to, together with the public to think about what condition the world to give our children. 
At the end of the Maya-Kalenders, we have a unique range of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters of the world, with its purchase of e-tap.Cz we can also support the people. 
The band The Tap Tap, along with other singers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title "world's sinking comes from." 
Even today, the national anthem is very popular on YouTube; it will also ring out at the benefiz concerts? 
Of course, and finally, provided that everything works and the world does not take place... 
The anthem of all the singers at all three concerts will be sung at the same time. 
Moreover, the anthem will be combined in a direct broadcast live by Czech television. 
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus plays in Videoclip Xindl X, singing along with... 
How are you working with these two? 
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, which is connected to many benefiz events and concerts.... 
We are trying to make these people actively involved in our projects. 
It has shown that most interested in cooperating with us, and we have enjoyed it. 
What purpose is the proceeds of the concerts against the world? 
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, which we already have six years together with the club Tap in Jedlika-Institut work. 
The pupils of Jedlika-Instituts are regularly cared for by teachers who help them in various leisure activities. 
As the students themselves do not have the means to visit the teachers, we want to help them in this way. 
In the context of the completion of the Jedlika-Instituts is to create a separate building in which we will move forward with this project. 
At every concert, several groups and performers are appearing. 
What criteria do you have chosen them? 
We wanted to set up a programme that addresses all generations, including children. 
In Prague, for example, are Chinaski, Lesbiens arm, Illustratosphere Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý. 
All the more you know on the website, kpks, cz. 
Are similar "big events" are also planned for the future? 
In May, we are, for the first time at the Prague Spring, and we are preparing an interesting programme for this concert with interesting guests. 
Next year, we would also like to occur in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we then start in the United States, it would also like to appearances in Washington and Chicago. 
Their plans are not exactly small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow. 
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities. 
How do you deal with these logistical and organisational? 
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight. 
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the rolling chairs must be transported in the baggage area, and we must, of course, many instruments briefcase and other luggage mitschleppen.... 
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, that I have been surprised sometimes in part. 
Even in Moscow, where we recently were, there were no problems. 
By your foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility, as we are dealing with disabled people and so on. 
How have you seen these things? 
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, where everything works better than ours, we were in Russia just witnessed that everything in the East still is in its infancy. 
With regard to Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, where it is still unusual, if someone on the bench alone in the city centre. 
It is not yet again, of course, that you have a wheelchair in the lift vorlässt, for example. 
Fortunately, there are clubs who are trying to address the problems faced by people with disabilities. 
And to what extent we have to make up for the more developed countries? 
There are still many things where we are lagging behind.... 
It is also important to note, however, that an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of the people concerned. 
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities independently in the public sphere, to move into the museum, can use toilets, etc. 
It is not exactly normal, however, that a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social life, we are with the band The Tap Tap the West a little bit ahead. 
Respect in the public domain and accessibility is one thing, but only if our great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, things will really start to change. 
So far, these are only cases of particularly strong personalities. 
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years ago: what did you in 1998 motivated to create a band? 
At the time I started in Jedlika-Institut, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with a little too busy. 
And since I am myself musicians, including Saxofon games, I have, along with a colleague founded a Musik-AG. 
Oh, and by the time it is, as our presenter, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a runaway (laughs). 
It was the band but only in the last few years, or I am wrong? 
It is true that the cooperation with well-known Sängers has helped, but we have also begun to actively campaign for us. 
We have become aware that if you do something and the outside is not to see their own performance in a certain sense does not exist. 
Thanks to the EU funding, we can be good teachers, good quality equipment and etc.. 
Was it your goal, with The Tap Tap so far? 
From the outset, I sensed the potential that we can tackle the things differently. 
The branch is now often copied to the others. 
This is logical in its own way, given its novelty with caution, and only after some time will be accepted. 
There are only a few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap. 
The first impression of viewers mostly is, of course, sympathy; it is only natural... 
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned creatures, which we would regret. 
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided that they have the necessary resources to do so. 
I always say that if people with disabilities can do something, not just for themselves, is a step forward, but for the whole society. 
Was it helpful for this success that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people? 
If you want to do something good, we must not compromise on many points and must also demand a certain discipline. 
This is in my view, but quite normal. 
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and when they discover that they have twice a week to carry out preparatory periods and spend much time on concert tours, then stops the enthusiasm among many quickly. 
That is how it works, but everywhere, in every band who work seriously and wants to achieve something. 
At present, The Tap Tap twenty members. 
How many of them were from the outset, i.e. since 1998? 
Only one: Láa Angelovi. 
We are an open group, but the people come and go, and this cannot be avoided. 
Anyone who has the will and the desire of collaboration is always welcome to us. 
If, rather than on the day before the projected global decline, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9pm 
Venues are as follows: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Brno and Plynojem/Fléda Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians 
All three venues will be linked to the conclusion by live and erklingt a common interpretation of the anthem "sinking" of the band The Tap Tap. 
The aim of the concert is the funds for the installation of a multifunctional accessible educational center that under the name STUDEO is to be created in Prague in Jedlika-Institut. Cost: CZK 25 million 
The entry costs 400 CZK children up to 12 years free tickets are Vorverkauf available at Bohemiaticket. 
Poland and the sky. 
Last week, Poland was at a ministerial meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency ESA as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, was the ESA-Mitglied on 12 November 2008). 
Poland began in 1994 close cooperation with the ESA and participated in the following years on several ESA-Projekten. 
Poland's path to space, however, began much earlier. 
Even before the Second World War Polish kosmos fans with space, and so that they do not always met with understanding. 
For example, I would like to remind everyone of the presentation of the ternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thought from his pioneering work presented "entrance to the Kosmonautik." 
The ideas of the young engineer (we. 1905) left the audience cold, and after years ternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in his work had shown. 
Ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the Kosmonautik" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch created Prix REP-Hirsch. 
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1966) was later an important supporter of astronomy and space. 
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines. 
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of space has been acknowledged, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him. 
Back in April 1925, there was a Eisenbahn-Draisine built in Poland, where a rocket-propelled was planned. 
The author of the draft and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown. 
It is not even clear whether the rocket on the launch or on the brakes of the Draisine should be used. 
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press. 
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket propelled shells. 
The research led the Institute niki Komórka Uzbrojenia, in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi. 
The ancient documents show that the research has been spilled into the stage of practical tests. 
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht. 
In 1937 appeared in the press of mine. Rohoziski a photo elektrischen rocket, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna rakietobomba i lotnicza," the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky. 
Both projects dealt with the military use of the Raketenantriebs. 
Shortly before the war, all projects on the military use of missile technology from the temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy). 
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, it was his work, however, from the start of the war to an end. 
Other articles on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press. 
The first mention of this society is taking place in 1954 in the November edition of the journal Problemy, in which four major articles devoted to the space industry. 
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz, contains the proposal to set up an aerospace company. 
At the time, there was already the first projects on satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space would have future. 
As early as at its inception in 1956, the Polish aerospace company PTA for accession to the International Federation for space, founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA has been a member of the autumn of 1956. 
The following year was the first PTA-Vorsitzende, Kazimierz zara kiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space. 
This office he had until his death in 1959. 
Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research. 
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch was carried out on 10 October 1958. 
The missile with a maximum altitude of 6 000 metres was around 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kilograms. 
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built, and in 1959, began on the Bdów-Wüste flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2. 
The missile was 1.4 metres long and weighed around 11.5 kilograms. 
Another development stage should already be in a position to provide real scientific work - the missile RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 kilometers and for the monitoring. 
In 1962, however, further development has been halted. 
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM, the Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years 1962 to 1965. 
The missile was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the take-off weight was 32.5 kilograms. 
This missile has developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which are separate from each other in the size of the transport area distinction for scientific instruments. 
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B about 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C about 0,62 per litre. 
The maximum altitude was for all three types of 37 kilometers. 
In the years 1965 to 1968, the aviation institute developed the Meteor-2-Rakete, whose first flight tests began in October 1970. 
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kilograms and was able to take a load of 10 kilograms in a total of approximately 60 kilometers. 
After that, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 are being built. 
It is also worth pointing out that the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, in which two years later was followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR-Ausschusses. 
Poland participated in the framework of the Interkosmos-Programms space research with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski after the Czech Vladimir Remek second kosmonaut. 
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution. 
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the law on voluntary work. 
This decision called on the public to have a lively debate. 
It is certainly an interesting issue from a broader perspective. 
The liberal oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition. 
In effect, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other. 
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand. 
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), it comes to price tensions. 
Under this concept is to understand a situation in which the manufacturer is trying to import cheaper goods in economic competition by competition offers " to make a larger market share and to increase its profits. 
On a large scale this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or abandon their business, and the result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs. 
Since the private capital is not a social responsibility, and hence no responsibility for it causes unemployment, necessarily increase government spending. 
This situation is compounded by the fact that, the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thus caused overall social economic and social damage. 
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this stage are superfluous. 
The reckless practice of private capital gives the individual economies a situation in which governments are forced to engage in competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own people and to attract foreign capital into the country. 
In other words, the governments are providing their own population without regard to the social consequences to private capital. 
This is reflected particularly in changes in the existing legislation. 
The aim of these measures is to force its own people, the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages. 
This is partly by economic coercion in long-term unemployment, on the other hand, through the curtailment of workers' rights. 
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing disparities between rich and poor. 
In Germany, there have been a few years in public food distribution for poor people, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work. 
The number of people affected are already in the millions. 
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly on cases where workers receive such low wages that the state their income must increase to the minimum subsistence level. 
Such a scandal was also in the case of staff members working in the German Bundestag. 
The austerity measures virtually all EU-Südstaaten will undoubtedly amount to the same situation, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social standards are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance about whom on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point private investment capital will flow into the country. 
This naturally begs the question of where this capital is coming from? 
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all the employees working for a fraction of the European wages. 
This affects the whole of Latin America. 
Liberal theories and the media claim ad nauseam that the state is not with capital to its own economy, and that a planned economy will lead to economic disaster. 
The private capital is insisting on his position that the state should not interfere with steering in the economy. 
Then we must ask whether the private capital policy, and thus affects the entire state in its own selfish sense or even draws. 
Here is the clear answer: yes. 
The proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all lobby in all the Member States. 
The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption, mutual preference, a legislative process, in which virtually everything, but nothing is punishable. 
In Germany, the situation is such that a government ministry of finance private companies densely intertwined with the industry charged with the drafting of legislation. 
These draft laws are subsequently adopted by the Bundestag. 
All the violence is no longer enough by the people, as Western nations, but also by strong financial groups, who prefer their own interests. 
It appears that the liberal democracies are quickly caught up in a situation as they Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic to Caesar and pomp 'times' describes: "The state has long been in decay, and the posts have been filled by violence. 
Bribes, illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword. 
The corruption rampant, and the people had already bought votes in the election ..."" people with nature is not stopped for offices, so that the state resulting from the decline eight months had no consul... " " you really began to talk about it, that the only medicine in this difficult situation an autocracy, and that there is a strong man to be elected... " Appian pomp ', but the strong man was, after all, Caesar democracy permanently replaced by the dictatorship. 
What is clear is that today's society, as well as in the ancient world to the ruthless preference for their own benefit, without having to pay attention to overall social interests. 
The private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to recognize the benefit of the whole society. 
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest effort to make far-reaching reforms. 
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries. 
From the current state of view, the demise of these regimes can be seen as a pause in liberal democracies, in which the next round. 
The most disastrous is the fact that today's elites in future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, whose witnesses we are already today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance. 
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution, at least not permanent. 
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to make the social level of people down. 
This trend is therefore systemic. 
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms, which will increase the shareholding of the state of the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state. 
Israel: laboratory of chaos. 
..." That nothing comes from violence, or could ever be created," Sting sings in the song, whose main verse of the song reads: ..." so that we do not forget how fragile we are." 
"If my sons do not want, there would be no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1949 
In the wake of the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, a myriad of responses. 
There are those who stand behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians describe as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli state, which committed genocide against the Palestinian Arabs and describe the state of Israel as a terrorist. 
At this point, I would not write about who these recurring waves of killing more guilty and who is, ultimately, the people who live in Israel, including the self-governing areas born into the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence. 
It is a question for me to open the readers behind the scenes, to whom the tension 95 years (expected from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small speck of land in the Middle East in particular. 
My thoughts are based partly on accessible historical facts, while others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influenced the events of modern history. 
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power. 
In every era, we can Alexander the Great or Napoleon. 
What is less obvious is the question whether it really is the people themselves were autonomous in their steps, or whether someone was behind her throne, drew their actions to a fixed target. 
We must admit that we live in an era in which the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resultant power is not within the life span of a generation that has been created. 
Among these astronomical rich families particularly stands out, which could be described as head of the zone (I do not know whether anyone else, but I do not rule this out), the Rothschilds. 
But much will not be written about them. 
It is understandable. 
The first press agency (Reuters), the Rothschilds have already bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, in order to link their name with criminal acts, in light of the consolidation of its power, the proliferation of their assets, or both. 
The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip itself to these (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were seven countries, following the attack on Iraq, there were five countries, after the fall Ghaddafis, only four, with Russia in the meantime, the Central Bank of the Russian government has suggested). 
Whoever tried to confront this family had to pay with their lives. 
Abraham Lincoln refused the status of Rothschild Bank of America to renew as the Central Bank, began during the civil war, their own (read: government) to release notes and 1865 murdered in a theatre. 
J. F. Kennedy began to publish their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; Mr. Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Federal Reserve for triggering the Great Depression in 1929 to sue. 
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859-1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Pik, a Masonic of the 33rd and highest level of recognition. 
The first war was aimed at eliminating the big monarchistisch state of Europe, with the second war, in particular the British colonial rule, is to be broken, and the third war, the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their benefits and their luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the runup) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power. 
The method with which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the top, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (chao - order from the chaos). 
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like those of them in 1907 caused no repeat). 
After the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution. 
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economic unfounded Germany's capitulation (for the destruction of the Russian Russian empire, the war is no longer necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower was ungarns. 
DISCARDED 
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought the establishment of a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historic Judäas area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion). 
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the precondition for the mass migration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first clashes with the local Arab population. 
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides. 
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke from the chain, which had initially kept the international bankers, or whether everything was going according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any case, created the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps the condition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community. 
Israel was founded in 1948, and, as well as by the reparations war against Germany, is preparing the ground for the Second World War, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War. 
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people along the lines of the Second World War to the victims in the frontline battle, this time, along with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East. 
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (as people sharply divided into supporters and opponents of Israel). 
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice is wrong in an endless spiral of violence, but at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power? 
It is between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as with us, the people, only their own candidates for election. 
DISCARDED 
In what light the words David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order." 
In its presentation, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves. 
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of aristokraten. 
A world in which every newborn baby in the birth is a chip implanted, in order to subjugate the very essence of total control. 
"And it is that the small and large, the rich and the poor, the clients and the Knechts all the eichen malt in her right hand or on her cheek, that no one can buy or sell, because he was the eichen malt, which is the name of the animal or the number of his name. 
There is wisdom, who consider the number of animals. 
It is a man's figure, and his number is six hundred taking sixty six." 
The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood appeal 
In November 1979 occupied a mob demonstrating Islamist students at the US Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage. 
For their release they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi have had fled after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the Patronat of his regime. 
For the American government, there has been no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as the confidence of its allies have been severely damaged in other countries. 
At the same time it was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages. 
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt of the hostage exemption made everything worse. 
The captured diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were mediated by the Algerian government. 
The fate of the hostages at home called a wave of solidarity, as well as Iranian sentiments. 
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980. 
The Argo film by the director and Schauspielers Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which the United States led a small partial victory. 
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff on the flight. 
This ended after numerous delays in the residence of the Canadian ambassador. 
According to the CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, and helped them an extravagant story on the Verdeckung of their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes, the alleged plot locations visited for a science-fiction movie. 
The combination of Genres 
The expert on "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan also made Hollywood's cooperation necessary. 
This means that the camouflage was credible, published articles on this film project in journals, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office. 
The details of this operation were long kept secret, but the film is based on the memory of Tony Mendez. 
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres. 
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Caper Movie," i.e. the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as the film Ocean Eleven. 
This change in the film, the mood levels - on the one hand, the own scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences). 
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, ironic and slightly excessive. 
And then there are the scenes from the CIA-Zentrale and other institutions - men in suits at the table, at the flurs office, on the phone.... 
Ben Affleck is a remarkable start with this film of his career success. 
A derided actor has become a respectable director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic comments. 
Argo is his third movie after the thrillers no pushover (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010). 
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in Boston by the director. 
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that the previous films by this director of standard Hollywood -- contrasted with. 
Affleck is proof of this sensitivity, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played." 
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events which have actually taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its simplicity, and gives the feeling of Verwirrtheit and the unpredictable nature, which, if the story. 
A similar effect Affleck with his team, even in fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran). 
Too much action in many places 
The director also had to deal with that history does not really many exciting moments in the cinema. 
With the little he has been working quite successfully, and he sometimes helps the reality - which has not always been so elegant (the scenes in which the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran will be averted by a telephone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, are a bit curious). 
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to spend a lot of action in many places to show. 
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood officials are very charming, but their characters deserve more space, and so that they are in the film far from alone. 
Afflecks film that it loses a little traction, and it is a film with some interest and the design and the Retro-Stil, reminiscent of a thriller from the 70th years goutieren. 
Enthusiasm, however, makes it difficult. 
As a reminder of a day in some way living piece of history, and as evidence of how excessive the notions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services, but it is enough. 
Guidelines for the Aufblasen of balloons, for bananas and for the circus 
The server bankovnipoplatky, an annual survey on the oddest bank fees devoted, decided this year, the competition "absurd regulation or idea from the EU-Werkstatt." 
"This idea has brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU, a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organization of this poll, compared with the newspaper Právo. 
Among the nominated aberrations, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of social security charges for men and women. 
In the meantime, women enjoyed life insurance an advantage, because they are objective for the insurance companies pose a lower risk. 
"Further incredible incursions from the EU-Werkstatt can be nominated until the end of this year. 
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013," Nacher said. 
Among the controversial regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol for fuel, which is natural in its wake, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because this is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen, because of the eggs in this year were much more expensive. 
Criticism has in the past as well as the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even the sales ban on conventional incandescent bulbs. 
Bananas must be 14 cm 
The EU machine is often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more member countries (the Czech Republic is currently trying to, for example, with veto threat to the demands of Czech banks). 
Lobbying interests were also behind this, that bananas of the highest class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not a "size abnormality." 
The European Commission defended with the argument that it merely inconsistent harmonisiere national standards, which would impede trade. 
The rules on fruit and vegetables were made by the EU against the resistance of some countries have already softened by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food. 
One candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU regulation last year, the balloons in the sale must be accompanied by pointing out that children under eight years ago the air balloon must not be allowed without supervision of an adult aufblasen. 
The EU called for an American study, according to balloons, are the leading cause of the suffocation of children. 
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten. 
Kuriose incursions are also at home 
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which the European officials themselves - anyone who plays an official role in the EU, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece does not use the name Macedonia, and must instead FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). 
The server Bankovnípoplatky, named in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists Laissez fair, in addition to the above-mentioned aberrations, the EU regulation on the amount of food supplies in the territory of a Member State. 
The EU has set the maximum volume of food supplies, which is on the day of our accession to the territory of the Czech Republic. 
The Czech Republic exceeded the prescribed amount for canned mushrooms, for which we have a large fine. 
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries money should be given to ensure that they do not have a sea, or the idea to provide funding for applications for funding. 
These ideas, however, did not come from Brussels, but also from Prague. 
"We are penalized because we have no sea. 
We will be at the EU's request for reimbursement," in autumn 2004, the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD). 
The argument led to the cereal harvest was very high, and the state camps were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases. 
Since the Czech Republic has another route to ports, the EU should Palas several hundred million euros to pay us. 
The European Commission, the Czech Republic, after all, so far that it is a call for tenders organised on the purchase of grain from countries which have no access to the sea. 
Funding for applications for grants from the local authorities, the Ministry of Regional Development headed by Minister Pavel Nmec (US-DEU), it should be specific about funding for the establishment of financial aid applications to Brussels. 
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception 
Regulations will be easy in the Member States to the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation, and thus also for efficiency and the development of the entire European Union deserves according to some experts, however, more recognition. 
A serious problem, according to these experts is more EU funding for projects which nothing, together with the deepening of European integration, but in the budget negotiations were imposed by individual member countries. 
Emotions at home also raises the fact that the Czech Republic like other member countries in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products must fight and this fight does not always win. 
The Czech Republic after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term 'Olomoucké tvarůžky' defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský sold short), whose tradition dating back to the 19th century, our manufacturers had to "Tuzemák" redefined. 
The name rum is only allowed for products from sugar cane destillat to be used for products from sugar beet. 
In the official list of products registered in the EU in the society of the world famous cheese, feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipan or the parm ash inkens Zwieback now also of Karlsbad, carp from Pohoelice and Tebo, or even the Saazer hops. 
With a EU-Marke Pardubicer Lebkuchen or Hoicer. 
"People want me to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," Okamura said. 
Mr. Senator, how is the idea to stand for the office of the president? 
It is not for me to be a senator or president. 
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would get nowhere to stand. 
But I can no longer see how the republic will be plundered for 20 years, as thieves walk free, while the taxes and the retirement age will be increased. 
I had no ambition to become a politician. 
But when I see something which I do not like, then I am trying to propose a solution to change this. 
And since I am already more than 40, and independent and French departments, I have no other way to influence the situation than for the senator or the president to stand for election. 
In the Senate, you have succeeded, and then on the road to the castle. 
You will not let your constituents back? 
I have told the whole time that the battle for the Castle will begin after the outcome of the senatorial election. 
Later, I have clarified this and said that I will be standing for the office of the President, if I am elected to the senator. 
My goal is not the function and the function is an instrument with which I can achieve my vision. 
For that I do not need as much influence and a strong mandate. 
The problem is not only that we as a people in the pub and on the television, but anyone who wants to make a difference. 
Then there are the media who want to deprive the privilege and freedom of speech with the freedom to confuse them. 
For me, for example, it has been claimed that I would be bribed or that I was by Jiří Paroubek. 
Are we talking about your dreams. 
The fight for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retroactive assets of over 20 million kronor. 
To this end, you must change laws. 
As president, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals. 
How are you going to solve this problem? 
As an ordinary citizen, I have argued that the travel officer remains a free trade, and this could be enforced. 
The problem is the petty politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and it is only on the population. 
As an independent party, I have a far greater potential support from all the parties represented in Parliament to win. 
My advantage is that I am without schublade thinking and party dogma from any party that can take what is the best for our country. 
Do you see yourself as a person in politics rather than the right or the left? 
From the Czech perspective, it seems to me that people would rather see the left. 
I find this left-right thinking but completely irrelevant. 
For me, it is important that we move forward. 
It is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right wing; I would like to bind the people. 
I am always in public every good solution, even if this KSM or of the ODS, and I am opposed to bad ideas as well. 
I hate you if someone described you as populists. 
But you do not confirm this by what you just said? 
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have a goal and a vision. 
And do you want to get closer to this. 
One may describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by key experts. 
But without support in Parliament you are only buzzwords. 
And if you are in politics not long term. 
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people, we will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability? 
I have no other option. 
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them on our side, in order to achieve these goals. 
As president, it would not be a problem for me, the leader of the parliamentary parties live on television to call the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to lay down the law. 
And then, if necessary, the Angesprochenen would have to say why they do not. 
A strong personality, which draws attention to grievances, can exert pressure on the political scene. 
Look at the direct election of the president, who was a result of public pressure. 
I say quite clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual. 
I am trying to find allies for my views and vision. 
In politics, I have only just begun and I am trying for my programme to find the support of the majority. 
I always try to assess the situation itself; and if it does not work, then I would go in six years in the private sector. 
This sounds a bit as if Okamura save the Czech Republic. 
I am not a savior. 
I know that I am not alone; that is why I have discussed this with several well-known personalities, whether they do not want to run for the Senate. 
I spoke with Radim Janura, for example, but refused because of overwork. 
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jan?a Lorencová, who discovered the fraud in the trade in light fuel oil. 
My candidacy, I began with the premise that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure. 
Sixty per cent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have chosen most representative of the establishment. 
In the Senate, we are just two independents. 
People have chosen such a composition that changes will be very difficult to implement. 
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and county chief leaders. 
Do you think about the establishment of a separate party? 
I have not yet thought, because I have no time to check every potential party member, and do not have the money to do so. 
I have no money for the presidential campaign; my transparent accounts are no more than 20 000 CZK. 
You have no money? 
You are talking about asset declarations, how would you? 
My property value at approximately CZK 60 million. 
In Prague, I have a piece of land with a value of 25 million, an apartment for around 10 million, a further 8 million, an art collection, which is about 10 million worth, as well as an Ashton Martin for 3.5 million, and a kodu Superb, around a million is worth, and then I have a couple of million in the bank account. 
The Ashton Martin was, in fact, a childhood dream - James Bond liked me always, as he was driving in the car, was galant for women, and at the same time fighting against evil. 
You are a Ashton Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign? 
You say that you want to change the republic, but your own money you do not want to invest. 
This is not very convincing. 
I did not have 15 million for the campaign. 
What I am going to make debt? 
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign. 
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my programme may not be too much interest. 
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from its own resources. 
The costs of the campaign are basically covered by my salary as a senator. 
But the senator content I could not live alone, such as my son, I could not finance the English school, the 30 000 per month costs. 
If I just wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing. 
If you continue to act as a businessman, in order to have your livelihood? 
Are you saying that you are going to cut back these activities? 
But this is not related to the size of the salary. 
As promised, I have my activities partially scaled down. 
For example, for example, my deputy director in the spring of the travel office. 
People want to see me as a Samaritans, who saved the republic. 
But I must also live on something. 
At which monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur? 
Approximately 200 000 to 400 000, and this is still the case. 
As President, I would stop my actions. 
The complete conversation you find in the Saturday edition of Právo. 
The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure is not only in mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created book - 2 photos 
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and once again there is something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the roadside. 
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearby farm, says: "But it is nice, the house." 
But I wonder why we still need a library. 
They all have the Internet, iPad and electronic books. 
No one is still voluntary in one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or? 
Spijkenisse, a little survey sleeping town before the Rotterdams doors, is an odd record holder. 
The 80 000 inhabitants municipality has the lowest rate in the entire Netherlands. 
In order to counteract this unfortunate circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to education and the seven imaginary bridges, which are described in the notes, a handsome bepinselt de Stahlbetonminiaturen. 
The success of the education campaign has remained in check. 
And so the city fathers realized that there were only one way of statistics: a library! 
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architectural office, master of the audacity Balkenende diagramme and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003 with five books at arm and a grin on the face. 
And while the jury looked bewildered and while 'perspiration' zuckte, stapelte of the impudent Maas his fine Mitbringsel the size of a pyramid and ended his aktionistisch speech with the words: "Love urban community." 
This is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called boeke mountains. 
Nine years later, the 30 million euros. 
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground car park, supermarket, postal services and a few adjacent homes and houses with a total of 50 homes. 
In early November, with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012" excellent. 
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award nomination in 2012. 
This is the faceless small town retorte, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, whose white facades would be inclined to suggest a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture. 
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence. 
The long road to the book 
The first impression: eldorado under glass. 
There is a lift to the middle of massive mountain, but the real space and happiness in the fußläufig climbing the topography. 
The strengthened compartment is bright and clear, the klinke bed and the elegant street taking unambiguously speak the language of a public city centre. 
The urban atmosphere is perfect. 
It is already looking for dog and football playing boys and Mädels. 
And, everywhere, books, books, books. 
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle, there is a large, dark space that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas. 
We have the classic konfiguration upside down and the reading of externally imposed. 
The interior of the bergs book is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and technology center. 
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, verkleidung, Brüstung, stieg. 
Pulp, Haptik and smell are alien. 
Even die-hard architects and Bauingenieure shake of the unknown material the head. 
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager for the local community Spijkenisse, to question the standard. 
And so we are in a friesländischen farming one day on a suitable by-product from agriculture. 
For many years, they used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields, a millimeterdünnes plastic vlies as a root canal. 
This is cheap and efficient. 
The dünne textile holds a two Saisonen, then it is ripe for the Sperrmüll. 
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - about four centimetres thick plates. 
Under heat and pressure textbooks are the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material, which is a bissl for new cars and a bissl smells like sports shoes. 
After 105 stages, we reached the summit. 
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long schaft will be in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch Krokettes and eingetopft Ficusbäumen. 
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right air humidity in the mountains. 
Donations for the new soul 
"You would not believe, but this House is, despite the many glass spaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," Trouborst says. 
It will be Geheizt and chilled with geothermal energy. 
Although the book is under a glass crash, the sun shines, even on sunny days only briefly in the home. 
The broad Holzleimbinder, which are all on the outside glass, serve as a Beschattung and catch a large part of the sun. 
The climate is very pleasant. 
The rest get automatically built. 
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT sector, have already dared the way into the new library. 
Even Lisette Verhaig was already there. 
And Cynthia TCM-Lehrerin Bogarde, the boeke mountain as a Spijkenisses "long overdue soul." 
The reason: in order to open up a few weeks ago, each resident has been invited to donate a book from his personal stock. 
This should start the optical gaps in the not yet fully library - currently 70 - will be filled. 
The concept is good enough. 
The shelves are filled by obenhin. 
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas. 
"I think that, thanks to our invitation has now all residents to have a certain relationship with this new home. 
Everyone knows that his books are part of this building. 
And if it is only for grace. 
This MVRDV has been the central discipline in jargon called identity. 
Spijkenisse has literary history written. 
That is how young and uneducated it may be. 
This is at last a starting point for identity. 
Szabo said: "Germans must play a greater role." 
Germany has been in the vote on the admission of Palestine to abstain. 
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europäische relations, so that Berlin is balanced on a narrow diplomatic level. 
German wave: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it opposed the request for observer status of the Palestinian people would vote at the United Nations. 
Then there was Berlin. 
Why? 
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza. 
It is now time for Germany, because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be cautious. 
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position. 
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, too critical of Israel. 
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany has also abstained when it came to set up a no-fly zone. 
This was, after all, enforced by NATO. 
Germany, where it is difficult to take a clear position on major international issues? 
Yes, it is true. 
This is because it is surrounded by its foreign policy and away from a policy which has been gemanaged by the United States, towards a German foreign policy. 
To make matters worse, the Europeans do not have a coherent and consistent policy. 
The Germans are among the sides. 
It is expected of them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed. 
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the path to becoming a "normal" foreign policy. 
A foreign policy, such as France or Britain. 
What constitutes a "normal" foreign policy as concrete from a German perspective? 
It shows the willingness of national interests to take positions that are independent from those of the United States or European partners. 
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East. 
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent differently than those of the other major powers, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests. 
Have these economic interests to influence the stance on the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN? 
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states. 
This is why it must be careful that the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries not to offend. 
In any case, this is playing a role. 
But I would not want to attach a great deal of weight, which is not a completely one-sided relationship. 
But in any case it plays an important role in German considerations. 
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by important decisions to abstain in the vote on Palestine? 
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States, there is great sympathy for the German position. 
This is why I do not believe that this was a very dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue. 
Perhaps Germany will even have some respect for einspielen. 
Because it is a signal that it will be taken seriously as an international player, and its interests must be taken into account. 
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative. 
The United States has clearly expressed its support for a veto. 
Are there any differences between the United States and many European nations? 
In view of the US domestic policy, these differences still exist. 
I believe that the government of President Obama secretly has pretty much sympathy for the European position. 
But because of the political situation here, the government in public, of course, does not represent this position. 
I believe that the real differences are not as large as they always seem to be. 
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies. 
If Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other hand? 
I think that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans. 
Of course, it would be a bit easier for the Germans, if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case. 
So they cannot be part of a wider line and have instead things from their own position. 
This is exactly what we are doing with the euro. 
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position. 
That, of course, is not easy for Germany, because of its relationship with Israel. 
This has always been a sensitive issue. 
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they have to play a more independent role. 
If Germany itself in its role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a key role? 
Or is Germany, the leadership is still serious? 
Germany is still not used to, which is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role. 
If we look at the example of the euro crisis, because every time when Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German sentiments. 
That makes it not easy. 
This is actually the old problem: you are not surrounded by hostile countries. 
In this respect, Germany is in a much tougher position than the United States. 
It is sensitive to various neighbours and opinions and that is not easy. 
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU currently fills this void but not who is otherwise? 
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role. 
Even if they do not like it, they are uncomfortable, and makes them much less popular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: if Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese 
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well. 
But what is Armani Polo? 
There is an officially registered name across China, which does not have anything to do with the original companies. 
Yet it is so long as the real names do not complain. 
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right. 
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, the protection of rights abuses in the Far East. 
Every week, a new case ends up on my desk. 
The Nachahmers are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their names. 
It is simply out of Gucci Lu-Gucci, rather than Prada Prada-Kny. 
Similarly, German companies will be legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma. 
This opens up a file with information of the Community Trade Mark Office in Beijing. 
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name, which is also in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna. 
The fact that the Chinese champion in copying and injured intellectual property, is well known. 
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckig supermarkets, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting. 
Pocket cases are different: on behalf of his clients, however, that Chinese companies from the Trademarks Agency officially received the right to use a name, which already is protected elsewhere. 
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai," a passenger name. 
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan." 
This means that women who are wealthy men. 
The Chinese authorities are not aware 
"This is harmful, we must fight it," calls for stalemate. 
"The brand will be diluted, the damage is enormous." 
The financial losses and the legal costs of the affected industries are going into the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten. 
According to the market research company CLSA, China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing. 
But Löschungen dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money. 
Up to nine years, the process can drag on, with an uncertain outcome. 
Reports of cases in which complaints prompted the court, because after the long duration of the name of "market reality." 
If the plaintiff bad luck, he had the Plagiator even pay money because he violated its brand in China, says this hole. 
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle. 
Famous cases include graphic details. 
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the baumaschinen manufacturer Sany, the company, which was recently the German champion, pumpen took over. 
The Chinese must now use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star. 
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue white logo, which reminded us of BMW; the dispute has been resolved, Geely has had to change it. 
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile could look in the other direction. 
The Chinese authorities are not aware. 
The Trademarks Agency in Beijing CTMO is that 2010 due to reduced personnel and equipment shortages. 
Last year was one of the "emergency business returned to normal." 
The unbearbeiteter appeals procedure has fallen by 22%. 
Nearly 57 such cases have been completed, 75 per cent more than last year. 
However, there are still 81 500 objections to settlement. 
By contrast, it costs a lot 
As so often happens in China, the figures are impressive. 
In the past year, the CTMO is more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than 2010. 
This is a record and meant that China, for the tenth consecutive year the list of Neuanmeldungs around the world, shares with the authority. 
This also applies to the stock of all the valid trademark, a total 5.5 million piece. 
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees earned. 
Simplified, this means that each registering an average of 1280 yuan or costs 160 euros. 
On the other hand, it would cost many times, as in the case of the German family company the mountain shows. 
For more than seven years, the company has been battling a Chinese Plagiator. 
While the Germans were able to achieve its illegal manufacture the imitation of motor vehicle parts has been unearthed. 
But the followers pledged to keep the Chinese rights to the brand of joy. 
We have failed, because in Germany, family names could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of the Chemical speciali ties in Munich. 
The Trademarks Agency CTMO rejected the objection of Munich as well. 
In the next two bodies, the mountain is right, but the trial is still continuing. 
You have to watch your step 
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court. 
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts. 
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely expensive and is costing us much time, money and nerve." 
The internal costs could not quantify the company's archives have even a hundred years old files to prove them. 
Five years ago, the mountain on the other side in vain for a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle. 
"This shows how much it is worth," Wentzler says. 
The dangers in the Far East are even zurückzuschwappen in Europe. 
Then, when there are imitators unprotected brands. 
It was a Chinese manufacturer in Germany, known as the mountain of shoes and leather. 
This business has long since abandoned the company, but he was able to avert the registration. 
"You have to watch your step," Wentzler says. 
Both he and the lawyer advising German companies for doing business with China to be very careful. 
It is not enough to rely on international trade mark rights, but rather should foreigners ," everything is somehow worthy, even in China," Wentzler says. 
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration. 
In fact, if the mountains in the last act of his Markendramas, then we should do the opposite fees pay for your own name, Wentzler said. 
Or we will be forced out of the market in this segment. 
World Aids Day: Stampfen, sing, help 
In Heidelberg, probt the Imbongi choir - and in Swaziland are AIDS orphans. 
The story of a link, which is far more than 8733 kilometers. 
First there is the Stampfes: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, Damenpumps and Herrenslipper on the parquet floor, find it quickly. 
Four. 
Only then thresholds, the voices of the singers slowly - old, Bass, tenor and Sopran - press, betören and follow. 
And Fiete Hopf, the 29 year-old Dirigents, it almost stands out from his plastic footwear, when he is bringing together with his sleek wild gestures. 
It is Monday night in the music room of the Institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg, the chorus probt Imbongi a new song. 
The 50 sänger and singer came between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the householder. 
"Om" Obani " is not an easy piece, every vote has a different text and still in a very foreign language: Zulu, the 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland. 
Aid to self-help 
Worldwide, there are around 34 million people, the Unaids estimates that the programme of the United Nations on the Bekämfung of AIDS. 
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa. 
In Swaziland, live 245000 AIDS orphans. 
More than 40 per cent of the population are now HIV-positive. 
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the club Voices for Africa godfather found in Germany. 
More than 70 of them have a secondary school. 
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can assume a sponsor. 
It guarantees the child's school fees, school uniform and a warm meal every day in Gogo-Center. 
Imbongi is Zulu erzähler story, or even Lobpreiser. 
The bantu tongue fluid can no one in this room, but sing. 
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this alien soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: in southern Africa. 
8 733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir. 
Forty percent are infected 
Some 2 000 people live there, some still in simple Lehm and Strohhütten, a large part of them are children. 
More than 300 of them have no parents because they have succumbed to HIV. 
In Esitjeni shows in small, Swaziland suffers: the highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy in the world, according UNICEF. 
Cuts back to the male Vorhaut, the risk of contagion has been shown to reduce the half, are hardly accepted by the population. 
More than 40% of people in Swaziland have the immunschwäche virus to die in 30 is not uncommon. 
In the case of a joint African tour in the spring of 2005 was the chorus the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who not only lacked parental care, but simply to everyone: food, clothing, education. 
Without education, people in a poor country still have no chance. 
Initially, it was the personal involvement of individuals, for a few euros per year to send a child to school and give him a warm meal on the day. 
But a year later founded the chorus of the club "Voices for Africa," which has since been almost professionally cares about the AIDS waises in Esitjeni. 
Facts about sexually transmitted infections 
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases? 
Bacterial TSIs include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö). 
Frequent viral TSIs are HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis. 
Filzläuse and Krätze are among the parasitic TSIs. 
Who are the main stakeholders involved? 
Syphilis and Tripper are mainly in men who have sex with men. 
The Robert Institute estimates that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men. 
Among the heterosexual adults is that of chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (fungus), Tripper and humane Pappilomaviren often used sexually transmitted diseases. 
The spread of HIV is by heterosexual adults comparatively small - yet: around 20 per cent of the organised in this group. 
That of chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than in other communities. 
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years. 
Here, there are also humane Pappilomaviren among young people often. 
How has the number of infections developed? 
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable. 
The number of syphilis infections, according to the Robert Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled. 
The number of organised goes back since 2007. 
In 2011, there have been around 9 000 cases. 
This is about a tenth of less than a year earlier. 
What are the symptoms of venereal disease? 
The infectious diseases in genital ulcers can be besch in Urinieren, a product bauchschmerzen, as well as Bläschen or Warzen. 
Often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed. 
How can you protect yourself? 
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but offer no 100% protection. 
As part of the pathogen of sexually transmitted diseases, including Schmierinfektions and close physical contact. 
I therefore recommend that experts in particular often rotating Sexpartnern regular check-ups. 
Early diagnosis can most TSIs cured and will be avoided. 
By inconsistency, donations and not least the advantageous chorus in Germany, ersingt, is a great deal together. 
"Overall, we have already had some EUR 200 000 sent to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the club. 
In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and assertive woman from Germany. 
They are also concerned that the orphans are well, with one of the grandmothers, for example. 
The Gogos, known as the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village. 
Some of them have up to 14 orphans to give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day on time for school. 
Anyone who has no one comes to the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who is being paid by the club as well as the two Köchins every day for more than 200 hungry children. 
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a Nähschule, two chicken houses built and together with the American health organization PSI organized that many people in the village have a HIV-Test. 
This is not a foregone conclusion, because it appears the disease throughout the country, it is silent they prefer dead. 
A king with 14 wives 
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality." 
In fact, strange in a country where the king is officially 14 wives. 
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive lifestyle. 
Polygamy rather than democracy. 
Among other things, it is also the state contained lifestyle that HIV has spread so rapidly in recent decades. 
But many migrant workers, who carry the virus through the country. 
Free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz," but they are hardly used. 
Culture is another - flesh to flesh." 
In order for the cultural exchanges to promote something, the Imbongi-Chor travels every two or three years together through the South Africa and singing songs full of nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many in the south of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid. 
A bus full of white people singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition does not only mood and joy, but it has also been some grim border guards a few tears civil. 
The journey will always lead to Esitjeni, where the singers are visiting their godchildren. 
Even though the small village on maps is hardly in the valley of Ezulweni-Flusses, it is more than known. 
"If, after Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people who live there. 
And if the 8733 kilometre airline returns to Heidelberg, the stampfend Sängers in the test area on the Bergheimer road, then you can see it. 
More tests: NASA discovered ice on the Merkur 
The probe has evidence found that there are on the planet Merkur ice. 
The ice is probably up to 20 metres thick. 
The US-Raumfahrtbehörde NASA has the existence of ice on the planet Merkur. 
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, as three on Thursday in the specialist journal Science published studies show. 
The probe was evidence found that in the region of the planet constantly overshadowed by the ice. 
This is expected to at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 metres thick. 
The water probably came from comets, or possibly even Asteroiden, which are followed by the Merkur. 
No one is bringing the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon. 
The temperature on the Merkur can reach 426 degrees Celsius. 
The record, however, could help to resolve, such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.

Our insights into space: the main Teleskops 
The telescope is 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented - even before Galileo Galilei a year later to star observation. 
Since then, the mirror of optical Teleskops and more - and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper. 
30 years from 1947 to 1975, which was Hale-Teleskop in Palomar-Observatorium near San Diego, the largest in the world. 
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres. 
In Arizona, the United States, the Large Binocular cope. 
It leaves gaze into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres. 
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio recognise on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter. 
The mirror of the Southern African Large ' cope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs. 
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of around 11 metres. 
Part of the design, the telescope has locked us into, in his view - and thus limited in his mobility. 
Even the Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is in the picture. 
Its specificity: the high power. 
This is not enough - despite comparatively small diameter - in which the world's largest teleskope. 
With the help of a Radioteleskops in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) told investigators that all signs. 
The teleskop radio has a diameter of 305 metres.

This is the Very Large cope - worthy of his name. 
With a total of four does the cane can also ausleuchten the infrared spectrum. 
Also on the Chilean ESO-Observatorium, the European Extremely Large cope plan. 
Its main mirror is fed up with 42 metres - and nearly 1 000 mirror elements will be taken together. 
With pictures until at least 2018. 
By 2007 the two keck teleskope in the hawaii diminishes volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world. 
They offer the same two mirrors with an average of 10 metres. 
The keck teleskope are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatoriums, along with them with the Subaru-Teleskop and the IRTTF in the sky. 
Even at the Mauna Kea is supposed to create a new giant telescope - with a durchschnitt from 30 metres. 
In this regard, it is an illustration to marvel at. 
The main impressions from the space, the Space teleskop Hubble discovered. 
Since 24 April 1990, it is already pictures of distant worlds. 
Since March 2009, the Kepler space teleskop for extrasolaren planets - mainly for those who are habitable. 
On 2 February 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates since the beginning of the mission have been detected. 
In the picture, the final preparations for launch of the space teleskop Kepler documented. 
The James Webb Space cope (JWST) will be until at least 2018 aboard a Ariane5-Rakete shot into space. 
The primary level of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 metres. 
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is in the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang. 
Scientists assume that even at the South Pole of Merkur ice exists. 
However, there is no reliable data for this, because the measurement is far closer to the North Pole hover around the planet. 
Radar measurements have been around for decades suggest that there is ice on the Merkur. 
The 2004 launched messenger probe - the first to hover around the Merkur - the scientists have now certainty.

In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblical age.

A search in the country in which 97 people are still comparatively young. 
The journey through the Talysch-Gebirge is romantic. 
The Kleinbus rumpelt on the road over densely wooded hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses. 
Everything is green and juicy, you might think that you would have been in the Black Forest. 
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few miles away. 
This is the Caucasian population of Talyschen, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfect Persian, as well as Aserisch and is very durable. 
Destination is Lerik. 
The small city flaunts powerful architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape. 
Tourists from Europe hardly come here is too onerous for the journey from Azerbaijan capital, Baku. 
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only a single track. 
The fabulous wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived in the province. 
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik is the stuff of tourist attraction. 
"Baku was in May with the eurovision song festival famous - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says. 
She is the director of the museum for longevity, is probably the only one in the world. 
Here is the Vita of approximately eight dozen Talyschen from the area documented more than 100 Fatulayeva shows on a black-and-white photo. 
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old. 
In the age of 136 years, a child conceived 
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, 168 years old. 
A birth certificate, however, does not exist. 
And in view of the oldest documented man, who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age seems extremely doubtful. 
"1805 here he was born in the region, and in 1973 he died," Fatulayeva explained. 
The man has been married three times and have 23 children, at the age of 136 years ago, he is still a daughter. 
Has irali Müslümov in his age for a few decades? 
But Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max-Planck-Institut in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly - in Central Asia. 
"What is striking, there are also many hochaltrige people in some areas of China, in Japan or in Hunza-Tal in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men." 
In the absence of documentation, however, is not a scientific proof of the age, particularly because civil records were missing. 
Every day becher melted butter 
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik is remarkably often a biblical age. 
At present there are 20 people who are older than 100 years old. 
So why are so many Hochbetagte in the south? 
The Azeri leader Farid Mugimzadeh said that with the particular genes of the Talyschen. 
Museum director Fatulayeva, however, believes that it is up to the diet. 
But the high-calorie diet of Talyschen is to be healthy, meat, bread and, above all, love dairy products, and many of them every day and drink a glass melted butter, seems to be dietary not plausible. 
Or is it the original lifestyle, which keeps the people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva. 
In its 97 years for these regions it is still comparatively young. 
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the entire Caucasus region. 
It sits on the ground with a butter barrels before they tirelessly and herrollt. 
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents. 
Even two toddlers jump around. 
The kitchen is preparing the tea, which will be served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu-Gläsern. 
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in form and link, under her headscarf, her long, dark blond remained, her son proudly unveiled before us. 
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they were never told me and kept their colour. 
"Shampoo I have never been used," Mirzayeva says. 
Monthly pension is enough for life 
She has always eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas. 
My entire life I have not once bought in the supermarket food. 
Then they were told by her husband in the army. 
It was the worst in the period after the Second World War. 
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew, took the helm. 
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman. 
But the cult, which is being driven by the father figure of the nation, which his country ruled as a dictator, knows little borders in Azerbaijan. 
Until 2003 he was in power, who later took his son Ilham the helm. 
After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan elderly people. 
230 Manat (roughly the same amount in euros), will receive Mirzayeva monthly pension, for a sum here, of which you can live well. 
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long grey son right: "Old people enjoy respect in our culture." 
They live in the middle of the big family, to be loved, cared and are happy. 
If this is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive 
The word "human rights" is lacking in the Constitution. 
The revolution has returned to Cairo. 
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country. 
The future constitution with Sharia law as a basis is controversial. 
The Egyptian president's signature is not with emotion. 
We need to make the transition. 
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and God," he said on state television. 
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but probably mainly to the Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims and Säkularen. 
Because they all have been hopelessly divided into a confused opposition, are afraid. 
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by mercies of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. 
He said Mohammed Mursi almost compromise temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers, "in order to save the revolution." 
But what of the 61 year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save the Egyptians, the world is not quite aware. 
Should the judiciary be ousted? 
In fact, the 234 articles of the Islamist-dominated 100 000-strong gebends assembly in a late-night, Parforceritt 15 hours were pushed through, in part, worrying. 
As in previous constitutions, it is also in the draft law based on the "principles Islamic law." 
But what is called "principles"? 
It was and is open to interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists, the ambiguous wording and the associated legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law will be used. 
This is at least a new article suggests: Sharia law in all matters relating to the Al-Ashar-Universität must be drawn, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great clout in the entire Sunni Islam. 
This is not, but it may mean that the clerics oversee the legislation, which de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary would entail. 
Much of the Verfassunsgsentwurf interpretation is 
Also problematic: the civilian military justice system is to continue to be maintained. 
These courts have been used during Mubarak's rule for the suppression of opposition brought. 
After the fall of the dictator who sat down to 11 000 civilians in military detention. 
The state should also, as it says in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their morality and their values." 
It is legal so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even could control the content of cinema and literature. 
In plain language, this is nothing more than censorship. 
No article, moreover, explicitly stipulates the equality of men and women. 
It prohibits the prophet Muhammad and his envoys to insult or slander. 
But what is an insult, and how it is to be punished, remains unclear. 
Equally dubious is the wording of "insulting people" should be banned. 
If there has been a caricature of the president or a joke at cost of a jurist? 
Interpretation, like so much in the draft, the Mursi for his signature before and after his words "very soon," the Egyptians will be presented to the referendum. 
"The revolution has returned." 
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the power of the Islamists. 
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to bring the charter even before it can enter into force. 
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third platzierter of the presidential election. 
Nobel Peace Prize winner and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei, said that the draft constitution was "on the scrapheap of history." 
Via intelligence service Twitter he accused Mursis supporters, a "coup against democracy" to take. 
"If he has declared the referendum, we will go to his palace and put him down," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said. 
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Khaled Ali. 
And several judges announced that the referendum failed to monitor want, which means it would be invalid. 
"The Koran is our Constitution." 
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood inflated, for their part in the counter-demonstration, precaution, but not at the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer at the other Nilufer in front of Cairo University. 
Many veiled women and supporters of Salafisten attended and said: "The people are calling for the application of God's law." 
They called Mursi: "Säubere the country!" and beteuerten: "The Koran is our constitution." 
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would probably be the war-like situation. 
The Mursis supporters were obviously not at risk. 
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters have spoken loud and clear. 
Now it is time that the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go. 
A majority vote for the draft of the Islamists is considered safe. 
"The word 'human rights is not even before' 
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have until February and should involve all social forces. 
The 48 year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned under Mubarak or were in court. 
It is not because he would share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible. 
For that he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned. 
"And now, the word" human rights are not even in the new constitution, "he complained in conversation with the" world on Sunday. " 
Mursi power expansion in all three branches of the state could be resigned to the lawyer. 
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship. 
"Rather than to strengthen civil society, the President de facto repealed," complained Saeda. 
But without civil society organisations could not function like a democracy. 
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which the ideological struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement. 
This could backfire. 
One demonstrator at the Tahrir warns: "Your gebährt is a monster that you can no longer control." 
Rakfisk from Norway: is that the übelriechendste fish in the world? 
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest living standards - and not only in Europe, but around the world. 
Could the success secrets of the country with the local appetite for pretty smelly fish? 
Take a selection of mature cheese varieties. 
They platziere in the midst of a bunch of dirty sports clothing. 
And they leave that there is a week. 
For example, one must imagine the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the major such delicacies of Norway. 
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo. 
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which is simply not going to disappear. 
Rakfisk is with salt bestreut trout, which - depending on how his stinking fish would like - up to a year in water will be fermented. 
If the darkness in Norway over the country, and the weather will be colder, Norwegians on a celebration here in Fagernes, this is really a very alluring specialty. 
"You eat it raw and carries it with a glass of aquavit anymore," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General" also organized the festival. 
In order to have people eat small fish cube and take large quantities of alcohol. 
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," Havard says. 
The label can crowd out the smell. 
I cost some pausing. 
If it avoids the Rakfisk in its nose, it is not a bad thing - such as sushi, which is a very long trip. 
Rakfisk is the product of a different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no refrigeration facilities and fish in the autumn in dense salt water barrels was wet. 
In the deepest winter then he was removed after a long fermentation and, no doubt tempered by using alcohol consumed. 
Even before a generation saw thousands of Norwegians in the search for work forced to leave their country and emigrate from mainly to the United States. 
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care system. 
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who not long ago was much richer than Norway, immigrants. 
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly part of Norwegian history. 
He is among the more expensive dishes that you can buy here. 
But in fact this is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich that costs 10 euros. 
Norway is not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that. 
Here we hate it still, in contrast to Breivik naming and shaming - those racist right-wing extremist, last year 77 men, women and children shot. 
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of 22 July." 
Norwegians are struggling to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is able to such brutal killings. 
The main responsibility for the current wealth of Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien of the world. 
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waiter, who distributed some tablets with mature Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and the gut-wrenching blue eyes, embodies the Nordic ideal. 
We are, as we say, prudent people. 
Your English is just as most people here are impeccable. 
We are not very angeberisch, we may not be boasting. 
Norway is very cautious in dealing with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry profits will be for the benefit of future generations invested in a special fund. 
When, in the years leading up to the global economic crisis with money that they do not have kept Norway closed its wallet. 
"As long as we ski in winter and summer, we are happy," says Anna. 
"And, of course, Rakfisk dinner," she adds with a smile. 
I am standing in the snow and put me in a different court - I have had enough of Rakfisk. 
For example, a moose burger is in any case something else, and the hefty meat. 
But the evening is once again Stinkefisch on the menu. 
The hotel, in which I logiere, is one of several sorts who organise a Rakfisk-Dinner in which guests for the best - or perhaps the good smell the most challenging - fish can vote. 
There is a Live-TV-Schaltung on a fly clad show master, who is surrounded by tables with Rakfisk. 
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest. 
"What have you up there in the mountains for the best fish, thor jürgen?" 
"These are our points, Havard." 
Applause and laughs. 
A man who falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the aquavit. 
But perhaps it is the strict cloud of the whole fish. 
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start 
While Mexico President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his arrival, Will Grant from the BBC the forthcoming challenges and the mixed feelings of its people. 
At present, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad. 
Even in better days, this is a always congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel erected several important transport routes in the capital, absperrt, and on the streets for chaos. 
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on the way to work, but also to prevent protesters reaching Parliament. 
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto, the presidential binde and the leadership of the nation. 
He faces a complex task. 
Under the outgoing government, Felipe Calderon's economic Mexico has been able to work well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war, which in the last six years has cost 60 000 lives. 
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US President Barack Obama. 
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal. 
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, was Pena Nieto as governor of his home State of Mexico. 
In this densely populated, vast part of the country, which surrounds the capital, are the different views on the new head of state. 
A direct man 
In the remote town del Valle bravo, for example, is remembered fondly of him. 
Residents of the tourist location write to him, the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure. 
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways, Pena Nieto and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which it once was. 
Badges with his name are also outside of a modern sports centre and a powerful interactive museum on climate change. 
"We expect real and lasting changes," his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI is working. 
In particular, as regards the security and economy, we look forward to an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs. 
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000, replaced by Vicente Fox. 
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto. 
The accusations made by the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects. 
He is a very direct man, very committed and have great plans for the country. 
He was a great statesman, above all, but he is also someone who can listen to me. 
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view about their former governor. 
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, could contrast to the paved streets of Valle del bravo not be greater. 
The place is hidden under motorway führungen and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself. 
And the problems in the municipality are of crucial urban nature. 
At the beginning of this year, the military intervened to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem. 
In a spot fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill, in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens murdered women left behind. 
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, killed more than 1 000 women in Mexico state - a statistic that even the city Ciudad Juarez, which for its violence and the killings of innocent women is notorious. 
The Pena Nietos critics are of the view that he is the problem of feminicide during his term at least, is not adequately addressed. 
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem. 
In a Betonbau, typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia is wrestling with the tears when she photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows. 
The official version of events, according to Mariana 2010, has committed suicide. 
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner. 
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," remembers Senora Buendia. 
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body had already been deployed. 
While her mother tells her story, gazing from the wall a picture of Mariana down to us, but it is appropriate, in addition to a cross, which bears a single word: justice. 
But this is precisely what the family have been denied until now. 
The authorities have treated me when I was a Schwätzerin, Nörglerin. 
They want their judgment simply accepted and shut up. 
"But it is not possible if there were so many flaws and omissions," she says. 
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday receives the presidential binde so that he is also assuming a great responsibility. 
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been in the last six years of violent crimes, and the new president has promised, during his tenure, particularly in order to deal with this problem. 
"I hope he is as president, as he as governor was," says the PRI-Kongressabgeordnete Olvera in Valle del bravo. 
But is afraid the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most. 
The prosecutor alleges that Bradley Manning did not abuse besch 
The prosecutor Bradley contradicts Mannings allegations that he had been mistreated in prison 
The hearing deals with Mannings in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia 
The defense seeks dismissal of the indictment due to harsh prison conditions 
According to the US Army Corporal is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents to 
On Friday, the prosecutor has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - indicted for the biggest disclosure of confidential information in the US history, missed several opportunities to complain about allegedly suffered mistreatment in military detention. 
In a cross-examination Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein, that documents on weekly visits to the prison officers during Mannings nine-month prison in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment. 
A day before the cross-examination, the result of a request by the defence for the dismissal of the indictment was held - by the harsh prison time Manning had already been punished enough, Manning had testified that he would have been considered in prison suicides. 
According to the US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of during his time in Iraq thousands of confidential documents were stolen. 
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet. 
WikiLeaks Manning as a source of information has never been confirmed. 
In the hearing on Friday with Manning went through the forms, the officials after their meetings with Manning had been filled out during his detention in Quantico-Militärgefängnis, where he from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions had been satisfied. 
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers to. 
When Fein on Friday quizzed him on the forms, Manning admitted that the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional." 
The forms contained no complaints about abuse, even though the Manning officials had directly asked about his treatment. 
Manning said that he had verbally expressed his concerns and that the officials had discussed with him and to deal with them, but they have not been recorded. 
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns)," no problems ," and not necessarily meant that I said nothing at all," Manning said. 
The judge, Col. Denise Lindh, Manning also asked why he did not besch about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, a few months earlier on a form mentioned suicide should investigate. 
Manning said his intention during this meeting have been his status for the "prevention of injury" downgrading. 
The military said that it was him that restrictive status - a level below the suicide risk, and the protection of others. 
"I wanted to convince people that it was a good thing, and get rid of the observer status for the prevention of violations (...) to achieve a higher quality from my perspective, to achieve," said Manning. 
Manning said Thursday on his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months was detained before he in July 2010 in the prison of the Quantico naval base in Virginia. 
He said that in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become unconscious due to the heat again. 
Not knowing what with him or in the outside world, was costly. 
"My world fell on Camp Arafjon, in the same cage," Manning said on Thursday. 
I thought I would die in this cage. 
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning had the bulk of his time spent in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society. 
It gave him only a mattress, a blanket, Flip-Flops, clothes and his glasses. 
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or only. 
He was always forced to sleep with the light from the outside in his cell. 
If he had turned back at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was buoyant, so that he is back. 
In January 2011, Mannings lawyers formally objected to the Mannings. 
In April 2011, Manning in the military prison of Fort leave worth Kansas. 
On Friday, the judge quizzed Manning also on a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday - he had a night to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico and naked in a morning count before guards and other prisoners. 
Manning had testified that he had during this count never had the opportunity to umhüllen with his blanket. 
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he had ordered his guards closed the ceiling, with which he could have, but he admitted that he had not called upon to do so. 
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to do so in the previous night to sleep naked; he had previously tried to show an official that he is not a threat to himself. 
Manning said the official, he would have the backing of his underwear or his Flip-Flops can use to injure himself, but this is not done. 
On this night, Manning said, his underwear, Flip-Flops and glasses have been removed from his cell. 
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his detention and will drastically reduce his prison sentence, he should be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for the beginning of next year. 
The defense has indicated that Manning committed minor offences guilty, while other charges, which are regarded as too extreme to be challenged. 
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor is expected to have a justification of the detention conditions. 
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the rules, which apply to all prisoners incarcerated under the highest safety precautions in Quantico. 
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, illegal publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the theft of public property or documents. 
If he in all charges was found guilty, he faces a life sentence. 
I am between Mexico and amerikanische identity crisis. 
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities being forced to leave Mexico 
Mexicans tend to blame the immigrants - they call them hard times to remember, he says 
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans between two worlds are caught 
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just traversed the Hall and had arrived at the passport control, as confusion was widespread in me. 
Placards referred to two lines: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners"). 
I was there a few seconds long, uncertain about which I should come. 
I grew up in central California, and was my entire life called "Mexicans." 
An ethnic acronym - as well as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York call "Italians." 
Later, I decided to "between Mexico and America." 
But Mexico was here. 
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for Kürzels or slashed. 
I was just Americans. 
I am speaking Spanish, or at least good enough to me in this language at both ends of an interview. 
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am not going on. 
So I took up my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros. 
I thought about the moment after this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama. 
On the agenda of all those issues, which we expected when the heads of these two countries: immigration, drugs and trade. 
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, but it is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States. 
He wants to form an alliance with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc, according to a model of the European Union. 
And Pena Nieto vowed that Mexico's war against the drug cartels, even though he gave no details in this regard. 
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment. 
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought that the United States invaded in Mexico in 1848, and the leadership of the country under a gun forced more than half of its territory. 
But for Mexicans, who in centuries, not in minutes, are memories of this event cannot be overlooked. 
As soon as a US official only mildest criticism in Mexico, we are told, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - will be besch about how the Americans press the sovereignty of their neighbour. 
And monte zumas are moving on the path of war. 
Yet it is the biggest challenge facing Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States. 
Inclination to talk about resentment? 
There are more than enough. 
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country opens, and others, for whom it does not do this. 
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point in our tree a person - perhaps a parent or parent - no chance in Mexico and got in on the road north. 
And in most cases, this person had a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so on. 
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is important to them. 
It is not Mexico. 
Although we may now live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican. 
Our identity is sometimes perhaps blurred, but what our loyalty, this is not the case. 
This clearly applies to the United States. 
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican ruling class may not be. 
This is based on reciprocity. 
You can see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look to us because we are not Mexican enough. 
Our Spanish is never good enough, our ties with Mexico have never been strong enough. 
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of the failure. 
If not our families in Mexico have failed, they would not have gone. 
And then we are not behind the silk curtains - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost. 
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States, einwanderte reminded me that tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea about who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking this seriously. 
While US citizen, sees it as part of two countries. 
But many Mexican Americans, who I know, have the feeling that neither to be part of the other country. 
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen. 
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but it is rooted in any one of them. 
In Mexico, we are going to be seen as an American. 
And in the United States, we are going to be seen as Mexicans. 
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the chattering classes would resume their ties to the diaspora. 
They want to see Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States. 
We are supposed to tell our American colleague about how great a visit to this country and put pressure on the political leadership to step up its ties with Mexico. 
Now. 
This will not happen. 
Too many injured. 
And in view of the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country. 
I am afraid, as you alone, cronies. 
This is fair. 
If at least some Mexicans are still not ready, the United States for dealing with Mexico in a century and a half, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a grievance for how their family members have been treated not so long ago. 
Hmmm. 
Maybe we are "of Mexican" than I thought. 
The old, new in the Middle East 
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for the peace process 
Can it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East? 
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud. 
Amid the usual recriminations, countless buildings in rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time rockets from Gaza in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem. 
But even though the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historic conflict, appear to be changing the Middle East around them. 
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want to or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil. 
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed. 
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff could finally reach its end. 
A war that is neither lost nor won 
At first glance, it seems optimistic in view of the current situation is anything but appropriate. 
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week's clashes have strengthened the Hartgesottenes on both sides. 
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip, will claim that the Israelis have diminished, even though his group itself has seen huge losses. 
Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolat and dense bevölkert corners of the planet will be packed, Israel has so far not been able to destroy Hamas. 
In fact, Hamas in the West Bank, which the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah will be controlled. 
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side. 
For example, as Islamists have gained in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and rich friends on their side. 
Turkey, a resurgent regional power, which was once seen as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states. 
Jubelnde Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly more Islamist Stürzung Bashar's could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king. 
And in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the world's largest and most important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region. 
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his ouster in 2011 30 years, had little time left for Hamas. 
By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and its leaders more dependent on public opinions. 
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded. 
The Israeli hardliners, however, make an opposite conclusion. 
Militarily speaking, Hamas is not a threat. 
The Israeli missile defence system, the "Iron Dome," has been able to prove its worth, and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed. 
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more easily. 
In diplomatic terms the United States remain steadfast in its position, but many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest Gewalteskalationen. 
Israel is well handed down in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process largely ignored. 
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip since 2004 have killed around 30 Israelis, the country is relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the security wall has, in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared unconstitutional, but always be further developed. 
Netanyahu is good, and his Likud Party has been in the runup to the elections on 22 January, with Avigdor Lieberman allied with a kämpferisch group. 
Why is this insidious nanny Palestinians and give them a separate state? 
If they really control over the West Bank, then they would not be just as their supporters in the Gaza Strip, including the firing rockets? 
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish, they should not dare to raise their heads. 
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but the Arab Spring could make a line through the bill. 
Even if the Islamists, who are now in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the problems in their own country. 
The Israeli defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together. 
A war with the local superpower, the new Arab governments will hardly help to rebuild their economy. 
The fact that the pragmatic President Barack Obama oust with Mursi, in order to reach a ceasefire, could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era. 
Even the Israelis should think long-term. 
While the rest of the Arab world tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day will explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv. 
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation. 
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip over the years, increasing its diplomatic toll. 
Both sides need a boost from the outside world 
The right answer is those of the sensible representatives of both sides, the bulk of the outside world and will be represented by this newspaper: two states, in which Israel surrenders areas for security purposes. 
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders have more influence on the implementation of this solution. 
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by regional exchanges and a united Jerusalem, to convince. 
Outsiders Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement. 
It would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for un-beobachter status. 
Obama must also do its part to push Israel into negotiations. 
During his first term, he failed the idea of his own peace plan. 
Far in the White House, it seems as if he were just as opposed to a participation. 
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective. 
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East. 
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. 
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging in force 
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packets, which are the same for all tobacco brands 
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging are in force in Australia, in order to brand logos and colors will be replaced by neutral, oliv green lid, which are also printed with graphic images, which sick body parts and by cigarette smoke sick infants and children. 
Among the various health warnings and pictures, apart from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs of the brand names, which are printed in identical, small letters. 
This means that Australia is the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging. 
The Australian Federal Government wants to see young people smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco use will be eliminated. 
It is the government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, with 99% probability will no longer start. 
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to compete with their brand image," Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, quotes studies, for example, have shown that children are the crown of a logo associated with the idea of a princess. 
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little effect on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar measures. 
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law. 
For example, it was said that the legislation would encourage the black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes. 
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco. 
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia. 
Others, however, say that the rules have boosted their business. 
Sandra ha of Zico Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone cap to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian Court failed with its appeal against the law. 
Zico have up to 6 000 units sold in wholesale shops and waiting for new stocks. 
For us, this is a good business. 
Experts say that is the flaw in the popularity of social media in precisely the population group, in which the plan. 
A number australischer laws, tobacco companies banned from the TV-Werbung, it forbids them to act as a sports sponsors, and the vast majority of traders being forced to sell cigarettes in shops no longer to be interpreted, and now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet. 
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sides, but has no influence on the international side. 
"Who left tobacco marketed and only a small area, in order to advertise its products, is not on the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney. 
In the social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook gave Freeman an increase of feedback on brands identified by "ordinary people." 
It is the question: is it just a private individual who so much likes marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it? 
British American Tobacco says that the industry, rather than concentrating on marketing to deal with the new laws. 
It has even gone so far, Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to pay to challenge the new rules, those countries complain about unfair trade practices at the World Trade Organization, even though none of the countries increased trade with Australia. 
A WTO ruling is expected in 2013. 
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries which are considering similar legislation. 
Canada was the first country to mandating photographic warnings. 
In the meantime they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine. 
Tougher laws are being contemplated in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India. 
Many Australian smokers are defiant. 
The images do not affect me. 
I simply ignore them. 
"It is simply a bad way, and the box is away," says Victor El Hage with the purchase of a cigarette packet on which a photograph is printed with a mouth tumor. 
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl. 
James Yu, manager of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the inner city of Sydney, says that the single packaging was stacking his shelves more difficult. 
"In the past, I have spent an hour with a einzusortieren delivery, and now I do not need four," says Yu. 
"The government should have cigarettes simply completely ban - then we would have said okay, that's it, we are close," he adds visibly angry. 
In a constant air world, it is nice to be bored 
This thank giving, I spent five hours at the airport, when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight. 
I had enough time to give me a few thoughts on boredom. 
I do not want to lie. 
A half a day at the airport waiting for a flight, is quite nervous killing - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, duty-free shopping) are available. 
But more and more academics and child development experts have boredom as something positive. 
If it goes to them, it is for us - and our children - OK, sometimes bored. 
This means that the brain is forced to lose in interesting ideas, which may promote the creativity. 
And because most of us today are almost always on the one or the other screen, the benefits of boredom is no longer available. 
We should therefore welcome the boredom with open arms? 
Yes. 
And no. 
This is what I would like to come back. 
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed with increasing leisure time. 
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), this is not the case. 
"In fact, boredom is a very long history," he says. 
The Pompejis signs a Latin inscriptions about boredom, which originates in the first century. 
Then there is the question as to how we boredom actually define. 
John D. East wood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada says that the problem is that boredom in many ways defined and discussed. 
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor East wood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory job to do, but not to be able to define what it is." 
Boredom is different from apathy to the effect that the person is not employed, but he wants to. 
In the case of apathy, however, there is no desire to do anything. 
The experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the interest process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly." 
Boredom can listen almost as much as depression. 
But Professor East wood believes, even though these two conditions could see bored people the problem in their area or the world, while the problem people see in themselves. 
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even though we have very difficult to concentrate. 
In their study, "the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - German, for example: "The idle minds: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor East wood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazin article. 
Some groups have heard a loud television channel from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content; others heard it on low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear this noise at all. 
The people who were barely audible television, saying they were more boring than the two other groups - they have had problems to focus, for no reason and wrote their difficulties of boredom. 
If you try to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study. 
If, however, a dull professional activity, "such as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor can distract music and help not bored." 
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, they can fight even by people who are physically more alert. 
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit," Professor Fenske. 
We are all at some point boring - my delayed flight, a sensational loudspeaker, a particularly tedious film. 
But some people bore more easily than others. 
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale of boredom." 
On the scale, there are statements such as "many things that I must do is repeat and monotonous" and "I have so many interests, that I was not enough time for all." 
With the help of such scales researchers have found that boys are more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West florida, especially as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli. 
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter bunch. 
In 1991, Reed Larsen who, professor of human and gemeinwesen development at the University of Illinois, through an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a Pager kontaktierte. 
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and let the house were bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school. 
But only 3% of parents said they bored. 
Professor Larsen who says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom has risen or fallen. 
But he is sure that "youth is seen as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major impact on their daily routine. 
Back then, on my original question: is boredom healthy? 
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads people to take extreme physical risks and gambling or drugs to alleviate them, the studies have shown. 
On the other hand look at many philosophers and authors of the relationship between boredom and creativity, and this view is Professor Vodanovich, who studied for more than two decades. 
"With the boredom, the brain is to say that you should do something else," Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York. 
But the brain does not always know what you should do best. 
If one is boring and the energy used to play and cook Gitarre, will be happy. 
But television can make short-term sense, they vanish over the long term but again. 
If his bored child is an iPad enough, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to maintain itself or to control, says Professor Fenske. 
And he adds: "Self-regulation is transferring from a situation to the other." 
The child learns not only to entertain, but it also receives more self-regulation in other areas. 
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom. 
Similarly, we should not be critical. 
Instead, our aim should be to get away from the constant Aktivitäts and berieselung at ease. 
Professor East wood agrees. 
"It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says. 
He believes that people really just want to find a way to switch off and relax. 
"In an environment in which we are constantly stimulated, it is difficult to deal with when the noise is silent." 
In Colorado there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law 
The 19 year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which in this state will soon be legal: the possession of a few marijuana stones and a pipe with which he rauchte. 
According to Orozco, he and some friends in a Septembertag car in Lamar near the border with Kansas en route, when they were stopped. 
After the police officer marijuana was found in the car, Orozco was summoned to the possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien - kavalier offences, each with a penalty of 100 Dollar - and received a court hearing. 
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco. 
But he is also one? 
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends less on the law in hundreds of minor drug offences, and the site. 
Hundreds of regulatory offence for marijuana, here and in Washington state approved similar measures that have already been dropped. 
The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years ago is no longer in possession in small measure, which is allowed by law, once the new laws in force in the next few weeks. 
But prosecutors in the even more conservative districts of Colorado have announced to follow up on existing marijuana offences and who are still living in court. 
At the same time voting in several cities, from the Denvers suburbs to the Western Mountain, new state licensed marijuana shops to stop at the opening in their communities. 
"This situation continues to evolve so quickly that I do not know what will happen as the next," says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is east of Denver. 
And regulators in Washington state are perplexed at the head. 
They are waiting for guidance on the establishment of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have set a deadline until 1 December 2013. 
In Washington, it is of the view that Colorado, in any case, most states, and the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only for medical purposes, and then for private consumption. 
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and the state is therefore good for guidance," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the regulatory authority for spirits in Washington state. 
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide. 
"We have no real precedent which we can follow," he adds. 
The Washington law, called I-502, is on 6 December in force and is also the end of a grey zone in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but the possession is legalised. 
And unpleasant practical issues must be resolved at this time, for example, as the state requirement of "adequate access" to lizenziertem marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis in the radius of 300 metres of schools, parks, jobs and child care facilities should be agreed upon. 
"Nowhere is it more difficult to find a location for a lizenziertes cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the densely populated area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis," a recently formed research group. 
On 21 November sent Chief Oates an Email to his staff in Aurora, in which he said that the prosecutor would minor marijuana trafficking in people over 21 years ago is no longer, and that the police "immediately" no criminal charges will be sought for these offences. 
Chief Oates added that the police continue to urban targets to regulate growers of medical marijuana will be enforced and drug traffickers continue to be prosecuted. 
In Weld County in the north of Colorado, District Attorney General Ken buck a stricter view. 
After the vote, he gave his authority would continue to monitor of marijuana possession, mainly to get consumers to the withdrawal. 
Currently, 119 people for possession of around 50 grams or less marijuana on trial, even though many have been charged for other crimes. 
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations, in which it was committed to the tatzeit," the buck has said in a statement. 
The reactions are, even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, is ambivalent. 
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, shows an adult in the possession of small quantities no longer. 
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided to do so, not all outstanding proceedings to be dropped. 
"I do not believe that I don't waste my time in order to enforce the law until it is changed," he says. 
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure that was already clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana to reconcile with the complexities of government and legal system. 
And the contradictory reactions across the state encouraged among local officials a profound dilemma in terms of the great green experiment to date. 
District prosecutors if it is a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, the defendants for marijuana offences in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the National Organization for reform of marijuana laws. 
"They have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute that they still cannot accept," he believes. 
As the first states, smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, are going to deal with Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs. 
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age legal sale, they are also nervous on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a criminal offence. 
Advocates of legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give. 
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug users and sellers medical Marihuanas, the federal government on the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part. 
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drogenpolitik adviser to the Obama administration is of the view that police officers will probably not happen behind closed doors, in order to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but are likely to be under the new legislation to allow legal, government regulated marijuana operations. 
Several towns in Colorado did not even wait for the federal authorities. 
Even before the election day passed some local municipalities moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though they could open up in about a year. 
Last week, rose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will be adopted probably next week. 
"We do not want to get into a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," Bob Nicholson, a member of the council. 
Our community voted against this change. 
We are depending on what the community has opted for, and not afterwards, for what the state has decided. 
There are many questions unanswered. 
Of petrodollars ella Wyatt: I was from Oxford because I Tory am 
Not only university students today are attacked for their views 
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at the University of Oxford. 
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university, which I once regarded as the greatest mark in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - promoted. 
But within two weeks after my arrival at the Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - where I had intended to study history - I had packed my bags and brought about the first scandal of my life. 
My father broke into tears. 
My friends were confused. 
The Evening Standard said that I would have gone because I had a problem with that discover had sex in the adjoining room. 
The writer A N Wilson highlighted said that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged crockery. 
The truth, however, was less amusing. 
I walked away. 
Yes, it was because I was suffering from systematic harassment and threats. 
It is not because of my very unaccustomed name, or because I came from a private school. 
It was just me being harassed for a reason - a reason in this supposed cradle of enlightenment seemed so parochial and cruel: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher's and supporter of the Conservative Party. 
Why do I mention this now? 
Now, according to the latest reports, a new generation of students from the moderate right under similar persecution. 
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same equality protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities. 
Conservative members of the younger Common Room (JRC) of the Corpus Christi College, they will be on the basis of their political views "are often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable." 
They are calling for a seat on the equality committee of the College, in order to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed. 
Making matters worse, their situation through a recent broadcast documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis. 
It has been shown, among other graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association of Oxford University, who was in a Rolls-Royce whose and flaunted silberfarbenem suit and silberbesetztem Gehstock. 
At other universities say conservative students, they are seen as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees." 
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the conservative student group of the University of Nottingham, announced in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftward trend in universities. 
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever experienced." 
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant." The 19 year old Stephanie Cherill, incoming president of the conservative student association of Oxford says that she had JCR-Mitgliedern a growing opposition to the moderate right students watched. 
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and to the wellbeing of the people," she says. 
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I was one such a minority. 
As an incredibly shy 18 year-old person I had arrived in September 1986. 
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax. 
In the last year, the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to give an honorary title. 
The atmosphere could even shake Stalinisten. 
In the first few days of the first-year week, in which new students and Tutors learning, I received a foretaste of the future events. 
I made the experience that the Tutors mockery of Tory students is not only tolerated, but also happily attended it. 
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa, they found their way into the holzgetäfelt rooms of the Tutoriums. 
In my first these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English, in what was then, I had not been taken. 
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph." 
I stumbled on this. 
Pitt was a small man with a face like pastry, and pretty nasty. 
"If Thatcher fans learn French, or they are simply stupid?" he asked me. 
The other kicherten. 
In my eyes, wallten tears. 
"I propose that in your free time a few hours of French - that is, if you are not too preoccupied with their social activities," knurrte Pitt. 
I returned to hanging his head in my room. 
On this evening, I sat in college alone at the dinner when someone slightly tippte on the back. 
It was an English student from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association. 
"I know who you are," he said. 
Unfortunately, it is what it is. 
Anyone who is suspected to be Tory, will be harassed. 
For me, it is bad enough, but they know that your father is Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you. 
Most Tory erstsemester, supporters of the Labour Party. 
In a local Pub, I later tried to stand with me. 
I insisted that I did not fully agree with Mrs Thatcher. 
This trick should prove fruitless. 
A student in philosophy, politics and economics, ironically, the conservative Eton College, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist schweins." 
You are polluted. 
Other students shared his opinion. 
I was perverse and dirty. 
"How Tories have sex?" asked me one. 
The beat each other, or? 
I felt so as homosexuals in the more liberal legislation in the United States had to have felt. 
Would I ever be able to attend the Oxford University to lead a normal life? 
If I were like-minded only after onset of darkness? 
If I turn to the Labour Party, and my natural inclination to suppress? 
The three years before I began my mental eye on a fege fire of ostracism and isolation. 
The only tutor, who openly identify as Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which has had its seat in my college. 
He was not only hated to be a Conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy and had written speeches for them. 
He was rarely there. 
He hated the place, found him parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his marxistisch-deterministische history. 
In 1997 he took a professorship at the University of Bilkent, in Ankara in Turkey. 
"You will not be happy here," he said. 
I started between Oxford and the home of my parents to move and found refuge in open-minded friends and family members in the city. 
My father told me that I was Oxford hated, and why I did. 
He seemed incredulous. 
During his time in the vierzigers, all political views were accepted. 
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly. 
This is something they would never do, not in my home town of the träumend Tower. 
Even my communist friends were always impeccable manners on the day. 
His wet eyes are marred. 
Give the whole thing a chance. 
I am sure that you are only neckt you. 
I would like to break the heart if you gingst. 
Exhausted by my frequent visits to London, my emotional resistance was weaker. 
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to the pressure and renounce his convictions. 
During a Tutoriums in the following week, when another history tutor seriously had claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same. 
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I admitted that my parents had been subjected to "brainwashing" and called them "old aiming." 
The relief lasted only a short time. 
It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career. 
At that time he wrote a week two Kolumnen in the Murdoch press. 
My door was closed. 
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, to my persecutors. 
When they walked away, I packte a suitcase and took the first train to London. 
I never returned. 
You can look forward to a schlapp series. 
But not an 18 year-old person should ever in an educational institution suffer from such intimidation and spite. 
And even more tragic is that Oxford was a university, not just 14 Tory, but so far behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought. 
"Valentino has elegance of celebrity" 
At the exhibition "Valentino - master of Couture," which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion maker. 
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani. 
This is the designer at the opening of "Valentino, master of Couture," a grandiose Retrospektive, for which more than 130 dresses of Haute Couture, the "Maison" have been created in the last 50 years. 
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent. 
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani, but without his distinguiert clientele would not be able to be written. 
Valentino has always been fascination for the stickig and the distant world of the aristocracy. 
In the first room of the exhibition, which has yet to be seen until 3 March, there is a wide range of private letters and photographs with the signature of the erlesen aristocracy, ranging from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon. 
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international Jetsets. 
But in love with the nobility, must not be a disadvantage. 
"At least they are not their, everything on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza. 
In the 1960s and 1970s lived in the Alps and were good friends. 
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host. 
"We all were pleased when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the Exfrau of "Heini" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos. 
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity. 
Yet he is a star. 
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino 
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the fashion maker. 
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to his home for dinner. 
We were around 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.. 
Every detail of his home, the decoration, the food and the music was recognized and felt its influence. 
"All the guests feel important and loved ones," remembers the "Top-Modell" their careers in the week of Haute Couture in Paris began in 1995. 
"He never comes out of fashion, because his works of art," she says finally. 
The origin 
The life of Garavani is not a story of Versessenheit, more of mutual love schafts. 
He likes people with good education and the highest qualifications, and they love him. 
One of the galleries in Somerset House, in a glorious and 60 meters long bridge, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and along the bridge, with a beautiful "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a coat wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress Farah Diba. 
In this audience of fashion dolls names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria mail-coaches and taxis, mette marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg. 
Naty Abascal and 2006 
Many of these should say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable." 
I remember perfectly. 
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a type of "Gillette West" and a jacket from the autumn/winter kollektion which in 1972. 
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the Musae of the designer. 
"I prefer it to everyone else because of his great love for women and because it highlights our beauty," Ex-Herzogin Feira adds. 
I like the colors he used; they have much light and highlight the face. 
The proportions are perfect. 
The princess and leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola ' Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino. 
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed, at long last, to have the age and the opportunity to wear a comparison of his night.... 
At the end of the 1990s, it was eventually. 
I bought my first valentino dress for a festival in the castle of my Prince Edouard de Ligne. 
It was a red dress with flying rock and a drapierten upper part, which makes his reputation. 
"It was a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo Arenberg. 
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains the Italian Aristokratin, between París, New York and Buenos Aires. 
The Princess D'Arenberg preserved their comparison of the fashion maker "with absolute care," "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the associated memories." 
The "king" of fashion 
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.

The most difficult profession in the world: the human Kawah Ijen 
For four euros the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk when they are 70 kilograms of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths. 
There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others are working literally in hell. 
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 workers who earn their lives by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java. 
To this end, he is every day down to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas from the earth ausströmend in contact with the air. 
Having a large stone extracted as a whole can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bambus körben on his shoulders on the slope of stone. 
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which is down to a level of 2386 metres, but the depleted agencies need more than 40 minutes for the rise in schildkröte rates, and they retain the balance and must put their steps carefully, so that they do not slip and fall. 
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist, a few years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen crashed. 
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur, which they cut down. 
It is the path between the tourists, who photographed as circus apes and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company a little bit further down on a total of 1 850 metres 
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, since 1960, the presence of the volcano and (rather) exploiting its workers, 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur. 
They then sold for 10 000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, because of this mineral in their everyday lives is widespread and the manufacture of matches, fireworks toys, cosmetics, destroy - yes, even the Bleiche of sugar is used. 
"As we normally 70 kilograms, we get to any way around 46 000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said Anto, who usually makes three routes on the same day. 
For each route he needed three hours, according to which he is completely at the end of the day, but then 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros). 
What a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but is three times as much of what he would earn with the toil. 
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the same day, and the average monthly income two million rupees (167 million euros), is very high," explained the winner, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali. 
He earned 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family, according to Banyuwangi, a village in the vicinity, returned, and for a reason, which in Indonesia is as important as the sulphur: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are, and I have brought them to Java, converting to Islam." 
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases. 
The 27-year-old Anto, for three years his life on the Kawah Ijen at risk, the sulphur in the first traces, even though he covers his face with a mask and Spezialbrille. 
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often hustet, and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano. 
This is the price he has to pay for the achievement of his dream. 
"I will work here two years, because I open a shop or wants to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than just acceptable English. 
This pleasant and intelligent, but the gestrafte young man could be a tourist guides, waiters or working on the reception of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels. 
He shares a dirty wooden lodge with other agencies, and every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also emit at night, where his distinctive yellow color bläulich shines in the darkness. 
The shadow challenging, it is rising in the light of a small few lamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money into the crater. 
Around 400 bodies on the krater bed baskets with sulphur on their shoulders. 
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction, in order to save costs, and provides the agencies, which are working on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment. 
You will not receive a share of the 30 000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of the natural park, along with the entrance fee in excess of 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) demanded by the tourists, the photography of the volcano and the human Tragesel. 
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protested Madrusin, a 42 years old, the three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen. 
He is in a position to 110 kilograms and assured that he continued, "as long as it is," because he has the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18 years. 
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life. 
Even if the sulphur throats burn and eyes jucken when the wind suddenly and einklemmt the mine workers in the thick pillars, rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases..., of course, apart from the usual breathing problems, today's pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have distorted by the weight of the baskets. 
The basket on his back is Unainik with his 53 years only in a position to carry 50 kilograms. 
Every day he and his associates 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, from three trucks on a road between the Gebüsch camp in taman sari in 18 kilometres away. 
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik said, and he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing. 
From his five children is the grandfather with his 30 years as a source. 
The time passes, but poverty is generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: those who as a human cash cow at the Kawah Ijen. 
Singapore needs babies to save the economy 
The Singapurer lay the blame for that they have no children, careers, the stress and the cost of housing and child-rearing. 
"The people of Singapore need to grow." 
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: we perform our civic duty and we create life! 
It seems incredible that the lyrics are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore for a viralen video on YouTube. 
The sentences are part of a Rapper-Songs, local slogans such as "pushing a" bao " (loaf) in the oven, about the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun. 
The advertising agency BBH, which revolved around the video, preserves the hope that the advert funny way to draw attention to the problem. 
Your creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfil their "national duty." 
This is something just for the Internet, which is why we have had to make it fun and funny. 
It is the biggest problem in this country. 
We are the worst performer in the world, so we felt that it is an issue for which we have had to deal with. 
We knew that the government had tried to do many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromonen or the organization of Speed-Dating-Abenden (fast Flirts). 
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed. 
That is why we thought: why do we not do something as creative as possible, in order to tackle this problem, such as a rap on komponieren? 
1.2 million children 
If this issue is not easy, it is the government of Singapore. 
Every year there are 1 300 US dollars for political action in order to encourage citizens to have more children. 
A package of government grants for couples and parents up to 15 000 Dollar per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits. 
But everything has had little success. 
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in south-east Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is well known. 
According to its national authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman. 
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as the ersetzung rate - was in 1976. 
So why are Singapurer not more children? 
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy of national authority, says that this "better education" and "greater career opportunities." 
"This has enabled the people to marry and to form a family much more options in terms of life objectives and to set priorities," she said. 
These changes in the social conditions for the higher number of people living alone, and the delay of marriage and births, the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore. 
Meanwhile, an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic increase in the number of uphold, in order to counter the reduction of the population, with resentment among the local population. 
In Singapore, there are Web sites where little covert xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for keeping wages low and do not integrate. 
The rise in immigration is also one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence. 
Since the elections, an attempt has been made, the problem with higher fees and charges for foreign workers. 
Unexpected consequences 
While the falling birth rate is the well-known impact on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policy, the Singapore example shows unexpected consequences. 
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are built. 
For example, it already has an impact on the housing market. 
The authority for urban development has begun to control the number of small Appartements, which are known as "schachteln" and in certain parts of the city should be built. 
These Appartements have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great success. 
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of single people, and that they are deterred by the construction companies to build large homes for families. 
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company El Developers, says that its "schachteln footwear" much faster than larger residential units sell. 
They are so popular, and the units are just days and even weeks out faster than the larger housing units. 
This means that our Cash Flow are much better. 
However, he admits that the new rules give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way, if they too many small residential units within a project to build. 
Too much stress 
Singapore is a city state. 
Even if these new rules pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, the talks with the Singapurern, who work in the financial community to see that they will not have a major impact. 
"The people are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why it is being delayed by many," says a young manager. 
The children can get others. 
"For me, it is important to have my own money and time," says another, roughly 20 years old man. 
Men and women have their careers, the stress and the cost of the property and education as a reason that they have no children. 
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to having children, because the government can still do so much. 
The offline private offline online is private 
Privacy 
According to the dictionary, it is the private or "area of private life, where they claim to protection against any kind of interference." 
What is private for someone under 16 years old? 
What is the definition of his daily life and the social networks used? 
He does the risks to which he is exposed, if he known on the Internet, which he would not share in real life? 
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years old, which are often on the Net. 
In four of the cases associated with "something very own" on a personal level, "the password and user" when they apply it to social networks. 
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post office," says the 10-year-old Jorge in the attempt, the meaning of "private" in Web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail - and Windows Live to explain where he has for two years on bank accounts. 
"These are very confidential secrets, they must know what my mother, but not the whole world," he confirmed. 
At the Belgian Francs, I invite beautiful images or images of games. 
I am reibe I have my time with friends. 
"I would share a photograph that is not for me, or someone who makes the stupid," he says. 
The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene photographs from Nacktes crime to publish, or insulting or violent comments to write. 
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he has been in Belgian Francs and nine Folger on Twitter. 
Most people are relatives. 
These include the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts. 
I reported to me on Twitter in order to express myself and to write interesting tweets. 
"I do not know if someone is saying, I invite them only high," he adds. 
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance or speak with friends," he states. 
Although he says that he never would accept an invitation from an unknown. 
Even if someone gave him a empfähle, he would ignore it. 
The case of the 14-year-old José is in a different way. 
The teenager has created Hotmail user accounts, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, 20 of the people not to know that he has attached his friends list. 
"It frightens me not because we have something in common, such as music," he states. 
Following the indication of the boy he has made no comments or him after his address or telephone number. 
"If somebody harassed or demanded of me, I simply entferne him from my account," he admits. 
José Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation. 
The boy experiences are not unknown, which is now known as ying. 
The acquaintance of a friend was taken hostage in a social network. 
They threatened him and demanded money. 
"He did not know who it was," he said. 
According to José, the victim, the user account was not closed. 
"He has just made private." 
Then he set out a series of steps to try to secure konfigurieren a user account. 
Unlike Jorge would these young photos of friends in uncomfortable or embarrassment. 
Yes, I would do so if he is unsympathetic or I want him judging one thing. 
"But I know that this ying is," he says. 
Key issues 
Marielos Porras, a teacher for English graduate in education and learning, says that in order to guide the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform. 
"The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information; with the appearance of these parties have changed the rules," she says. 
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a Master-Titels in teaching at the Yale and author of the book "Digital extra virgin and Immigrants" shaped these concepts to explain the phenomenon. 
The digitals extra virgin they are children and young people who have grown up with this technology. 
"We are digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them where we still have to learn," he says. 
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand of them that they have a defined criterion about what can be published or said, and this in an age where the maturity is not enough." 
"They should also be wählerisch if they are the most important thing to be loved, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds. 
According to the expert who is the most effective way to teach the children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions, which it brings to mind. 
"To tell you that they should not do not work," he says. 
Porras followed a number of possibilities: there are things that you find not tell a stranger, why the Internet? 
Or, if you like, if you have a photograph published by you, as you have published by a friend? 
Do you know what the rest of you publish? 
The other people had asked for permission if you pictures of celebrations were labelled? 
And one more question: do we all know what you are at any moment? 
Another point is for them to understand that they must act as they do offline. 
These are the same rules. 
"Someone is acting outside of the Internet with respect, decency and other principles, and do this same must apply to the social networks," he says. 
Monitoring 
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is essential that parents carefully read the guidelines of the social networks. 
If they all understand, they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet. 
"For example, the age or what you share or publish," he said. 
According to Guardia, the children of the lesson "thou shalt not talk to strangers" will be remembered. 
Completion of the summit of the Unasur without the publication of the Lima Declaration 
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced previously and in theory by the seven present leaders should be signed. 
Efe repeatedly sought access to the signed document in the sixth ordinary session of the Heads of State or Government of the Unasur, sources in the state and presidential firm initially announced that they would be handed over to the conclave, said afterwards, however, that some time would be published on the website of the Peruvian Government. 
With questions on the text, that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was set out in brief statements to the press. 
The journalists' access to information on the summit was limited at any time. 
During the day, it was in the press room only the image of the presidential meeting without tone with the word "private meeting, limited audio." 
The few information among the journalists, the press spokesmen of some of the governments present at the meeting of Unasur, but not from the Peruvian press officer. 
The only document, which was widespread during the day, was the list of participating presidents, and the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which called for more information. 
After that, the president of Peru signalled the media an Email with the "final declaration" of the summit, but the statement made by Humala and was not on the official document on the conclusion of the summit. 
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and on this occasion, despite strong calls by the press the so-called Lima Declaration, which had already been announced, nor published. 
On the official website of the ASPA can be persuaded that the document was published Tuesday. 
At two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have stressed that the information systems would be available for the journalists, but they are restricted to a large extent access to information. 
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru, to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries. 
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which starts on Monday in The Hague, in the process, the Lima to Santiago, to listen to the pleas of both sides. 
"We are going to be the verdict on the differences which we are currently talking to the International Court of Justice, obey and execute," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart. 
"Chile has been, is and remains a country that complies with international laws, seeking peaceful solutions to disputes, agreements and joins the international courts," Pinera's adds clicked his heels and gave Humala with a handshakes before the flags of both countries. 
The confirmation of the two presidents that they submit to the ICJ, came after Colombia after a decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious mistake, lodged a complaint against the agreement of Bogota had agreed to submit to the rulings of the International Court of Justice. 
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner. 
Paraguay, which has been in 2011 after the ousting of President Fernando Lugo is excluded from the Unasur, did not participate in the meeting. 
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks this morning and ended the summit shortly after midday in Lima. 
The Head of State read the final document, which it announced that 16 decisions taken and the guidelines for 31 projects between the South American countries on an investment amount totaling 17 billion dollars have been set. 
Among the decisions he said that the countries of the Unasur "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residency rights." 
He said that action would be taken forward to "the cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organized, transnational crime, as well as measures to access to medicines and to the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America to improve and in the event of natural disasters in order to act jointly and effectively." 
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) is not a triumphant tendencies, but should serve to increase our output and to identify a better future for our peoples," Humala added. 
"We have decided that a series of 31 flagship projects to give priority to the geographical links in South America, and particularly in rural and border areas will improve... and thus unite our countries and new forms of economic opportunities," the Peruvian president said in a statement. 
Among these projects would also be five Peruvian on the axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and which two should provide for a better relationship with Ecuador, even though he gave no further details. 
Similarly, the final document referred to the political situation in Paraguay. 
"We hope that the electoral process in this country for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded. 
The need for Latin America to continue an integrated region for prosperity and peace, and with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit. 
In this sense, said the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, before the start of his participation in the regional meetings that he held a meeting in Mexico with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, was expected to make the maritime conflict after a Bogota challenged the ICJ judgment to be treated respectfully. 
"Maybe I am tomorrow (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said. 
"We will review all these ways - they are not mutually exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua to make talks with Nicaragua," he stressed. 
"I hope to be able to say to the President Ortega that we take this matter as civilized and respectful as possible will be dealt with," Santos added. 
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention, at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, to attend. 
As part of the summit, in the runup to the defence ministers of the bloc to adopt the action plan for the year 2013, dialogue and consensus in relation to the defence of the region is to be strengthened. 
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, even though the latter is currently being ruled out. 
Peru has the presidency at the time of the regional bloc. 
"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens," says Rafael Correa 
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, but "South America really can learn something from Europe." 
Correa, on the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was held in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today are practically a fatherland." 
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur drive. 
"It must be achieved on the free movement of citizens and workers in all Latin American countries, as is already in the Andean Community is the case; however, there are still reactionary sectors, which are seeking a return to the past," he warned. 
The president of Ecuador also supported the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA), under the requirement to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and those to be taken into account, the San José Agreement signed on human rights. 
The teaching, never to commit to something, and in return, we will sign the South Americans everything. 
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights based in Washington, and financed by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, Ecuador Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has granted. 
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not have betrayed his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights." 
He added that there was "well-founded suspicions that Assange extradited to a third country, and his trial would not be complied with." 
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which he asked for it on its territory to undergo interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish law allows this through a video conference on the Ecuador Embassy in London could be carried out." 
Correa said that the danger that the health and mental condition of Assange would be compromised. 
"Since then he has been in our message, I have not spoken with him, the ambassador has informed me, however, that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but it is not serious," said the head of state of Ecuador. 
However, there was a danger that he took physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a narrow space, and no physical exercises carried out in the open air. 
"This would affect the health of every human being," he added. 
Correa was that the solution to the asylum, Assange since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London has been granted, the granting of a Freibriefs, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that this in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe. He stressed that there had been talks with London, in order to find a solution for the jailed founder of WikiLeaks. 
We do not act with human rights, this word in this case, we are not, however, there have been constant discussions. 
"The solution to this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer for Assange, balt azar Garzón, is conducting a series of procedures on various European institutions," he said. 
"If the UK morning granted this licence, I believe that this is done." 
And if Sweden Mr. Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as the Swedish law allows and has been made in other cases, the problem is resolved. 
Correa took the opportunity to confirm as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate, "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies are denied the freedom of expression." 
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said. 
In this sense he is happy that Ecuador is no longer such journalists "and not the bankers or hegemon and civic countries dominated," and, at the outset that he is in a re-election "will deepen the revolution, in order to continue the way in the right direction." 
Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must remain tough and no opportunism and no legal disguised coup d'etat" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay." 
The president of Ecuador is also the wish of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which announced the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua to negotiate the seerechtlichen border between the two countries, for "absolutely justified." 
At present, this judgment will not be implemented. 
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state. 
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be in the quest for a common path to be overcome. 
They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that they can be overcome and can look forward. 
He also relied on a good deal of the disputes over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to take recourse to international bodies, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very harsh." 
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador is to achieve his third mandate in a row, he gave this possibility "with much optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult." 
Correa promised that if he would lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life. 
Power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by the political power. 
"My political movement had the belief that I was guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfil this responsibility," he said. 
If I could win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life. 
This is also true when we lose. 
"This is decided," he said. 
Correa also referred to the handling of the health problems faced by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba. 
I have just been with the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he has told me that he is a planned, routine treatment have travelled there, and that would be expected that after the election campaign could once again travel to Cuba. 
"It is in no way a relapse into the health of President Chavez," he commented. 
The Ecuadorean leader was today in Lima on the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security. 
The cause of death for AIDS is now too late to identify 
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result: HIV positive. 
"It was as if a bombshell," he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis, the doctor without apparent success "tried to weaken." 
He hid it from his family. 
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to inform, and this with such dedication that he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday. 
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV-Einheit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he after several battles in 1994. 
Fabrizio is living with the human immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, which began in the 1990s was hard to imagine when many doubts, few treatments and more stigma. 
At the time, it has avoided even the director of a clinic in IMSS, "because it led to a dead end." 
At that time, AIDS was synonymous with death. 
Today, it is possible to have this syndrome with life to survive. 
However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and where the virus has already caused harm, and their immune system has outlived its usefulness, and are the victims of opportunistic infections. 
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, in other words, after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes up the treatment in good time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV-Einheit of HCG, Jaime Andrade villa nueva, and he said that this information in April this year had been supported by a respected scientific publication. 
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade villa nueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 inferred that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the quality of the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that the greater opportunities, which are not drugs: up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years for a count of 500 CD4. 
Simply put, the above mean that anyone at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis is HIV positive, in this sense, "easily can be 75 years old, as long as he is under control," the expert said. 
In order to be able to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans now average 76 years. 
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS, from 6 678 cases in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) reduced), but it is true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients have died in the national database. 
Only in Jalisco in 2011 255 people died, and until May of this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 universal access to anti-retroviral drugs. 
- Why, then, are still dying? 
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment. 
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital. 
At least in the past 12 years, we have had no problems with the drugs, but the problem is that the people in advanced condition, because they do not know their infection status, i.e. in very late stages of the disease. 
He makes a powerful statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, timely manner diagnoses are needed, and that is why all people, where it is needed, massive screening tests should be offered." 
This proposal will agree with the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio to conduct its test at a private laboratory, and for the sole reason, because it had made a friend of him, despite his young age was already in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications. 
Everything is different when you know that you're AIDS. 
Some people think that they are going to die, and do not want to hear. 
"If I have been going to die, then three times burst," one says in my case. 
The amendment was designed to improve, I am well ernähre, sport and take the medication. 
Today, his parents only know that he has cancer. 
I live a normal life, like everyone else. 
"I am doing a lot, I have an active, but Sexleben, I am on my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio has agreed to share intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, with his testimony to encourage those who are now in the context of the global AIDS Day. 
They should make the test if they belong to the high-risk group, but the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how all people can live responsibly. 
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012. 
Condoms behind the counter 
Between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, there are big holes, said Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, which is the cause of HIV. 
And the most important thing is prevention. 
In certain places "has actually increased the distribution of condoms; they were previously issued, they now give us packages with one hundred piece, which is a good thing, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said. 
At the risk of new infections among young people. 
"Why do you need?" is a question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and on the health care system, the young people do not want to suspend, assured the correspondent. 
He suggested to adjust this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but spending in public toilets, which are often visited by young people. 
It is not for the promiscuity to be promoted. 
They should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the Governor Emilio González replied to the question whether condoms will be distributed under his administration. 
"Sexuality is not enough; it is the best condoms to bring those who already have a sexual activity," he has brought it to the point. 
Key details of Jalisco 
There are 13 435 cumulative cases (12 158 AIDS and 1 317 HIV). 
The state is seen in 4th place of new and kumulierter AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV. 
92% of infection occur on sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2% flourishing atal. 
It is estimated that 50 000 people living with HIV, because for every registered case 4 or 5 people, who do not know it. 
After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a ruling that the restructuring of the debt of the group does not recognize Vitro, which has been reached on a trade konkurs in Mexico, is a sinister precedent for any national companies with operations in neighbouring countries, the payment problem. 
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies, which allow the Mexican laws in the country of the stars and stripes in contradiction with international agreements have no validity. 
In practice on 15 June recognition of the ruling by the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican company the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river well done. 
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico the floodgates of three inconsistencies in the Supreme Court of the United States. 
While the judge in the case indicates that the creditors in the bankruptcy law must be subject to the United States, says the Appeal Court of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the commercial konkurs are treated in Mexico. 
The first point would mean that international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with national cross profile is not known. 
In fact, to this end, the model law of the United Nations created for the unification of international trade law, although the American Law Institute has been used as an arbiter. 
Secondly, the judgment certain that without the votes of the societies for recognition of the liabilities of the estate, which the branches of Vitro with their parent company had not achieved the necessary majority for the restructuring of the debt. 
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws. 
Indeed, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved. 
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies) have been confirmed. 
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who are charged in the courts of the United States against Vitro, i.e. the funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergència, Elliot nacional and Liverpool Limited, had reached a majority. 
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent. 
This will not be taken into account by the Appeal Court. 
On the other hand, Vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country beatings. 
For this reason the family González Sada before the same conflict with an appeals court, so that the vote in plenary session will take place, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them were voting on. 
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare-Einspruch, which calls for a review of the procedure by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document from the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) has been sent out, what the procedure carried out by Vitro is described in the framework of the law on commercial bankruptcies, and what will be pointed out that we stick to the agreements signed by both countries, with the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law to comply with the United States. 
It also pointed out that the country the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors. 
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country. 
General assessment 
After complaints by the Mexican unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, several months did not come forward, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (the pilots) finally made progress.

In the runup to the Canacintra (the national chamber of the manufacturing industry), the governors of the southeast to unite to oppose the monumental establishment which partly protected areas and the mother of all threats to the industry. 
ACTA is dead 
Because the government of a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances of the Mexican ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, which is known by the English acronym ACTA, has not fulfilled the matter in accordance with the Mexican Institute for intellectual property has already been archived. 
As you know, these measures have been made, even though the Senate, because it as a violation of the freedom of expression in the social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life." 
The Weltenbummler of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was the composite sport for more than 60 years and has visited the whole world. 
Few people in Puerto Rico have a great intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes. 
Before a stroke in 2008 he was tied to the bench, Rexes was 6 years part of this sport, whether as players lower classes, players in the first National League, agent and head of BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of basketball Federation. 
"My whole life I have put many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I am president of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s was" remembered Reyes during a visit by Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years ago. 
"Basketball was my life." 
Reyes is exaggerating with this statement. 
The walls of his house are almost all with photographs and memories of his long career decorated and they testify. 
Bayamón 
The emotional memories are those of his time in the Vaqueros of the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or manager of the club celebrated. 
"These were my best years, which I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of the Vaqueros of eight championships since 1967 as CEO, Mitgeschäftsführer or coach. 
There have been many years, including the five championships in a row from 1971 to 1975. 
And then passed me with a schaft in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in BSN. 
From then took over, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, " Reyes says. 
I know that I am gene Bartow, who is here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m great players. 
You Möchtest him? " 
This was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had. 
Bartow recommended after the free junk surgeon Raymond Gausse, who could creep and was one of our best Werfer. 
I remember how he said that if Mincy schaft had made it possible for Bayamon, Gausse for another. 
The schaft of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he had already stood at the top of the association. 
At that time he preferred his executions and to enjoy Mincy in the national team. 
I remember when we, for the first time in the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico won against the United States. 
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in which we showed the fourth place, which should have been bronze, if not the Canadian referee had been the last Spielzug for the second time repeated, Reyes said. 
Was this group of the World Cup in 1990, the best team you have ever seen? 
It is among the best, as well as those in the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream team won. 
My favorite is the team for the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won, and the team of the United States offered a struggle, as they were when they won bronze at the World Cup. 
When the team was not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury could not be in the process. 
One team, perhaps in terms of figures was not the best, with which we won a gold medal, and we were very pleased, was that of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina. 
With players such as "Canito," Pablo Alicea, and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the banned players because of the events at the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, contrary to every prediction won the gold medal. 
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico? 
There was no doubt that Piculín Ortiz. 
His figures at the international tournaments are impressive. 
No one in Puerto Rico has so dominated at this level, such as Piculín. 
And this, without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he has played. 
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico? 
This is a difficult question. 
We have had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres. 
Among the boys I liked the work of Leo Arill well. 
What do you glaubst is the best, what you have achieved in the association? 
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, BSN at the beginning of the 1990s, up to 17 teams in a season. 
What do you still have to do? 
There are things that I could have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes. 
The fact that the boys in Ponce, for example, are only in their area and only in the national Playoffs teams from other corners of the island. 
Today, the children unnecessarily make many trips and games. 
At least I can see the result of mandatory training and courses for coaches, offizielle and referees. 
This is something I am proud. 
What do you make today? 
I listen to music, see videos of music from my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I can go to a basketball game. 
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side. 
Larry Hagman is dead 
Larry Hagman was on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth-type figure on (Texas) was born and became world famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J. R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played an unscrupulous, devious and manipulative businessman.

He made all the joy that he knew. 
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much. 
"He was an original person and lived life in full terms," Gray said in a statement. 
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 liver zirrhose, and he admitted that he had for years been much drunk. 
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he tested a transplant. 
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman was on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the Sitcom "Jeannie Bezaubernde" known to the television channel NBC. 
He played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose lives will be put on the head when he hits an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), which he will live at home.

His film work included the criticism good roles in "the Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors." 
But it was his masterful Posting of the charmingly disgusting J. R., Hagman became a superstar. 
The dramatic series of television network CBS on the ewing clan and other characters in their surroundings, from April 1978 to May 1991. 
The slogan "who fired at J. R.?" the expectation for an episode filled with emotion, where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars have been wagered in hospitals. 
In doing so, the series has reached a record audience in that time. 
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, she was seen by an average of 41 million TV viewers, the "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, the 50 million viewers. 
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J. R. (read by Mary Crosby), who had been shot. 
J. R. States and threatening to portray them as prostitutes, if they are not relying on the city, but others had reasons for wanting to see him dead. 
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and forsaking husband, who sought his sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), einweisen. 
"I know what the tombstone of J. R.," Hagman said in 1988. 
It should read "here rests with the honourable citizen J. R. Ewing." 
This is the only business that he has not won. 
Victoria principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, remembered Friday in Hagman as a "huge personality on and off the screen." 
It is for millions of respecter in the world unforgettable and irreplaceable and we have had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts. 
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were a few months ago with great success in the TNT television broadcast. 
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter has just been made, told the station. 
From Warner or of the TNT, there was no immediate statement on how the loss of Hagmann would be dealt with in the series. 
Born in Fort Worth-type figure on Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, the classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan." 
Martin was still a teenager when she Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman. 
He tried his luck in the theatre houses in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served from 1952 to 1956 in the Air Force in England.

In 2001 he betitelte his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall" (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life. " 
"I have written nothing, which I believed that it might harm or in any way could harm," said The Associated Press at the time. 
After the liver transplant he fought for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help frightened patients. 
"I advise them to give them courage, I meet with them if their operations are forthcoming and then," he said in 1996. 
I would like to give them a little comfort, such as "no fear, it is a bit uncomfortable for the first time, but you will go well." 
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns. 
The start of the course, who studied the "end of the world." 
Every week to investigate the students' apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming. 
Each semester, when the professor decided to hold a course at the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long" census " of the Maya-Kalenders on 21 December, from which many people believed that it was the end of the world. 
But Charmé had no idea what it should be expected in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, some as "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins. 
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester that has ever occurred," Charmé said this week the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey). 
If someone analysed what is happening today in the world, as if we were far from 30 days, it would be a really good period. 
And he reminds us that the bad things are good for those with apocalyptic mentality. 
And he is not the only professor of this semester, the last in the history of the "end of the world." 
In Temple, the beisitzend Professor Barry Vacker "the media, culture and the end of the world." 
Every week to investigate the students' apocalyptic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming. 
"We analyse why these ideas spread at the time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are being offered, which lead to a certain human behaviour. 
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, could be a war break out. 
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and studied how they compared with the real life. 
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," Vacker said. 
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history, Matthew and his colleague Solari Restall, a beisitzend professor of art history and Anthropologie, a team formed a line with the simple name "the end of the world." 
"We are taking 2012, so that we always retain the option to hold the course, in the event that the world is not lost," Restall said. 
In spite of the "imminent demise," the students must study, develop projects and participate in audit. 
In Penh State the final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other opportunity than "to continue to work at night, where the world is supposed to end," Restall said. 
The courses were very popular. 
"In two hours there were no seats left," Restall said about his course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students. 
For weeks before semester at the beginning, we have received e-mails from students who asked whether tickets are still free. 
The students, for their part, say that the course is among the interesting performer. 
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey. 
The apocalyptic cults or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence. 
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing to have seen all the apocalyptic films. 
"I have never heard of a classroom where it will be informed," he admitted. 
I enjoy it. 
But none of the surveyed students - and not even a professor - said to believe in the final date of 21 December. 
"Our first project was the prophecy of the Maya, and in some ways we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester. 
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall. 
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in the Western society, several centuries ago, when the people on changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world. 
The Internet has increased this speculation. 
"Wherever people do not think so," he says. 
This is mainly in the English-speaking world. 
Joseph doug herty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, responding quickly to the question whether he is there a course on the "end of the world" would know. 
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as a suggestion for an exception to a higher authority. 
We have a pardon from the Pope. 
Restall pointed out that over the years many days from the last court, and said that if on 21 December nothing happens, "people immediately think of a new date," or about philosophierten, 21 December the beginning of a seven-year period, which would be the end of the world. 
Students and professors are taking this date easily. 
Several have said that they celebrate "the end of the world" want to go. 
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student of communications.
