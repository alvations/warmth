The Republican Party against Obama's re-election strategy
Republican leaders have justified its policy of necessities in the fight against electoral fraud.
Brennan's centre, however, a hoax calls the myth that the electoral fraud in the US is less common than the number of people who die after lightning struck.
Republican lawyers, for the last ten years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the american part of the democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the US responsibility for the organisation of federal elections in individual states.
And in that spirit, most american governments since 2009 promulgated by the new laws, which make the selection process, or to register on the electoral roll.
This phenomenon has boomed after elections in November 2010, during which the added 675 new republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, only for the year 2011 to 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Those laws also limited periods for elections in advance, the zneplatňují right to write a list of voters in the election day and taking away the right to vote of citizens with the registration of a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, a voter-půkazu identity with a photograph of any U.S. state.
The first state that this requirement was introduced, Indiana.
The constitutionality of indianského Act confirmed in 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court.
The republican offices bustled with the extension of this procedure, as well as other countries.
For the past two years to support the proposals for such laws in 34 states in order to force voters to present identification with the picture.
It should be noted that, unlike the Quebec american citizens do not have universal identity card, such as health insurance card.
In fact, owns 11% of american citizens, i. e. 21 million people aged allows for the vote, no photo ID issued by the government in their state.
Also has an identity card about five million new voters in 2012.
The acquisition of the identity card, often costs more than $100.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affecting mostly young, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35,000; 18% of people over 65 years of age and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years, therefore, does not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
The students, who are known as the voters of his shift to democratic candidates, in several states are entitled to use his identity card with a photograph of his school.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather republican candidates, the cards issued by those clubs in the election.
Until 2004, require no state election proof of citizenship.
The first such requirement introduced Arizona.
From 2011, has about a dozen states laws, which requires voters to prove that they are american citizens.
Obviously these measures aim to limit the number of votes from the hispanic community.
It was noted that two of the three hispanics prefer democratic party.
Republican legislators in 2011, supported in eight states laws, which removes the registration of voters on election day.
In addition to limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to the voters, who want to write.
Those restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the general election in 2004 helped campaigns for the registration of voters to register of approximately 10 million inhabitants.
The measures taken after 2009 but caused the decline in writing new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
Republican legislators, then in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general election in 2008, Florida accounted for 33% of african-american voters, who voted in advance, although african american voters in this state was only 13%.
For Hispanics.
Made just 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens of the voting in advance.
On the other hand, the whites, who accounted for 76% of all voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Against the approval of the laws, which restrict voter registration, of course, very strongly built democratic lawmakers and their supporters.
Democratic governors have blocked his veto of a few bills.
With a view to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
They have managed to limit the damage in part.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of the identity card with a photograph taken only 16 of 34 states.
The newly introduced rules but undeniably difficult in 2012 in the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics speak mainly on the bias approved laws and consider these apparent desire to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The report from the Centre Brennanova 2011 shows that states, where these laws were approved, 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the american part of the democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: tests or not?
The test of a dog brought some bad results, which were wrongly negative or even positive, which led to unnecessary medical.
All of this has increased the reluctance of the men, who had been so reluctant to investigate all go.
Let the exam or not?
We have asked for a view of two experts.
In studies conducted in the US have shown a high degree of contamination between the different groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Further studies, this time, found the mortality rate among the different european patients undergoing testing, and those who had to go.
This study also showed after 12-letém apart, that those tests, have a 30% to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore recommend tests from 50 years of age or from 40 years if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Risk group are also men of african origin.
The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such species, which are unresponsive.
It is therefore necessary to properly explain the patient risk his type of cancer, to offer him a possible alternatives, not necessarily do not treat prostate cancer, which does not have a long-term impact on the life and focus in these cases, rather than to the active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, who was diagnosed with cancer, cure, since their type of cancer is aggressive and threatening them to life.
Design them instead of active surveillance, and in the case of the progression of the disease by providing them with the treatment.
More and more frequently and with greater accuracy set criteria, which help to deciding which type of treatment and who does not.
Still, therefore recommend testing.
But it is important to go through an interview with the doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo testing or not.
In cooperation with the International urologickou company created Movember movement tool that allows you to assess for and against in the context of the examination of the dog.

Disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite progress in research seems to be the best means of reducing the risk of the disease of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently moved, it could be prevented by up to 30% of cases of cancer.
`` If they stop smoking, this figure would be increased by at least 50%, ''underlines André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that approximately 10% of the cancer-causing inheritance.
A percentage also remains completely uncorroborated.
For the canadian company for cancer research remains a priority in the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers.
Cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
It's extremely harmful to human health.
`` Today is in Quebec 1.5 million smokers, ''she says, shaking her head spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the smoker to quit smoking, decreasing the risk of cancer death by half.
The mass
Well-shaped and obesity are under the SCC additional risk factor for the incidence of the disease.
Increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus.
`` Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer of the colon, ''says the report.
Nutrition
The organization also recommended to reduce the consumption of red meat.
At too high consumption may lead to an increased risk of kolorektální cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid even the sausages, for the same reason.
Preserving meat smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
`` They can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer, ''says the report.
Vitamins
In recent times, the various scientists focused on the connection between vitamínovými additions and cancer.
But research has not yet yielded definite conclusions.
Studies on vitamin E are under the SCC contradictory.
Although one of them to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, another study speaks rather on the increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D for cancer is clearly shown.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and the precedent of the family with your doctor.
`` To undergo testing does not mean that you have cancer. ''
Higgs boson explored
The notice on the likely discovery induced Higgsova bosonu last summer, a legitimate excitement.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism, which is responsible for all matter in the universe.
And on the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model-our best or the `` least bad ''explanation of the nature and the behaviour of matter-but which has not yet been empirically observed.
Scientists, however, there is not yet 100% certainty that the Higgsův boson.
No doubt about it, that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgsovu bosonu, as predicted by the standard model.
New data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto, it rather confirm, however, all data, so that we can have absolute certainty.
However, assume the Higgsův boson, because the risks of error appears to be small, and take a look at what's happening.
In this world quite definite law, under which the two things can occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule can not bypass-and to try too hard, otherwise they will hurt.
Although the particle physics is very strange world, it also shows that it is like the law: Pauli ratio principle, under which the two can not occupy the same space particles at the same time, if they are in the same `` quantum state ''- this `` status'' roughly, creating some of their properties.
Furthermore, the particle physicists are divided into two categories.
On the one hand, we will find the good citizens, or fermions, dutifully comply with Pauli principle.
And at the other end of the range, the mean-spirited bosony anarchists who appreciate anything-certainly not this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way a perfectly), which is the Particle Adventure, laboratories, Berkeley: mesony, here we go unnoticed, and `` force ''particles, which are spreading large natural forces and which is the higgs boson probably related in some way.
It should, however, say that these bosony are so exotic pets, how it would be possible to believe.
If you read this article, it's because bosonu with unusual banality: the photon, or `` particle of light, ''which is `` carries the electromagnetic force.''
Indeed, when the particles with electric charge accelerate or change its direction, `` disturbed ''by the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a pebble tossed into the pond.
This `` interruption ''created an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave is nothing more than a photon-and thus one of bosonů, `` right force''.
A more stable field
But it's also with Higgsovým bosonem, only that `` disturb ''should be the other field, the Higgs field, that this boson appeared.
The Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite must be achieved very high energy values, as with the frozen surface of a pond, already ripples just a lot of a large boulder.
For this reason, it is used as a huge accelerator as part of the accelerator in a laboratory in the CERN Large Hadron Collider with welcome volumes is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - to develop such energy.
Analogies with the electromagnetic field we again suits to clarify the relationship between the Higgs and stuff.
With the electromagnetic field respond not all particles or all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but no other-a piece of paper, for example, he will never be alone to keep in the fridge.
And anyway, with Higgsovým field to respond to all particles: that is, they have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, let him have it.)
And Miss Smith asks why all these surveys are, `` bring us? ''
From the point of view of science for confirmation of the validity of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to examine any inconsistency between the observations and predictions of SM.
Many physicists, moreover, literally, wants to find them, because the slightest difference could open space of the `` new physics ''and close some of the gaps in the model.
To say that the model is still a major, no clarification of gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which consists of approximately 80% of the space matter (oops!).
The device CERN, however, until such contradictions.
Responses
The response of these research in the day-to-day life of Mr and Mrs Novákových can be very difficult to predict, however, would be a mistake to assume that it will not be no.
Behold: at the very beginning of 60 years at Bell Labs laser pioneers had no idea about the revolution, already in their work.
Anticipated scientific uses, but nothing else.
The physicist Willard Boyle-who worked at Bell Labs, where it was invented in the 1960 s, and which created the first permanent laser beams were pulse (previous) in 1962, I have already said-the laser was initially considered a `` toy ''in a lab.
Just imagine …
And besides, it may also result from all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a light sensor in 1969 during their work aimed at the optics.
This sensor, though that Boyle at first, so plan now serves as the `` eye ''of all digital cameras in the world and gave him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC will necessarily change my life, however, this means that no one really knows …
Palliative care-as the best way to go from Le Devoir &pipe; life …
Through its Commission for dying with dignity is Quebek recently engaged in a delicate issues relating to the end of life.
The debate should be about to continue, and at the same time to the bill.
In this crucial area remains to do a lot of work.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in detail.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in her apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was consuming him, gave him a two-year suspension.
`` They gave me five years of life, and it's been seven, ''he says without emotion on his bed in the house for the palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
`` But it's still a shock, that you can not prepare, ''he adds.
The disease had done their work: the extreme weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself to the bathroom or feed himself.
Resignation is looking at a tasty breakfast and agrees that it will help him to eat.
It is a brave and he even smiles, talking to strangers, who had stopped, his medicines, offer a bath.
The courage of a death.
`` My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhoea, that degrades me, ''she says.
A few hours later, he found a team of doctors on his drug problem.
`` Throughout the life of one learns that guys pee standing up, ''says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the establishment of Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the stage for some people, the child is an unacceptable humiliation.
`` Depends on the skills of the man '', whether the return, says psychologist.
The view of many people who deal with paliativní care, the crucial moments in the heart of a return.
Patients who come into the home with paliativní care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
Their forecast is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage of their team of doctors and nurses who care for them, the so-called `` medical care. ''
In the case of Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear to die `` choking conscious ''.
The disease but allowed me to discover their children.
`` I have got good kids, ''he adds.
`` In my life, I do not have any wishes, ''he says, and then says, so she put on a ventilator.
Yet I am still pleased in the days following the last visit to the son of Italy.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois in collaboration with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body with the help of nutrition.
Looks like a palliative care, which starts, if not to do anything else.
That death was more comfortable.
In Québeku seems a bed palliative care at 11 700 inhabitants.
It's very little, if we realize that we are all gon na die.
Here, life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martelová, one of the medics in the home.
Whether the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If the man is dying, he may provide for a sip of brandy or Pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics will no longer have to guard the blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night, carrying beer Mr X, who later died in the night.
This morning the beer finishes his son in honor of the late father.
`` We help patients as well as their relatives, ''says Nathalie Savard, director of care services.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois coming days, one behind the other, but the resemblance to each other.
Beside třiadevadesátiletého man who enjoyed the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on cushions, while toasting his honor, dying tragically the 36-year-old surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children, after testing all options to survive.
`` Half a year, there is always a three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer to 45 years, ''says Dr. Christiane Martelová with concern.
53% of the patients who come to the home of Victor-Gadbois, here comes from their homes, 47% of hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
They say that 77% of Canadians simply does not have access to palliative care, i. e. the care, which is intended to ease the suffering, as soon as the sick person comes to the final stage of his life, whether it's at home, in a hospital or nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the company for the palliative treatment of Grand Montréal, specialised in more or less exclusively on the care given to cancer patients.
And just this crucial non-availability of health care in Quebec, leads to a number of doctors specialising in palliative care fears the adoption of the law on euthanasia and asistované suicide.
Since October is circulating in the manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martelové Quebec healthcare system is not sufficiently powerful to ensure access for all persons to high quality palliative care than it will be possible to agree with the execution of euthanasia.
As he says, has recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days on standby in great pain, without anyone made the necessary steps to her.
Fears for patients to ask about the killing, on the grounds that they lack the appropriate care.
And at the same time, a number of oncologists and caring patients until the last moments, regardless of the negative outlook.
Hopes for the survival of Hélène Richardové were already quite minimal, when she left the intensive chemotherapy.
When I told my onkoložce, finishing with treatment, she said that she regrets that do not fight, tells us.
And he told me that it's over!
There is the all-powerful care
Dr. Martelová estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors for their wishes to fill them, as a team of palliative pussy eased the pain.
But it is to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereauové, director of palliative care in society for domestic palliative care area Grand Montréal, patients prevent pain therapy in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life often doctors use paliativní sedate the patient sleep until the moment of death, whether in fits and starts, or whether his sedatives administered permanently.
You can not pretend that this part of the suffering of the notice.
The patient, who get rid of pain, will have greater access to the paliativním sedation.
The sick, which is given a sedative, always say the same thing: `` I want to die. ''
But it was not necessarily mean `` I want to provide the euthanasia '', it means more to me, `` I want to get rid of the pain. ''
The implementation of this story to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for Research in the healthcare sector.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Administration officials, businessmen in construction and public works, lobbyists, political parties and experts on the italian mob still tell what they know about the amazing `` system '', in which the construction, public officials, politicians, trade unionists and the mob.
This `` field ''came the Quebec taxpayers dearly in particular between 1990 and 2000.
`` It's interesting how the system broke from the time that we have taken a key measure, ''says Jacques Duchesneau, ironically quebecký MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It erupted in 2011 scandal on the basis of a rigorous investigation focused on the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in Quebec, which then liberal quebecký Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
`` Duchesneauova report ''confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque financing and the corruption of public officials.
`` From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, ''he says, `` saved only by the Ministry of Transport on procurement billion dollars,'' when some people keep the lid on his instincts to obtain the share!
`` The Commission has already brought Charbonneauova to resign two mayors, ''he adds, with the hope that she could `` uncover the subtlety of some people.''
The permanent unit for fighting corruption, based in 2011.
The permanent unit for fighting corruption, based in 2011 is also involved in a fight with his army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
The officers `` Marteauovy Company, ''who, since 2009, to ensure that the Montreal `` cartel'' penězovodů significantly reduced inflate contracts …
In recent weeks, carried out a series of inspections and accused of fraud and corruption of local councillors, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of the municipality of one of the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who had resigned from his post as the mayor of the municipality of Laval, the third largest city in the Quebec.
It is suspected of repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Formal charges have already received also traffic engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lina Zambito.
Lino Zambito caused a sensation when the Commission said the mechanism of the `` system ''taking public procurement.
He gave during these years, 3% of the value of the contracts, which v Montréalu won the middleman, coupled with the Mafia, which then transferring money to the party, Union Montréal, which ran for mayor of Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito was after 2000 generous to all parties and donated more than 88 000 canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euros) provinčním parties, but especially the liberals, who had been in power.
He also admitted that the organized illegal fund finances for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie Normandeauovou.
Contracts with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
In Montreal worked `` system ''corruption very alert.
Gilles Surprenant, a former traffic engineer, before the Commission described in great detail: during the 10 years from construction companies, presents an invitation on trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, the hockey games and pocket money, worth a total of $736 in exchange for contracts with penězovody in nadsazoval price.
Other public officials from the transport sector, they admitted that they pay the fees that 30% to 40% to overestimate invoices through the untrue víceprací.
The organizer of the mayor's party Martin Dumont then accused Tremblaye from that, without the embarrassment of a blind eye to a parallel budget, which brought the Treasury to his dirty money.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which plunged into the vast Montréal crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first montrealskými members, who issued a warning signal.
As Mayor circuit Rivière-des-Prairies east of the island since 2010 advocates against the sale of the municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for … 1.6 million promotérům directly in the middle of a thriving trade with real estate.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
On the investigation, which was finally opened, says that `` pulling the strings in trying to understand the functioning of the system, to stop the ants promořeného gangrene and načapalo culprits. ''
The process is under `` painful, but positive. ''
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but it is necessary to set up their own v Montréalu investigative unit and ensure that the sight of these shady practices could not go back.
Like cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that `` public officials to steal hundreds of millions of dollars '', but is concerned, in particular, the role of `` informed members of this ruse ''if the game-playing wet!
Estimated that 70% of the funding of election campaigns in Québeku comes from dirty money, and with the irony, adds: `` I have heard that it's just a fact. ''
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, but it will solve the situation: `` until they are strictly limit the election expenses, dirty money away from politics. ''
Proposes a comprehensive control system for the award of public contracts and financing parties: `` I can not fall below; focusing boldly to the substance of things, we can build on solid foundations, and with greater scrutiny and respect for the law. ''
If this story defamed the image of Quebec City and Montreal abroad Duchesneau recommends that everyone who is laughing at him, to see their own backyard …
`` PSG's FC Barcelona! ''
This season with PSG put new momentum.
How to explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went to yourself, or completely new dimension to PSG.
They came to us in the big leagues.
Every day I get them further.
The technical team helped me a lot, too.
Every day, these facts to increase the level of the game.
And in the games, it's easier.
In football, things are going very fast.
But not lose his head.
Since my beginnings in the prep school in INF Clairefontaine until the transfer to Saint-Etienne, I was always pushed the various stages.
Taking advantage of the competitive environment, then by Carlo Ancelotti …
Reinforcements from this summer are used to play games at a very high level.
They also know that each training is essential.
And it follows that the player as I have felt more like a team and wants to make the maximum power.
And furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in the context of my position.
The hand has assistants, such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And Ancelotti has the word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all of the technicians.
Today in the league equal and is among the best european coaches.
She has great experience and with excellent teams won a lot of titles.
He also worked with the outstanding players.
I will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I am with him a reassuring conversation.
I had had a series of injuries.
The trust which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
How do you see the first part of the season, PSG?
In the 1 st league us Lyon took the lead position.
But staying in tow.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: very easily advanced into osmifinále.
What's your club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be for high-quality european teams tough.
We want to win first of their qualifying group before the gate, so we could play in osmifinále backlash at home.
PSG may happen in the short term, a major european club?
The budget already has …
The Paris has become a major european club, to win the title and to make history.
Today, it is not yet.
The financial website has PSG funds to this intention did take place.
And it would be a big failure in nezvítězit 1. the league as last season?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, really want to win the league title.
Last season we still missing.
In May, we were disappointed, because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
We picked 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points are clear master …
But another club, Montpellier, had the season even greater.
I think that this year, it will.
Even if the title, seeking even great teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think we have a weapon to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from PSG expect too much?
It is not unusual to expect from us a view of what we invested and we have the players.
It absolutely accept.
The fact is that, when the home defeat of Troyes 4: 0, and he still finds something in the paper about, so it's not nice.
One wonders what you people they can still want more.
It is, of course, winning 4-0 for each weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to set up a game style.
To build a team you need time.
In the Champions League, we have shown that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, who had a second season had osmifinále, while also invested large amounts of!
Given the sums invested, one might have expected that you will have in front of the other 15 points ahead!
That insult the other clubs and the french league.
The clubs, Lyon and Marseille, in last year's season, too, with a new PSG shifted into a new phase.
It shows how 1 League is amazing.
I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems as if the PSG in relying on the performance of Zlatana Ibrahimoviče.
It is good that he says that there is a `` dependency on Zlatanovi ''.
This means that Ibrahimovič is very powerful, and it gives a lot of goals.
I lost, and demonstrated that the star is 1 League.
Everywhere, where he has demonstrated that it is a big player, a global star.
In our team we respect the human and the player.
He respects the people around him.
What it is, is really remarkable.
This led others to increase its own level of the game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, too, on the other side of growth.
How you felt the euro in 2012, with the french entertainment?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to play this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I could not play the way I'd imagined.
But I have seen it and I came out of it a stronger.
Today I am alive and well in the representation of play good matches.
And I hoped for from the onset of the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves, to our exemplary manner.
How do you see the first months of Didier Deschampse at the forefront of the national team?
The results speak for him.
In the qualification for MS, we are in a good place.
The coach chooses the top players, is nearby and can get for the victory.
So was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want them to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal that we qualified for the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps lead our team to Brazil.
It's a draw (1: 1) from 16 October in Spain with a solid starting the match?
This game gave us confidence.
We are all fighting for the team.
Before this shock in Spain for his career had experienced such a contest.
Thanks to the Bitcoinu can pay and sell without banks'
All the negative impact of the current financial transactions based on central banks identified transactions and the cost of processing among the beneficiaries.
As part of these technologies, often the truth, there is clearly feel the political outlook: the belief that the current financial system built on bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
The Bitcoin inventor's Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), as a virtual money (transferable, however, dollars, euros, …), so the secure transfer protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between partners.
Thanks to the 15 000 computers connected to the network has already been registered around 200,000 transactions.
About a thousand websites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
Kurz bitcoinu first peak $30 (23) in June 2011, five months later dropped to 2 dollars, today was moving about 10 dollars (summary of courses at bitcoincharts website. com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products that nothing is impressive.
And yet the European Central Bank (ECB) on this fact interested in its report on the virtual finances, which came out in October.
Bitcoin describes as `` the most successful virtual money '', `` konkurující the dollar and the euro ''and `` the equivalent of current money''.
Bitcoin from other types of virtual money vary them as `` credits ''used for the procedure in the video game, which one gets the game or which may purchase (and sometimes back exchange).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
Every month, but the central government controls and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoinu are all network nodes Depositary book current accounts, controllers, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
How this network works?
Each transaction between two users is, in fact, between two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures the anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed encryption system with a key.
The network can verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that all exchanged bitcoiny existed in a public book of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
A crucial phase in writing this new transaction in this book.
Using a mathematical task is to resolve the computers, which grant, a temporary central banker, will have the right to finish this additional line.
This is a phase cut file; i. e. on the transformation of a file on the haircut and a unique digital print.
Computers `` take ''this new transaction and added to her number, then the whole `` cut''.
The aim is to find the number, which provides specific fingerprint (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number, the other nodes easily checked his accuracy.
The transactions are then indestructible displays connected to a string of all other transactions; any adjustment would lead to a change in print.
If a user wanted for fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly (10 minutes), the network confirmed only one of the two transactions-the second to be abandoned, because each of them has a different impression.
The computer that challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.
In order to avoid inflation, shared this remuneration regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is so limited by the number of 21 million, however, they can share up to nine hundred million, so the room for the margin is here …
The difficulty of the task is also increased with the growing level of calculation.
The network has had its downs.
Website for Bitcoin provide services, were attacked and the alienation of stored bitcoinů.
`` The opening of the protocol, ''says Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, the company for payments for real money, which uses a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the potential money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem is also true for cash.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like blogging platform WordPress, adopt them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed the book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů orbiting.
In November were launched `` huge discounts. ''
`` It was a change of thirty thousand dollars, ''says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul engaged to bitcoinů gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of the teaching of the book on this money, has a great deal of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
His system, the Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu pay phone, but uses the system for verifying the Bitcoin transactions, which are due to be cheaper.
Holder also manages its identity and so can remain anonymous.
The system is easy to be set in the traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
Just tell the address, which can be a phone `` photograph and recognize, ''explains Pierre Noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge the hierarchical systems and the transition to the systems.
`` Before the Bitcoin wins, it will take a while, but the 2013 could be decisive, ''predicts.
In its report, the ECB also foresees a re-evaluation of the various risks, which are now considered to be elevated, if this kind of money will be successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and american forces should be followed by the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army took control of the territory, and the Afghans elected its own future and wait for everything from us.
Most people have suffered the Afghan countryside, which we punished, as we thought they were terrorists.
And we also, we lost 88 of the slain soldiers, and what about all those injuries and mutilation.
Talibánci consist of foreign extremists, the former leaders, who have fled to Pakistan, but often the peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies as in soviet times.
They just want to defend its ancient and archaic traditions, even when he joined the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, the Uzbekové, tajiks.
Now experiencing tolerance and frequent local support for the insurgents, but if the western forces to withdraw their support for the fall.
The departure of french troops from the foundations of the Nijrab, which I watched from the mountaintops posázených mandloněmi thanks to the french loans, orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul attack helicopters in the air without an escort.
From the end of 2014, already in Kabul will be talibánci so active.
From their unstoppable process in 1994 to 1996 conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty, and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the different odbojovými groups.
Their seizing control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, return to security.
Afghans paid the price for tmářství these villagers, which consumed organisation Al-esses' ida, their situation, however, in our time.
Former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan government and the current talibánci agree in order to preserve the women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries from the war against the soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became hustlers, seized by the state land, which sold as building land refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used the huge american contracts for subcontractors.
Discredit; most of them had never been in a fight.
According to what I heard in the campaign, people crave the government, which will form the thief.
A number of young wants to leave, leave those who benefit from the american generosity: capital flight is significant.
Young already tired of war and ideologies.
During his exile in Iran or in Pakistan knew the modern world and its benefits to them.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul lives currently 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities are state schools filled with girls and boys, go there.
These young people will be to provide jobs, they no longer want to return to the past tmářství parties or corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones; and the turkish tv series, which show the modern world, monitor everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities, which stands up to her forehead, considered legitimate?
Former masters of the fight against the soviet army already renewing the provincial militias that are beyond the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with a strong influence of local identity, should they should enjoy a degree of devolution along the western states, but the US wanted her to transform into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the abolition of the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the Constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
His country, however, is from 50. even earlier years significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry failed to restore the dam, no work, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing to produce only fruits and vegetables.
The preference is a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.
Spread rumors that Afghanistan has a great beauty.
And it just had the feeling that western countries were only to be seized.
Without power to the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, and with no means of transport of raw materials through the mountains but no minerals can take place.
The Chinese already almost abandoned mine copper Mes Aynak and let international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) the opportunity to explore the vast Buddhist site in order to maintain the role of the major employer in the whole province.
One day, it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depends in large part of imports and exports, to resume normal relations.
The departure of french troops was completed on November 20.
The new agreement on cooperation projects the continuation of the current types of assistance: girls' and boys' lycea, french departments at universities, the French Institute of cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, promoting the archeological delegation.
Since 2009, worked to gain the initiative `` heart and soul ''of the difficult task of trying to reconcile the aid and military activities, which then caused the service `` občansko-military actions'' of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was repealed in 2012, but thanks to the few French NGO a number of successes in the area of common interest and steps for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, which were involved in the number of local workers, helped to dampen the uprising: irrigation wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil and the expansion of cultivable area.
What memory after leaving after two billion military spending?
More modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for a small agricultural aid from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To these farmers freed from the uprising led by foreign groups, they wish to achieve a minor civil assistance in their favour, which would be properly controlled and touching them directly.
The difficulty of the work on the egyptian constitution
President Mohammad Mursí turned to another poker.
While Egypt remains in its history, the most divided over the declaration of the Constitution, which temporarily grants unlimited powers, he decided to play a hunch.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of the views of all the other day that the Constituent Assembly approved the final text.
Less than a week ago granted a head of state to the House for a further two months to complete the necessary work.
For nearly two years, Egypt, used a makeshift text, which was often supplemented, which undermines the constitutional stability of the country and leads to a legal argument.
This new initiative will only further strengthen the ambivalence of the country.
From the point of view of the opposition to the president remains in its `` autokratickém delirium '', `` violates its word ''and `` trample on the right.''
His supporters, however, assert that the means, how quickly turn with the constitutional and political crisis and accelerate the process of transition.
In two weeks, there should be a referendum.
It is a very short period of time, which would force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text of the Egyptians to clarify the article after article.
For the president, it is also a way of again achieving national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country rocked by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with US Weekly, Tim, Muhammad Mursí appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
Especially because this hastily organized vote puts the egyptian people with an ultimatum: `` either approve my text, or have unlimited powers '', which otherwise would have after the approval of a new constitution to end.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday 85 members of the Constituent Assembly approved the text with a large majority of islamists.
Most liberals in the vote.
In mid-November, not long before the publication of the Constitution, slamming the door with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to make their views.
Defenders of human rights, civil society or religious minorities in their step.
In order to achieve a quorum, was yesterday morning hastily added 11 persons from among the replacements.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Surprising, then, that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
Commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few dispute that day around … an hour for prayer, when some members of the Committee argued that the clock in the boardroom are not properly adjusted.
The text voted yesterday evening, consisting of 234 articles.
The subject of the limelight, article 2, remains at the same version of the 1971 constitution, and provides that `` the principles of sharia are the main source of law ''.
The Salafi party, for which the introduction of islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoping to replace the term `` principles ''the term `` rules '', which would allow the stricter application.
For the Islamists, again, the fact that this article was corrected, a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of egyptian society.
`` Hypocrisy '', say the liberals, who sees it as a problem.
According to them, because the Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
Focusing in particular Article 220, which confers al-Azhar University in an advisory role, in particular for the control of compliance with sharia law.
According to the expert on Egypt, Sophie Pommierové it is disconcerting, because `` people summoned expressions are chosen and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this as the beginning of theocracy. ''
Liberals fear more stirring up the fact that the next president of the university should be less moderate than the present.
`` For the moment, there was no particular religious result.
With the Constitution, Egypt remains the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, not ulamové, but university officials, many of them trained in french schools, ''tempered by concerns about Alexis Blouet, who work on the constitutional transition in Egypt.
Agrees, however, that `` there may be differences on the interpretation of Article 220, because it used terms belong to the religious.
There is a particular reference to `` fiqh'[islamic jurisprudence, red].
And in the future may occur, the question of the extent to which the civilian judges are competent to express themselves. ''
Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious site very criticised because of the enhanced powers granted by the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared to the old regime.
Another controversial place: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the leaders of the army will not be the verification of the defence budget by Parliament, but the National Defense Council.
Further, he will not be in the military court banned the proceedings with civilians, as requested by the protection of human rights.
These associations in connection with the text, which is directed against the freedom of its misgivings.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult continues to be disabled, which could have serious consequences for the freedom of expression, especially for the press.
No article in addition to address the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayefová of Human Rights Watch.
It's the only positive point of the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the egyptian president had last night in a televised speech, this afternoon's rallies are planned.
Supporters of the head of state will manifest on Saturday.

`` The great and powerful, ''says into Moscow: emigrants he will save money on the tongue
While the members and human rights defenders still debate about the law on compulsory language tests in the country had already appeared fraudsters who sell `` counterfeit certificates ''
In Moscow, St Petersburg and other russian cities comes every year 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan Turkménie.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On 1 December came into force in law, under which each migrant workers will be required to pass a test of knowledge of the russian language.
Yet this rule applies only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and local economy, lifestyle, and retail sales.
The FMS, however, promises that the time will be the appropriate tests obligatory for all visitors.
The tests, however, will consist of linguistic knowledge, but also of russian history and the foundations of the law.
Knowledge of the language, it will also be necessary to confirm and extend to obtain a work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the Russian is the official language.
This law, not even the people who successfully managed to reach the attestation and obtain academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits, the conviction and the protection of rights
The network test sites will work under the auspices of the Institute of Puškinova russian language, University of friendship between the peoples of the Moscow State University, State University in St. Petersburg and other russian universities.
Migrants can pass tests in all cities; today in Russia is open to more than 160 such centres.
The initiative to promote the introduction of testing also supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders, many in the press to ask the question: what in fact it will bring?
What changes to know the language for the Russians and the visitors?
Above all, the representatives of the migration service will enable it to reduce the number of people who have suffered as a result of the `` slave labor. ''
Now many people talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, explains the chairman of the board of the FMS Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be initiated prior to their departure.
The only system will allow organized recruitment from 90% to solve the problems of the foreign workers.
The problems arise for immigrants without the profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without the knowledge of the language - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Sebelev says with conviction is the future migrant sentenced to clashes with nepoctivými people who, under the pretext of assistance to ensure `` the removal order ''into nightmare, cramped quarters, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, languish for months without food and documents and toil for 12 to 14 hours a day.
From our migrant workers receiving many complaints.
`` In their homeland, they promise, but after the arrival of them get cheated, seize them passports, paid the promised wages, ''confirms the Chief of the Tajik government labour migration MS Tolib Sharipov.
Swearing!
Less that many citizens of the central asian republics, who intended to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to get to, but they do not have the experience, even with the work.
Of course, it's not their fault, but rather a disaster: very few, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks, can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
`` Their families need something also feed the kids, not to mention the fact that it should be a decent dress, shoes on and equip the school.
As children grow into productive age, must be at the first opportunity to go to work.
Without the knowledge of the language, it's hard to hate.
`` You feel the humiliation and inferior. ''
It is true that, with regard to the law on language tests indicate the defenders of human rights on the one important thing.
The testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If it is not, so they will not pass exams, or do not get another official job.
In the meantime, most migrant workers as in Russia illegally.
`` Welcome, or unauthorised entry '
Many of the immigrant workers, says that to obtain official status in our country is not easy.
The reason-bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
In addition, the money-laundering: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
But the false registration can be obtained quickly and just one and a half thousand.
The staff of the russian police know that we are essentially false documents, without authorization, of cases of extortion.
`` Require a hundred, two cigarettes, tea, ''- he shared with reporters about his experience, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Chuškadamov.
`` Well, do not be stingy, buy a painting. ''
On the first day of the validity of the law on the tongue, they found that the false documents are not only of migrants.
Employees of the FMS already confiscated several fraudulent certificates of completion of the linguistic test.
Falsified documents are printed on a color printer.
Of course, the new owners have free: each of the migrants in the hope that he will facilitate the problem with the judge tests, paid for this document seven thousand roubles.
It is two and a half times higher than the amount of pre-requisite official test: it will become a migrant workers three thousand roubles.
The main task of the immediate future is secure system from corruption to workers could simply buy the documents, in that match, government officials and human rights defenders.
The government can not promise to foreign workers who do the tests for the first time, the necessary time to get the course the foundations of the russian language.
For the visitors, who can not russian, are expected to work in the areas in which they require active with people.
The MVD (Ministry of the Interior) takes the circulation of the illegal market with weapons
The share of crime, with the use of a legally held weapons is very low
The MVD Russia presents a proposal to tighten the law in relation to the owners of the civil weapons.
It is the reaction of the government on the recent event: the stimulus of the cases were shooting at weddings, dispensed with the victims of the massacre, and prepared Moscow lawyer Dmitri Vinogradovem, as a result of which seven people died.
The police wants to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age at which can obtain a licence to carry weapons-from 18 to 21 years.
This supports the idea of the head of the Duma's committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarovaja, who promised that changes the Weapons Act will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the russian state authorities try to deal with the problem of the way `` the teasing screws. ''
The network appeared in an open letter, which the authors-representatives of various social shooting organisations-demanding refusal `` modest tightening of the law. ''
The percentage of templi registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and a criminologist, in an interview with the Russian BBC newsroom.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior was for six months of the year 2012 142 committed crime of using firearms registered by the authorities of the Ministry of the Interior, while for the same period was committed a total of 1168 thousands of crime.
The authors of the open letter are convinced a tightening of legislation in the area of civil weapons cause the perpetrators, the `` black market ''.
According to their words today can be found in Moscow any weapon at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior, says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers from plants for officers:
`` Black market ''with weapons is supplied by a few channels.
The main channel is five, says the retired colonel Victor Baraněc, who worked for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot pages, which receive orders weapons
The first of them - `` the army or the military route '', it means the gun, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
`` Stealing weapons and russian officers and kavkazané themselves, ''says Baraněc.
Another type of `` black ''weapons are weapons stolen criminals for representatives of the security forces.
Baranec explains that include stealing from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from the staff of the law enforcement authorities in criminal proceedings.
`` Illegal ''comes into the sale of military depots.
In many military depots are often the explosions.
`` There is evidence that some of the fires were deliberately-to hide manka, ''says a former soldier.
My contribution to bring words Barance both arms manufacturers.
`` In private firms currently zbrojařské, which are not competitive on the international market, and discarded weapons, which supplies on the black market, including Moscow, ''says this expert.
Another source of `` black ''of the market's smuggling.
Separately, a large number of pistols and vending machines from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
`` There's their production, sometimes the weapons produced in small-scale production, and the Mafia, which organized their smooth production, ''says a former soldier.
Where's the weapon?
Experts count, what is the approximate percentage of the various sources of supply of illegal weapons to the `` black market ''.
A report on this issue has wrought in 2011, the centre of the analysis of problems and the design of public administration.
Specialists dismantled the statements of the Ministry of Interior and the russian Statistical Office kriminologickou literature and data from public data portals focusing on the issues of weapons.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, state investigators, comes from the military and the executive.
Half of all weapons on the black market `` the fault of the officials, whose work is associated with weapons, ''says the report.
According to the data, which are available to researchers, from 17% of the armed conflict, in 14% of cases to the theft of weapons in their manufacture, 5% is `` black archaeology ''.
- Prodavač Konzultant one of the shops with weapons, who asked to place his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the black `` archaeologists dig ''long ago nobody buys-are just too old.
Often, he says, the vendors drive for new shipments directly into military depots.

`` That would take her to the city, and it sells for 900 euros a piece with two magazines, ''he says.
`` The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and therefore whenever they will burn plan in objasněnosti crime, control the purchase for traders with illegal weapons, ''he adds.
`` As a luxury in the store, ''
The seller is with the buyer typically found each other over their friends.
I visited websites and blogs, until he found the man, who offered me the opportunity to go on a platform of `` test '', where he will be the man who led me to the `` corner '', where they will act.
The price of mainly I learned there
The military correspondent Victor Baraněc
If I want to get the gun, I need someone who knows the way out, tells the salesman - - - - - - - - - - - - - - that I have known adviser. but fully distrusted him.
Sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, `` hypothetically from Mr Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that her daughter lost a tooth. ''
And now I get there over a man, I am sure.
He also says the only me, because he knows I inform him.
Beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldier Victor Baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid 1990 s, when processed essay of publication on this subject.
Schemes in his words changed.
They gave him the album with photographs, where it was `` all about what you think. ''
`` I felt like a luxury in the store, ''he recalled the soldier.
The buyer, in the words of Baraněce, offer a pig in a poke-everything you can try.
I, a potential client, just buy-let's go with the seller into the forest and to build a target.
`` Give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I became convinced that the gun shooting well, we are starting to act, ''describes the expert.
The magazine on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet, you will bring to websites and groups to `` Vkontaktu '', where the offers to purchase the weapons `` for various purposes ''.
It is not needed no documents or face-to-face meetings.
`` You only need to have a specified amount of money, ''says the headline in the advertising on the website of the `` buy a gun battle or machine.''
In these pages, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
And the sale of minor?
`` Of course, without a licence, ''asks the user `` Ivan'' (spelling is preserved).
`` I will buy the TT. Moscow ''- briefly formulates requirement `` Fedorenkov.''
The Federal Security Service recently threw out the vast network of shell websites and the person who wish to buy a military weapon, grabbing a shovel.
People are running as the hungry fish bait and then captured the coal in Siberia.
The military correspondent and a senior military official Victor Baraněc
I have heard of such schemes: Web pages are usually registered beyond the scope of the russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer the payment through an ATM.
`` In response to this, the seller will send his photograph and description with the guidelines where the gun is hidden, ''said a spokesman for the NGO `` right to gun Dmitriy Kislov.''
Victor Baraněc confirms that, after entering the order on the website, you can stay without a weapon, and wind up behind bars.

Makarov for 100
In the purchase of an illegal firearm pay according to experts estimate the amount usually from 100 to 900 dollars.
In the words of Dmitri Kislova from the NGO law `` gun ''a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month for up to one and a half months.
The weapon was dispatched from stores for long-term storage depots through the middle.
According to the official Statistical Office declined compared with the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia for a total of 7%, and 22.9 thousands of cases, and the number of cases of theft and explained the blackmail of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices declined by 7.8%.
In the US, the workers are on strike and supermarkets fastfoodů
The work on the desk of establishments `` McDonald'goes up to a quarter of all teenagers.
In the last few days in America, a wave of protests against low wages in the hypermarkets company Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as the `` McDonald, ''``Burger King,''` `Taco Bell,''`` Wendy's'' and `` Kentucky Fried Chicken. ''
So far, no one can predict whether this wave transformed into a wave of nine, or whether she is destined to disappear soon.
This whole share support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the increase in the humble, rank-and-file workers receive ​platů at Wal-Mart and the systems of the fast food, the aim is to achieve the organisers of the protests in the creation of their unions.
Currently this economic sector virtually untouched odborářským movement.
46 cents a year?
Events began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called `` Black Friday '', when America struck an orgy of low-priced sales, by millions of people and, in some cases, is accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some staff company Walmart, in which the world is working on the 2.2 million people abandoned their workplace and demonstrated together with the trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals chains, which are intended to be people from the lower and middle classes.
Walmart sells around the world, everything from diapers over hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers' stores in Walmart purchases only in his work.
The availability and the range of goods made from a chain of Walmart, one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of the critics, he can not afford to sell their goods Walmart so cheap, partly because few pay their staff.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic or manual scanners.
The demonstrators on `` Black Friday ''called for an increase in salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies increased sharply from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical worker Walmart receives 9.5 dollars an hour, but it does not match the height of expenditure, say staff.
Scientists from the University of California, Berkeley, shows that, if Walmart will increase the average wage to $12 an hour, it will be a company of 3.2 billion dollars a year.
It's an average of 1.1% more than the company spent on salaries now.
If the company Walmart moves wage increases fully on the shoulders of the consumer, each visit to the store only 46 cents more.
For the year as customers spend approximately 12, 39 dollars more than today.
Walmart's defenders point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
`` Black Friday ''stores in the company from 8 o'clock on Thursday until the middle of the following day, and during this time the company Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
Overall, its cash carried out the `` Black Friday ''almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the company's Dan Fogelman said in an interview for the left-wing investor website Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of `` less than five ''employees of Wal-Mart, and that the protest was all `` another media sensation '', organised by trade unions.
`` Vacant Treasury! ''
The protests continued this week in New York, where their aim was malls Walmart (those in pokrokovém town are too popular, and therefore there are almost), but `` McDonald'and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that sells billions of rations, and then you will not pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the State of New York, $7.25 an hour.
This Fastfoodové restaurant wage increase gradually, but only slightly, and the average receive their rank-and-file workers in New York 8,90 dollars an hour.
In this expensive city, no one has a lower wage.
Well, I do not see how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
`` McDonald's employment u ''through nearly a quarter of american teenagers who work behind the counter after school on a part-time basis and live with their parents.
Few people in that sees its main source of livelihood or planned to stay there for a long time.
Currently, constantly meet in an interview with the staff of `` McDonald ', who complain that they must live on the money, and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, a forum on the Wall Street Journal hanging comment, in which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began at 6: 30 in the morning on Thursday at McDonald's, ''``the 40 th Street and Madison Avenue, demanding that the cashiers and cooks in the fast-food started to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice their current minimum wage.
Also, demanding that the fast food were based on the trade unions.
American laws prohibit the administration to prevent the creation of trade unions and punish activists, trade union movement harassment and redundancies.
From the other side, they rarely facilitates the management of life.
Introduced in the fast-food trade union, however, is difficult even for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is unusually high turnover of staff.
Opposition
On this day, held noisy protests in a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of that action was at noon at the gathering at the `` McDonald's ''near Times Square, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Jumaane Williams, who said: `` McDonald,'' says that sells billions of rations, and then you will not pay benefits and pay you properly for your hard work! ''
The demonstrators were also support other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the city of Bill de Blasio, who said that `` we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve a fair reward for their work and economic prosperity, he deserves every New Yorker! ''
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest events of its kind in the history of american sphere of fast food.
But it took part in only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event happens to be the spark that ignites the flame of a mass movement, is still unclear.
`` We have managed to deceive the brain, on average, ''
Among fans of modern technology of virtual reality is trending topic augmented reality; recently, it means to perceive the world through the prism of the particular special glasses.
At the start of the summer, at its annual conference showed Google working model of this news and in November, it was announced that the request for the patent also submitted by Microsoft.
From an interview with the leader of the group of interactive 3 d technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Šaramem Izadim shows that for scientists, this company are spectacles of the past.
Tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, the creation of a virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us, in general, what your research group?
- We are dealing with human interactions with machines, but at the same time, we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity has stuck in stage work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes touching the screen with his finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors-this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect sensors, because for all is a very interesting possibility management using gestures.
- What is ahead of us in the future?
- Despite the fact that the Kinect system also act on a physical level, very much interaction is still ongoing on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.
The flow of information to improve the system (adopting more data), but the flow of output so far, not particularly.
We are trying to change it, we are actually three-dimensional imaging systems at the various technologies including projektivních.
It should allow the computer world into our physical world, making him reálnějším.
For this purpose, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in much better shape.
And in the first place-to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think of the vocal control?
It's a popular thing, but not exaggerate?
Surely it can not be considered as a panacea-raises the issue of privacy, because they do not always want to inform others in our neighborhood on their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for control of the device in public places, we had a project in which we thought about the gestures, but not on the vast, only such skoupých, short.
Gestures while nesnímala camera equipment, but the bracelet, which followed the movements of bone and muscle.
So far, it's big, but in theory it can reduce the size of the wristwatch.
In general, however, that the future is the type of control, such as a gesture of + voice.
- How's that?
- Ask me how, for example, to give you this can of soda?
You say it, and at the same time you show.
I usually just speak.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to detect.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the moment in the can or can not machine?
- It is not necessary, but it's mutual alignment.
I think that, in the near future, we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that can accurately detect human reactions.
It may, for example, be laser scanners, which provide a good in-depth distinction, that's very important.
- If you have to talk about his work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements of the modern cameras?
Today is not sufficient distinction, depth, or something else?
Basically, the current generation-that's what we are reflected in our work on the three-dimensional detection.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels speed of 1000 f / S.
But it is not just the very megapixels, but as a matrix and depth.
When you look at things are all current technologies are inadequate for us-it seems to be the work of the designers of the algorithms.
So we have to remember not only the distinctions in axes X and Y, but also the Z.
So very important is also the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, are a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond did dotykový scanner with adjustable delays in the processing of 1 to 100 ms, while the current, mass-produced sensors are closer to the other value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands how much it affects the human interaction with the machine.
For me, the work was very useful equivalent of such a device, but I do not need so many touches, but I need some images per second.
- And increasing the number of cameras is necessary?
- In the Kinect system are now used three `` camera '', one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second-set of the reflected signal.
And the longer the camera-it's actually a common sensor visible zone.
It is used to determine the depth of the object.
A larger number of cameras, it could potentially solve the problem …
Or worse, because it would have increased the necessary volume carried out the calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect analog system, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras, and see how it will help in determining a three-dimensional position.
If I remember right, Microsoft (unlike Google) making public their glasses.
You do not think that, in terms of the day-to-day use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, walk and constantly while holding smatphone in uplifted hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be `` portable ''form of the extension of the reality, which can be based on the platform at any time from the clouds to switch on his smartphone, design and on display around.
The glasses-it's a very personal device, it is their strength (private things you only see you), and at the same time the weakness of augmented reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of the virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in `` Iron Man '', but also the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which critics often point: there is no touching response!
Hands felt nothing!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- Their lectures often say that augmented reality-it's the seventh after walking a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the addition of the tactile well could become the eighth of a breakthrough.
Yet used one of the interesting tricks-the use of second hand as a kind of background for display.
An excellent way records depressing!
But there are also technologies that are really focused on adding tactility of these `` images in the air ''- for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beam in the defined point the finger, raises the touch-world feeling, but it's still very weak-as if he blew on his fingertips.
There is also the bracelet on his wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers-also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that he can feel it, what seems to be the moment to feel when he sees something?
- It's a good idea, we have not tried.
Here comes another challenge, which will fight for a long time-as a man who is physically located in a very tight space, to believe that walks in an open, virtually infinite space-we are also working on the concept of cross-country trails (not at all like the clubs), moving platform and also big balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes the order, so is the work of many years.
That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers-many things is in full.
Instead of Vkusovština culture-Rosbalt ru.
`` Rosbalt ''is a continuation of the project, `` avant-garde '', on the people who are in the lead, are avantgardou art and culture.
At the top of the list were already significant figures of the art scene in St Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often located recognition in Europe, without reaching all reputation.
The new hero of `` Rosbaltu ''is an amazing artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller-bearded man, who is dressed all in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here in the summer garden, here in the chic bars and vernisážích.
The images of Cyril Miller, wherever they are exposed, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of a purely social and filozofických petrohradských storytellers, creators of new mythology.
Cyril Miller-it's a striking man of Saint Petersburg avant-garde by the end of the 1980 s and early 1990 s.
In addition, the city is a man, his appearance on the streets raises a smile on the face of all citizens, increases in the mood.
Recently, he picked up an organ and became petrohradským flašinetářem because of this complex role is ripe with his entire life, philosophy and bohémským image.
- Cyril, so why go after the city all in red and not in yellow or, for example, in a turquoise?
- I chose the color red as a designer of light and image.
In this world, a red color is a compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although it is generally recognised that it was all just a little different from the grey, aggression and bad qualities.
But my provocations are geared to bind the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative acts is primarily an invitation to the debate.
- And when you understand that, you have to be an artist?
- On display in the house on něvském culture, where they were exposed to my work.
I understood what is my way.
Then came a wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free of the artists I could not understand.
I was friends with artists, with a new wave of post-gazoněvskými, who brought us to the `` puškinské 10 '', and further waves.
That brings me to the theatre, dressing, the music of all genres, the addition of the word.
- And it's all merged in your art at the clinic-for me it was important to find himself in the centre of the culture of St Petersburg, where they should collect all the best powers of creativity.
In 1995, I took place at puškinské 10, and there still existed before the reconstruction of the hudebně - art club, the bohemian club, the home of the petěrburkské bohemia.
There is that much: NOM Tequila, jazz, do not forget, as Šnura brought the project `` ear Van Gogh ''.
Šnur and his friends sang under the plywood light song, they dressed in full-length leotards, midway between the dowager's composer Igor, who is now in vogue.
When the band began to play live, became `` Leningradem ''.
Trachtenberg led many programmes that-galivských times.
We gave them Trachtěnberga, began his great career, basic education and training from us.
Gallery `` D '', `` Griboedov 137 club-that's the aftermath of Art Clinic.
This way they left our workers and patrons.
I am a hero of the last century, when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was held in the press, the special price was `` people in our city. ''
The nomination of `` Artist of the year ''was appointed, I ended my peak.
In the new times under the old rules is the work of an uncomfortable, I am a man of truth, integrity, and the culture of the last century.
In recent years, it's easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not too much.
- Your works are characterised by an identifiable way.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - That many of my paintings are hits, in which is vividly captured timeliness and pervasiveness.
I will have the program, the exhibition `` russian museum in the clowns you are a ''.
Clowns are nadčasovou category.
Before, I used to be a social, and today it's painful and horrible.
But in the clowns you are a everything blurs, scanning the tragedy.
I love the slapstick, get the grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through the totalitarian disguise in nařizovacím Procedure.
Today people face under clothing, through the external drive, not the inner man.
Or maybe he can not shake his hand and spit in his face.
And the trick will be removed to change.
- We have recently seen you in the role of the town's organ-grinder. - cultural town should have such a hero.
And who would it be if I did not?
- And it may be commercial art fair?
Today should be commercial, utility art in-depth, gentle, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
Before the people assembled in clumps, La Boheme loved one, ordinary people.
Today everything broke on mikrospolečnosti today, it's very hard to please everyone.
I am not 100 bill to like it all.
Today is to think about whom he likes.
Today everyone has a cultural hero of their 100 fans.
- And the Stasu Michajlova comes several thousand spectators!
- The fans come, there are sexually involved the social sphere.
And the cultural ground comes 300 people and 10 thousand of them coming, and the result is less management, money, everything away.
I have the fans, the main point is that no one was fooled and violates what is established.
When I was young, I painted such images in one collector, hanging on the wall with Falkem and Larionovem.
I started with the images, which most people end.
Today, people often confuse the terms.
They say: the culture minister, consumer culture.
There is no culture of the consumer, it's ok.
I am a man of culture on the previous day, I grew up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for drawing pictures.
And I am for a culture.
- Cyril, what is the lack of St Petersburg?
- Good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: official over culture.
Not all of them, but they can deal with the culture.
The Full tsars it was in all the czars, perhaps too did not understand the culture, but understood the need to support the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In St Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are zastrčení somewhere in a corner, because they are great need experts, who correctly valued these experts and bring them on the right path.
Today prospers vkusovština.
The same Erarta, but that, frankly, they say, not all modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What's your Petěrburk?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - It's not Petěrburk Capital of Culture in Moscow culture is much more, there's the right soil.
And on our úhoru art is scarce.
We need a cultural land, but in today's writers more than readers, that's wrong.
In Europe, there are a great many people who are curious, who like to exhibitions, concerts.
For us it is just such a layer of weak.
We need to art has become fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is being implemented for the funds of the grant of St Petersburg St.
Born in the universe
The country is in danger.
Global oteplení or collisions with killer asteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earthlings on board is on the way, looking for a replacement of the planet.
To save humanity, raises the question: how to keep your house in the fall or the foster planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two planets that it is possible to acquire, even if only hypothetically.
`` It's Venus and Mars, ''says a senior researcher National Astronomical Institute P.K. Šternberga SAIŠ) (Vladimir Surdin.
But while they are on Mars better conditions for life on the surface of Venus achieve temperature 500 degrees Celsius.
It's possible to live only in the high altitude or in the orbit of Venus … in the universe.
Addressing the issues of reproduction in the universe, scientists began with the flora.
Already half a century ago were conducted experiments on the plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit is no different from the Earth's relatives.
It was then carried out rendered insects in orbit-very little fruit fly Drosophila.
In 1979, was sent into space quails eggs, to check on the progress of the embryo in microgravity.
The output of getting absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
`` The problem is that this bird must find support to stand on its own feet and start to move, ''says the lab director of the Institute of biomedical problems (IBMP) Ran Vladimir Syčev.
If they can not find support, the birds chaotically fall and somersault.
After 10 hours in a freshly vylíhnutých birds to total extinction instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or noise.
And the problem was that, within four days just died.
`` We let the birds to emerge, but then we refused because there is simply impossible to work with them, ''says the failure of the experiment with the chickens in the universe, Vladimir Syčev.
The last `` miniarcha ''with animals flew into orbit for 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
In `` biosatelitu Bion ''but only beings one sex.
The experiment with rats who were broadcast into space already gravidní.
In essence, they found nothing supernatural.
`` It was just the biosatelitech, but again, this is a unique experiment and such experiments to be carried out, ''says Vladimir Syčev.
After landing on Earth Space rats born offspring.
Approach to the problem of reproduction directly in the universe, however, has so far failed.
It's a difficult task.
The animals at the loss of a normal environment simply can not realise their sexual instincts.
The man, unlike the animals, in principle.
Homo sapiens rules abstract thinking and is able to create the appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons similar experiments carried out.
But the women fly into space for over 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Těreškovové.
The most precious thing that humanity has, it is a woman's body.
Our Chalka flew off and no one on the ground, he could not tell whether the last flight into space.
Whether he can deliver a baby after a flight.
`` This question still unanswered, ''says veteran-raketově space sector Vakhtang Vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first woman-cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The child's father was also a spaceman Andriyan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of second-born wife Svetlana kosmonautce Savické, which visited orbit twice and also worked in an open space.
The risk, however, remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, after years of born and grow healthy offspring.
`` Moreover, it can be dangerous in the orbital years, ''states the spaceman-pilot, the hero of the Soviet Union and the hero of Russia's Valery Polyakov.
Humanity still must inevitably seek new ways in the field of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
CPK Hydrolaboratoř stage is a mandatory training to fly.
Here in the conditions with zero gravity astronauts to acquire habits needed to work in an open space.
The water mimics the weightlessness.
Though for adults is the water even comfortable, but in its own way, a strange environment for young children is a natural element.
Short ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on Earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between that child is located in an average of 9 months in her mother's place-its and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, it's logical, because from the moment of birth, since that first a bath, expire only 2 weeks.
`` It's very little for the child to something forgotten, ''says instructor swimming newborns Aksenovová Marina.
In short, if it is for the new-born baby weightlessness natural state, then, for the women's natural inevitable gravity, the force of gravity.
In the weightlessness occurs very quickly to chřadnutí abdominal muscles, the muscles of the pelvis, dropping the body's ability to drive the foetus.
It can leave aside, if they will work stimulators muscle activity in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth took place in a special chamber, in which the body's mother, forcing the fetus.
`` What next? ''asks Valeri Polyakov complex issues.
On the other hand, the baby also needs the artificial gravity.
If not for the organism gravity, not form a skeleton or set of muscles.
Born in orbit, it is not possible to dress like an adult into a special suit with the coach.
Just be deprived of what it needs to develop unconditionally.
`` If you go into the experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a strange environment, we will bring the country to a disabled person, that would be totally nepřizpůsobená this environment, ''predicts the head of the Commission for Bioethics IBMP Ran Igor Pestov.
So the babies in the universe today is just a theoretical question.
But when the time came to become a reality, and when the earth issue in their ships on a distant planet, which will become the home of their offspring born in space.
The chief OWL švarcsystému failed because politicians control:
The Czech Republic has in connection with the public good-and high quality legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview for Hejl says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav Kala.
`` The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in his application-that's what we are missing in my opinion, ''says the current situation of Kala.
Similar findings also suggest the joint control of the czech and german inspectors.
As an example of the improper practice provides access to the so-called `` Petr Nečas švarcsystému ''.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the app entrepreneur will not bother his checks-is therefore illegal or legal?
`` The law must not be somehow set, and if anything, so you do not, the Prime Minister can not prevent in the work of the Office, which has a duty to walk, monitor and enforce the obligations, ''says Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Commons, you are talking about a joint project between the czech and german party, which was compared to the legislation on public contracts in both countries.
What was specifically?
The parallel control that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it means that a european legislation regulates how the public address, followed by is the individual national legislation and then also the very practice.
We are all in this together, and even if the check is not yet closed, showed us a very interesting differences-generally speaking, the legislation is with us, maybe even `` more and more sophisticated '', however, the practice is in some parameters better in Germany.
Thus, it is confirmed that it is not enough to create in the more precise rules, but there is a need to engage in the application of the law.
Do you actually this project can help him for you?
Just such a joint control could contribute to stop efforts to precise laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, if it did not have a positive impact.
The economy means to obtain the proper thing for a reasonable (which does not always the lowest price), to avoid the enrichment and, where appropriate, for criminal activities.
But by reducing the limit, it does not need to be achieved.
Maybe it was a system with a `` paper '', that those who want to look for holes in the system, so they will draw a much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transfer of the legislation on public procurement into practice.
How the system works in Germany?
There is a similar to our office OWL, or it's otherwise?
The authorities, as the OWL Bundesrechnungshof works there, which is organized as we also has a college, only makes a slightly different way, but in principle, both authorities doing likewise.
Also, the powers are to some extent similar, however, that Germany has the Federal arrangements, so has the auditors, even at the level of the Länder-in that system is a bit different from our own.
BRH can only control the federal money, represented by the state resources.
Public funds, which are managed by the counties and municipalities, control the level of federal auditors.
What's the legislation, so it's easier than ours?
In general, without specific data like comparing, however, in some respects, Germany is described as a model, but I can not say that everything is better.
It is therefore also have better supervisors?
Certainly not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
But I must say that both countries as a model, faced with a wide range of problems.
Otherwise, they could not be any value in cooperation with our office, no?
In terms of domestic legislation, for your office meant the amendments to the law on public procurement, and there are already some of its effects?
Whereas the validity of this novel is relatively short, so we have not yet in control events.
Because we are doing checks, needs to be reckoned with some delays.
Seeing it only in the process of preparing future checks-we started our new instrument `` detection of risk '', through which we inefficiencies through almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them-there are those changes, of course, will show, because they change the limits, the conditions of some types of competition will be adjusted and the like.
The approval of this law, then consider the more valuable, or further burden on red tape?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will.
The problem, which may arise that those rules `` tighten ''and will not be able to follow them.
Now for the operation of the previous rules are controlled by people committed to the provider (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes Regional Council) to every non-compliance with the law on public procurement means of budgetary discipline.
So has the price of the law in this way made?
I do not think that in this way.
The system must exclude those who want him to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit the formal misconduct, which does not have an impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
How so?
Let's show the way.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the app entrepreneur will not bother checks that the so-called `` švarcsystému ''- and what does it mean?
Švarcsystém is illegal or legal?
The law must not be somehow set, and if anything, so you do not, the Prime Minister can not prevent in the work of the Office, which has a duty to walk, monitor and enforce the obligations.
You could say: `` change the law and allow it '', but it can not say that we do, nothing like that.
The law on public contracts are fairly strict rules, as what is to be formally made-which is right to protect the competition.
But on the other hand it is tragic, as the candidate with the best offer is excluded for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but must be correct in his application-that's what we are missing in my opinion.
The roads are passable, but most places namrzlé
A few places on the Czech Republic roads are namrzlé and snow-covered.
Most of the roads are passable, but somewhere with caution.

Simon Ornest: concerts to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about that, in less than a month to come to an end of the world?
It's just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to catch.
Together with the band the Tap Tap from doing rather fun, and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent him from the end of the world.
In December, moreover, will hold a totally unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
You can imagine him closer to readers?
The national fund-raiser, which we plan for the past two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the mayan calendar declared on December 21 at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, 20 December 21 hours from the same place 3 concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is the time zone for 12 hours before us, Maya calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was about my idea, then we are all out with our art director John Augusta.
In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want together with the public to think about the condition of the once this world to our children.
At the end of the mayan calendar, we also created a unique collection of objects of shoes, t-shirts, bags or original germ against the end of the world whose purchase at www. e-tap. com people can also support.
A group of the Tap Tap, together with other interprety also sang the anthem of the so-called against the end of the world, which is called `` the end of the world canceled ''.
Today is very popular on YouTube, also on these benefičních concerts?
Of course, in the very end, if we do everything and the end of the world is …
Sing it all artists on all three concerts in parallel.
Anthems suddenly link also in a unique live coverage on tv.
The words to the song he wrote and the main role of Jesus in the video plays Thomas Hanak, sings in her also Xindl X …
How do you get them to cooperate?
We are also working with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, whereas we are having a lot of benefičních events and concerts.
We are trying to be heavily involved in such projects.
It turned out that the majority of cooperation with us interests and enjoy.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
The equipment accessible training centre, which had Studeo sixth year implement with civic associations, TAP in Jedlička's Institute for the Handicapped.
The schools regularly Jedličkova Institute instructors and engaged in activities that they enjoy and interests.
The students themselves do not have the funds to the lecturers set ourselves, we try to allow it in this way.
In the context of the construction of the Jedličkova Institute in the future there is a separate building, with this move.
Each concert out several bands and artists.
According to what you have picked them?
We tried to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague gets Chinaski, Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere, Dan Bárta, the Tap Tap, Blitz Banga and Jiří dry.
All the details may be found at www. cz. kpks.
Planning any similar `` bombastické actions ''in the future?
In May, for the first time, we will act on the Prague Spring, so here we have an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would also like to play in the czech national house in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, I'd like to link with the speech in Washington and in Chicago.
Your foreign plans are minimalistické, still have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London, or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of disabled people.
How these journeys manage logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it seems.
We have five members of the electric cart, her wheelchair must travel in the luggage compartment, with, of course, carrying a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments …
However, it is not yet always coped without problems, CSA and British Airways, to us they were well prepared, I often wonder.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was no problem.
Thanks to the výjezdům abroad can compare, differ in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.
What you have not yet met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other places where everything works better than us, we are just in Russia, we saw that in the East are all still in their infancy.
MOSCOW-Prague is very barrier, there's still, unusual for a man on the electric cart by itself in the centre of the city.
There are no such obvious as a wheelchair users prefer in the elevator.
Fortunately there arise civic associations, which try to problems for people with disabilities.
And in contrast, we still need to catch up with more advanced countries?
There's a lot of things in which we are still behind …
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always dependent on to the people concerned.
In London and Madrid is quite common, that even people with severe hendikepem separately on the public can go to the bathroom, the museum anywhere …
But it's not very common, that there are a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, are in contrast with the Tap Tap slightly ahead!
Respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, so things are going to change.
Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band the Tap Tap is currently very popular, but a few years back what you in 1998 made it?
I got a tutor to Jedličkova Institute, where I had a lot of young people who were interested in something to do.
And since I am a musician, playing the saxophone, inter alia, so I along with my colleague founded zájmový musical ring.
Well, and over time it, as our host Láďa Angelovič, a little out of hand (laughter).
But the popularity came up in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that helped us when we started to link with known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We figured we work that can not be seen, in fact, as there would be no.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, they can afford good teachers, equipment and so on.
It was your aim to go with the Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
It's crowded Showbusiness things, where one of the other models.
In a way, it's logical, all new is accepted, and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique, it's very little, but I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression for a man who sees us for the first time is, of course, a pity, it's only natural …
But the regret is totally unnecessary, because people with no hendikepem suffering from all the orphaned creatures, which we have to regret.
They are the people who can live a full life and to develop, assuming, of course, that they have the necessary funds.
I say that if something to people with hendikepem, so it's not a shift for them, but for the whole of society.
This success has helped, too, that it was a hard taskmaster, how many people you call?
If you want to do a good job, we must be in many cases, uncompromising and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion, and with his head in the clouds, and when they find out twice a week must go to the test on a product and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, so is the enthusiasm quickly leaves.
But that's not the way it works everywhere, in every group, who wants to work and who wants to achieve something.
Currently the band the Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them had its beginnings in 1998?
Only one Láďa Angelovič.
We are open to a group of people, and they can not be helped.
Who has the will and desire, has opened the door for us always
A day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 21.
In Prague, Brno Incheba areně Flédě and Ostrava plynojemu participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.

Poland and the cosmos.
In the last week at a meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, adopted in Poland for the 20 th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of the ESA, 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched its close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and over the next years participated on a number of projects.
But the path of Poland into space began much earlier.
Flights into space is devoted to the polish fans before the Second World War; but not always met with understanding.
For example, remind lecture A. Šternfelda in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, December 6, 1933, represented the thoughts of his pioneering work into space.
The idea of the young engineer (b. 1905), leaving the audience cold and after years of Šternfeld remembered that, Dr. Jan Gadomski interested in his work.
Šternfeld in 1934, gained entry into the space in France, the price of Robert Esnault-Pelterieho and André Louis Hirscha.
Dr. Jan vzpomenutý Gadomski (1899-1966) later became a big Astronomy and Space.
In polish journals published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became the world's known promoter of aerospace and his contribution was valued, and that one of the craters on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
In 1925, was built in Poland, the rail car, which should be equipped with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and unknown or the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the rocket should be used for the start-up of the mantrip or its brakes.
The information about this handcar are known only from the period of the press.
From 1933 with the rocket shells began with the polish artillery.
Research by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
Of the surviving materials, it is clear that the research concluded the prakzických stage tests.
However, the arrival of german troops research was interrupted.
In 1937, the specialist press discovered a photovoltaic Fighter rocket, designed by Rohoziński engineer and the following year out Rakieta work-torpeda powietrzna even rakietobomba lotnicza author-Leliwy Krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use rocket engines.
Just before the war was all projects the military use of missile technology gave temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which all works coordinated.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after a two-year work of his activities, ended the opening of the war.
Further work dedicated kosmonautice after the war in the polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first is the mention of society in the November edition of the class of 1954 Problemy magazine, in which there are four obsáhlejší articles devoted astronautice.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicze, a company that will address space.
At that time, it was already running projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space industry's perspective.
Since the beginning of the year 1956 polish Astronautics company (PTA) snažia entry into an international astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA has become a full member.
And in the following year, the first president of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959) became the vice-president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
This function held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA played a significant role in the development of a very successful meteorological rocket (RM Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile, which conducted the research.
The first type of vc-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred 10 October 1958.
The rocket to 1,800 feet long, about 80 cm and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Later, it was built an improved version of the vc-1 A, and in the summer of 1959, were launched in the desert flight test of the two-stage rocket, Bledovské vc-2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long, and her weight was about 5 kg.
Another development type I should be able to genuine scientific work-rocket vc-34 should have dostup up 14.5 km and its task of monitoring the height of the wind.
However, in 1962, was the further development of the suspended.
The successor to the first rocket type RM became Meteor missile-1 in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two tier, its overall length was 510 cm and starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Developed three types (marked Meteor-1 A-1 b and c-1), which varied in size space for scientific instruments.
In a rocket-Meteor 1 A was available space on the volume of 0.4 per litre, Meteor-1 B on the volume of 0.34 litre and Meteor-1 C on the volume of 0.62 litres.
The maximum ceiling for all three types of 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation Institute Meteor missile development-2, whose first flight testing began in October 1970.
The rocket-Meteor 2 should lift-off weight of 380 kg and was able to deliver a payload of 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
Subsequently, were built versions of the Meteor-2 H and Meteor-3.
Still, it is worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPARu (Committee for Space Research) in the 1960 s and the creation of the National Committee of the COSPAR two years later.
Poland is also in the programme Intercosmos involved in research into space on a soviet artificial satellites and in 1978, the polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became Vladimir Remkovi other interkosmonautem.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The resolution made public on a lively discussion.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal export-oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world, are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economic departments, national economic systems, standing in a permanent conflict between them.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free movement of unrestrained private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The influence of the significant differences between the price of labour (wages) to the price of strain.
Under this term is to understand the situation where the manufacturer is trying to import cheap goods to compete in that `` sweeps ''price competitor with a view to tear down the larger market share and increase their profits.
On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or to buy cheap, or terminated. the result is high unemployment in the countries where prices are work compared with other economies.
Because the private capital has no social responsibility and accountability for it to be produced, rising unemployment, not necessarily social spending.
The whole situation magnifies the absolute unwillingness of Lords entrepreneurs to pay taxes and replace the economic and social celospolečenské losses in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to set specific statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies create a situation in which the governments of countries are forced to enter into a mutual competition with the aim of artificially lower social level population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments give private capital to its own people, regardless of social decline.
It is mainly reflected in changes in applicable laws.
The aim is to force his own population adopted by the price of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
That's what's happening on the set of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, limiting the rights of employees in the area of employment law.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are already a number of years of public shed food for the poor, who can not feed your own work.
The number of such people are already in the millions.
In improving the competitiveness of the german economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a salary, that they must pay the breadline.
This scandal was published, even in the case of auxiliary staff of the Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all of the southern states of the EU inevitably leads to the same situation, where people are under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social level either forced to emigrate as it was in the 19 th century, or scrape for starvation wages on the edge of society in the hope that the country might lose one private equity capital.
There must be but ask where but lose?
If it's from other EU countries, then moves poverty from one country to another, or will not, because the chinese, indian, brazilian, or the Turk, Marokánec, or egyptian, or african still work for a fraction of the salary.
It applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media ad nauseam, argues that the state can not participate in the capital on their own holding that managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity, he insists, was of the opinion that the State can not control interventions to intervene in the economy.
We need to ask whether the private capital, now governed by the policy and the entire state in their own egoistickém meaning.
There is a clear answer yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually omnipresent in all states of the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation which appears in the field of corruption, the provision of mutual benefit, the legislation is virtually all reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that the ministries for lack of funds awarded the drafting of the Laws of private law firms, which are often in conjunction with the industry.
These bills are then agreed in the Bundestag.
All power as coming from people as they proclaim the Constitution of the western type, but from the financially strong groups preferujících their own interests.
It is clear that the consumer-oriented liberal democracy is now rapidly into the situation, as her Appiános describes in his book the crisis of the Roman Republic in the days of Caesar and Pompeia: ''the state had long been in complete disarray, and a man of violence.
For bribes, illegal acquisition and the stones or swords.
Podplácení and corruption flourished without any hindrance and people went to the polls in advance of the sale, with the voice of the `` noble ''… people do not apply for the office, so once was as a result of this breakdown was eight months without consuls. `` …'' began to really talk about it, that the only medicine in a bad situation is samovláda and that there is a need to choose a vigorous man.. ''he thought Appiános Pompey, but become Caesar, which changed the democracy took the self-rule.
The conclusion as in antiquity is the current company based on the reckless preference own benefit regardless of society-wide interest.
Private equity is not inherently unable to understand and apply for the benefit of society.
The result is now, as then, the unparalleled decadence elites without any attempt to reform profound.
The advent of fašistických causality and communist regimes so we have to look in the liberalisation of reckless economic systems in the 19 th and 20 th centuries.
The current state of the extinction of these systems can be in favour of a liberal democracy, considered a break with the expectations of the next round.
Especially disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignored in the future possible offences of casualties, humanitarian and social disasters, which we have already seen together with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and european level Interior will the government of the Czech Republic to continue the search for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore the system.
The solution is targeted politicko-social reforms that will strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company for the benefit of the state.

The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, inspired a lot of reactions.
One behind Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians argue racism in the State of Israel, the genocide perpetrated by the State of Israel and the palestinian arabs fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about it, who's in the periodic waves of killing the culprit and who the victim, after all, today's israeli population including samosprávných territories, born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, the sight of it, who primarily serves already 95 years of tension on the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a tiny country in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, some of them based on the basis of my own understanding, or a group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily in the history of the struggle for power.
In every age, we can trace a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is if it were always these personalities, completely autonomously guided by their actions and or whether their throne was someone who guided their actions to advance the goal of vytýčenému.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few, and that this concentration of money and from the resulting power could occur in the life of a generation.
Between those astronomically rich families out one, which could be considered as head of octopus (if someone standing over them, I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - Rothschieldové.
Many of them say.
Of course.
The first press agency (Reuters) bought already in the 1990 s, the 19 th century to mortgage given his name with highly criminal acts, in the background against which they stood for them always meant to consolidate power, to increase the wealth, or both.
A key shares in almost all of the central banks of the world and against countries, where shares in a central bank have kept or preparing for war (before the attack in Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after attacking Iraq was 5 countries after the overthrow of Gaddafi's only four, but in the meantime, Russia is subject to the central bank, the russian government).
Whoever this family tried to resist, he died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Central Bank Rothschieldově Bank of America began during the civil war to issue its own (government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, was assassinated in 1963, a member of the Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, after the Fed wanted to sue for the start of the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for a global power led in 1859-1871 to formulate a plan of three of the world wars Freemason Supreme, 33 to forgo the Albert Pike.
The first task was to remove the great monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial estate in Great Britain and the third has lead to a reduction of the world's population somewhere to 0.5-1 billion people (such as many slaves for their comfort and luxury enough and consume so many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is none other than the glacis for such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method, the group of the richest families in the forehead with Rothschieldy works by the invocation of the crisis and the subsequent offering resolution (order ab-chao order out of chaos).
These solutions are false, and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, to avoid a repetition of the crisis, as the one that created in 1907).
So, after they managed to slaughter habsburského heir to the throne-U R Ferdinand in Sarajevo to unleash the first world war, destroyed the czarist Russia running the Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified, the surrender of Germany (they were no longer needed for the war for the destruction of Imperial Russia) and subsequently the fragmentation of the Central Powers, Austria, Hungary.
To facilitate the start of World War II left bankers policy to create a latent conflict situation that Germany had imposed huge war reparations, which created a presumption of radicalisation's impoverished masses, and then they just slip the Germans sufficiently strong, designating the culprits and simple solutions offering leader and the creation of the multi-ethnic Czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, which should play, and also played a role, the fifth column, the ignition, the war of the fire.
At the end of the 19 th century sparked Rothschieldové exhibit the Zionist movement, which one branch sought the creation of the jewish state, preferentially in the historic area of Judea, with Jerusalem as the capital (a return to Zion).
Already the Balfourova Declaration, a prerequisite for mass immigration jews to Palestine, became the first clashes with the local arab population.
The terrorist attacks took place on both sides.
The outbreak of World War II, if Hitler plucked from the chain, which at first international bankers held, or what it was made in the plan is difficult to estimate, but the suffering of european jews in concentration camp created a prerequisite for the acceptance of the jewish state of the global community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and like it was war reparations Germany to 2. World War, the announcement of the State of Israel was created on the outbreak of war in the third.
If it succeeds, it will be the international bankers to unleash the jewish nation, like in the second, the victim in the front line of the fighting, now jointly with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only in the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided people the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in palestinsko-israeli conflict, where the injustice breeds of injustice in the endless chain of violence, as the beginning of all was the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, decided to international bankers to people the choice in the election exclusively own candidates.
The current Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel's Hawk is a typical example of fašizujícího, to international bankers loyal, policy, which is doing everything it can to start a war with Iran, which would have given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), threatening to escalate into a global conflict and to control Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, which travels 20% of all of the world's oil (corridor is just 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what now seems words came David Rockefeller in 1994: `` all we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order. ''
A new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population serves the comfort of a handful of financial aristocracy.
The world, where everyone is newly born individual implanted in the birth of the chip, which will make it totally controlled.
`` A force all the small and large, both rich and poor, free the slaves to have on his right hand on his forehead, or cejch to buy or sell, who is not marked on behalf of the beast or number of her name.
It is important to understand: who has the sense to count the number of the beast.
That number indicates the man, and it's the number sixty six šestset. ''
The movie Argo: when is the worst call Hollywood
In November 1979 Islamist demonstrators occupied the crowd of students in the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
We should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Rézu Pahlavi, who fled to the US after the revolution, the patron saint of his regime for several decades.
For an american administration situation offered a positive outcome to the Shah-throw overboard, she could not afford, because it would be so significantly harm confidence among allies in other countries.
The released hostages in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, has not been able to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later compounded the fiasco of an attempt to free the hostages by force.
Arrest diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations brokered by the Algerian Government.
Their ordeal at home even protiíránského Solidarity sparked a wave of sentiment.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the loss of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film actor Ben Affleck režírujícího ARGO describes one episode in the history of America, which brought a small victory.
Just before the embassy cast of six employees have fled.
Following the difficult peripetiích ended up in the home of the canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities had managed to get them from Iran, helped his extravagant cover story-went to the canadian passports as members of the film crew, who was in the country at the location for filming of science fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on `` exfiltraci ''Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
So the legend was credible, the film project in the specialist magazine, held press conferences, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation were long classified, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck film is a particular combination of more genres.
On the one hand, the realism of the political thriller, at the same time, the so-called `` Caper movie '', the story of vydařeného piece-podrazu example may be a series of Danny's teammates.
In the film, so changing moods-on the one hand, the pojaté sequences from Tehran in titulkové sequence are shown ikonické period photographs of events and the manner in which they were the same situations presented in the film-the large differences in it).
On the other hand, the light passages from Hollywood pojednané with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions-the men in suits to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the phone …
Ben Affleckovi is remarkably managed to restart his career.
From vysmívaného actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of cynical comment.
Argo is his third feature film, after dark krimi Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller of the city (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Affleck slide, which take place in režisérově Boston home.
Feeling for the atmosphere of the place he was among the characteristics of the režisérovy older films povyšovaly over Hollywood standard.
Affleck and it also reflected in Argu, where Tehran `` plays Canada. ''
The best scenes in the film is taking place in the streets, while rekonstruování real events-the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its přehlednosti, who also conveys emotion and confusion, the nepřevídatelnosti arise when a sudden move history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes fictitious (false staff on the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with that story told by the offer much in the film the meaning of sensational scenes.
Quite successfully with the little works, sometimes to reality-přimyslí something there so elegantly (based on the scene, in which an imminent crisis at the Tehran airport averts call in America and chase down the runway is a pretty).
The weakness of the Argo's ramblings resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are roles in Hollywood collaborators very šaramantní, their figures would he deserved more space and are not in this movie is far from the only ones.
Affleck film loses a bit of a dramatic move, it's a snapshot, which can be monitored with mild interest, to appreciate the implementation and retro style thrillers evokující 70 years ago.
But pulling hard.
As a reminder of one still in some way living history and how they are exaggerated notions of allpowerful and all-knowing secret services, but will suffice.
The rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The site www.. com, which annually bankovnipoplatky issues poll of nejabsurdnější bank charges, has now decided to contest the `` the most absurd regulation or ideas from the workshop of the EU ''.
`` Led us to this last event, when the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in management of large european companies, ''said the organizer of the survey, Patrick Nacher.
Among the nominated by the absurd is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of the unification of the premium rates for men and women.
Yet while the women were in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are for insurance objectively less risky.
`` The other incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU may nominate people by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013, ''he informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations include even mandatory blending biofuels into fuel, which, as a result of damage to nature, the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, just because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the size of the slepičích cages, which this year, significantly expensive eggs.
The criticism previously faced the prohibition on the use of the term butter or pomazánkové decommissioning light bulbs from the sale.
Quality bananas have 14 inches
The EU apparatus often decided under the pressure of this or that commercial or industrial lobbies, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend any state or group of states (as the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto promotes the requirements of its banks).
The interests of the lobby stood behind it, for example, that the bananas of the highest quality in the Union to achieve at least 14 cm in length and not show `` anomální curvature. ''
The European Commission meanwhile said that only harmonises past nejednotné national standards, which complicated trading.
Standards of fruit and vegetables, the EU over the opposition of some states softened, pointing out that the existing directives to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in the poll may also be the last EU regulation, which must be sold by balloons mandatory warnings that children younger than 8 years may not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU's appeal to the american research, in which the balloons are among the leading cause of death in children's toys to asphyxiation.
Similar restrictions now pay for children up to 14 years in blowing into pouťových frkaček.
Quaint ideas are born at home
Rather it is absurd and then rule on themselves by european officials-anyone who has a formal role in the EU, with regard to the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name of Macedonia and must instead talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server. Com Bankovnípoplatky in cooperation with the association of laissez-faire nominating liberal economists in the survey, except in certain of the above absurd even Union regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which could be located within the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then crossed the example set by the volumes for canned mushrooms, for which he threatened a large fine.
The organisers of the survey also took the idea to pay some of the countries that do not have the sea, and the idea for the granting of subsidies for the subsidy.
These ideas, however, emerged in Brussels, but in Prague.
`` We are handicapováni that we have got the sea.
Ask the European Union for reimbursement, ''he said in the fall of 2004, the minister of agriculture Jaroslav PALAS (PM).
As the argument that for us to breed a lot of grain and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should become full of warehouses, which had to be exported.
The Czech Republic has continued to ports, we should the EU under Palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally came out to meet the Czech Republic, organised a tender to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Grant to obtain the subsidy offered municipalities of the Regional Development Ministry managed by the German Minister Paul (US-DEU), in particular, should go to the application of subsidies from Brussels.
The EU's bizarre regulations are the exception:
The regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of EU regulation and, at the same time, more efficient operation and development of the entire Union under a number of experts deserve recognition.
Problem is, according to experts such as spending of EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of the european integration, but that in the budget negotiations until the Member States.
The emotion between the Czechs raises even that, as well as other countries of the Union to the Czech Republic in Brussels to fight for the right to a specific indication of their traditional products, and not always in this struggle will succeed.
The Czechs, although after a six-year fight with the Germans and Austrians our marking Olomouc curd, but domestic rum, whose tradition for us dates back to the 19 th century, we had our producers to rename tuzemák.
Naming rum can carry only products from the cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
The official list of authorised products in the EU, in the company of the world-famous feta cheese and Gorgonzola, from the German Lübeck marzipan or parmské hams had ended, for example, the Karlovy Vary Pohořelický Třeboňský kapr biscuits, and even the outer package.
The mark of the EU can also boast Pardubický gingerbread and wafers.
People want to save the Republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, you wonder, that he wants to run for president?
It's not about it, to be a senator or president.
If it worked in our country without problems, so not nekandiduji.
Already, but I can not see how the last twenty years rozkrádá country as thieves run here, people are increasing taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, so I try to come up with a solution, and how to change it.
And since I was three and I am an independent nestraník, I do not have any other choice, how things influence than to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, you get, but then you are off to the castle.
Neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
The whole time I was told that the battle for the castle will go under the result in the senatorial election.
I later clarified that, if I am elected senator, I will run for president.
My aim is not function, the function of the instrument is, how can I make their visions.
That's why I need to maximise the impact and the strongest mandate.
But the problem is not just that, as a nation at the pub and on television, but that the trampling everyone who wants to change.
To add the media dehonestují man and that mistake the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
I might not be argued that uplácím journalists or that I was an advisor to George Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
The battle for the castle you started with the idea of the material and the criminal responsibility of politicians and zpětných property returns over twenty million.
The need to change the law.
As president, but you do not have that power, and the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you solve?
When I was a citizen to lobby for it to průvodcovství was free trade, managed to get it through.
The problem is politics-when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, on purpose is rejected, and the citizens of the residence.
As an independent nestraník have much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My preference is that, without the partisan compartmentalisation dogmas and I can take what is best for our country, from each party and apply it.
Think rather man right-wing or left-wing?
From the czech point of view, it seems to me that people rank more to the left.
For me is not important, if a bit to the left, or a little bit to the right.
It's important for me to go ahead.
This is not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right, but I want to bring people together.
Always support any public good solution, though he proposes Communist or ODS, and so I am against a bad idea.
Angry when someone tells you that you are a populist.
But it proves what you said?
When you construct byznysplán in the company, and also have an ideal target and vision.
And he is trying to approach.
Anyone can call populism, but all proposals of which I speak, now in the world of work, or talked about prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament will have just passwords.
And with that long-term nevystačíte in politics.
Or do you think that when you will be for people to walk and talk with them, that you will be able to push through, for example, a criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Persuading politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to your side to it.
If I was elected president, the problem is not a direct transfer of television, where the president will ask parliamentary parties, to enact the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they would eventually have to tell her why they do not want to.
He will be a strong personality, which will name abuses, may push the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was because of public pressure.
Frankly, I say that I am an amateur, that I am not a genius, not an intellectual.
For his views and the vision of trying to find allies.
In politics, I have only just started and for its program to try to gain majority support.
Things are trying to push myself, if it does not work, for six years and will return to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that in one person will not do anything, so I walked around a number of famous people, whether it would also stand as candidates in the Senate.
I followed Radimem Jančurou, because of the amount of work he refused.
So at least I supported investigative journalist Joan Lorencovou that rozkrývala fraud with light and heating oil.
I ran with it, that people are really dissatisfied, but now I am in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people not to vote, and those who went, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we just two independent.
People navolili divisions, so that the changes will be difficult to enforce.
Still, I will fight for your vision, such as the direct election of mayors or generals.
Considering establishing his own party?
I am still thinking about it, because I do not have time to check the net past any potential Party, and did not have the money.
I do not have the money or the presidential campaign, on my transparent account is only 20 thousand.
You do not have the money?
You are talking about majetkových returns, what's yours?
Private property or to about 60 million.
In Prague, I have the land about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another home for eight million, a collection of art about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and damage Superb million and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, I have Aston Martin, because that was my kid's dream-I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was a gallant women and also fought against the wickedness and abuses.
You drive Aston Martin, you have the property for 60 million, and you do not have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money into it too much to give you.
It's not very convincing.
I have 15 million for the campaign.
That should he?
The campaign was already 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that the program is not about such interest.
And I do not have an obligation to pay from his campaign.
The cost of the campaign I basically will cover it, which will receive a senatorial salary.
But he would live in, for example, I could not pay the son of the english school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
I just wanted to make money, then I am not nekandiduji.
So you will continue to be subject to live?
Did you say that these activities utlumíte?
But it's not related to the amount of salary.
As I promised, their activities was partially allayed.
For example, the director of the travel agency in the spring of my representative.
People would like to be the Samaritan, which will save the Republic.
But I also need to live.
How much are you as an entrepreneur was used to take a month?
Two hundred thousand up to 400, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would have my business.
The whole conversation, you will find in the Saturday edition of the law.
The architects MVRDV are proof that real adventures to occur only in his head-Spijkenisse, for example, and recently built a mountain of books-2 pictures
`` This building seems cheerful, looks futuristic. finally is once again to see something interesting, ''says Lisette Verhaig that goes around the edge of the road.
Stefan Spermon, it technician in a large firm, says: `` of course, the house is nice. ''
But I wonder what today we need a library.
They are all Internet iPady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily nobody, or so?
Spijkenisse, in close proximity to the Rotterdam without their own jobs, which is not worth a visit, holding a special record.
This community with 80 000 inhabitants has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To this silly situation resolved, made a few years ago, the decision to contribute to a general education and build seven nice gaudy reinforced concrete thumbnails of fictional bridges, which are the shown on euros.
The success of the educational offensive but he was not dizzy.
And so the city fathers recognized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we have to have a library!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architectural insanely courageous MVRDV, Master sloupcových graphs and vtipných issuer, often even cynical buildings, adopted the thing with the usual calm and the competitive meeting in 2003, he appeared with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the Commission is still stunned, looking around and shrugs, piling cheeky Maas their gifts to the size and his aktivisticky reasoned speech ended the words `` nice urban community! ''
So this is my proposal to the mountain of books in Spijkenisse, so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was for 30 million against.
It is part of a revitalizačního project, which includes also underground parking, supermarket, mail and several adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November was a mountain of books honoured with the second place `` BEST Library of NL 2012 ''.
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award in 2012.
Small-town gray, which still could offer more than postmoderní pedestrian zone and extremely ugly City Hall, whose white facade would rather expected dairy, is due to richer by some contemporary architecture.
In particular, but now Spijkenisse first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
First impression: čtenářské El Dorado under the hatch to cheese.
Although the elevator ride means massif mountains, but the actual space and reading passion turn up at pěším control topography.
All sides of the glass-walled interior is bright and clear, the floor of the páleného kabřince and elegant streetlight clearly reflect the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see parkové benches, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
And everywhere books, books, books.
`` Normally costs shelves of books along the facade and is in the middle of a dark space, which is mostly neútulný and impersonal, ''says Winy Maas.
We are the classic spatial configuration built upside down and the space for the reader we sprouted from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books is cleverly used: Wednesday offices are situated, internet library, the chess club, the Organic Center and operator of the house.
A special pleasure are black shelves of books, which are one lining the walls, once the sill and sometimes the railing of the stairs.
The appearance of the structure, and the smell of an alien nature.
The unknown building material shaking their heads and even avowed architects and engineers.
`` We wanted to work with recycled materials, ''says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the municipality of Spijkenisse, the magazine's standard.
And so we are in one fríském holding one day they encountered a waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the greenhouses and on the fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis for roots milimetrové webs of synthetic material.
It's cheap and effective.
Thin linen, one of the last two seasons, and he's ready to blow up into the huge waste.
The library was fleece-for the first time in such quantities-pressed down on the thickness of the four inches.
Of the heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (Human) where the dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that smells like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps to get to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long journey will be in literary cafe rewarded not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the dutch croquettes and ficus in pots.
You take care of the atmosphere, but mostly on the right the moisture in the air in the literature.
Gifts for the new soul
`` I did not believe it, but this house is despite many glass surfaces drill project in terms of ecology, ''says Trouborst.
Heating and cooling the warmth of the earth.
Although the mountain of books standing under a glass dome, the sun is shining in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
The wide wooden vazníky glued, perpendicular to the glass facade, serve as zastínění and pick up a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, initial skeptic of the it industry, already a new library.
Both Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the traditional chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as the `` long awaited Spijkenisse soul ''.
The reason: each of the people of the city was a few weeks ago invited to open in order to devote a book of his personal fund.
So should first be filled with optical gaps in not yet fully fitted with the library, which currently comprises 70 000 pieces.
The concept has been proven.
The shelves are completely full.
`` There is nothing worse than a half-empty library, ''says Winy Maas architect.
`` I think that, thanks to our house now has a new home every inhabitant of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just for show.
That MVRDV succes in Royal discipline, which is in a technical jargon says the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse decided the history of literature.
No matter how young and uneducated.
It's finally starting point for identity.
Szabo: `` the Germans must play a greater role, ''
Germany abstained in deciding on the acceptance of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe, Stephen Szaboa that Berlin teetering on the edge of a narrow diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany earlier this week, the first signal that voted against the proposal for the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, must be Germany because of its special relationship with Israel prudent.
But at the same time I think I will not support the american position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence-without, however, would be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also delayed the vote, when it came to the establishment of a no-fly zone.
We ultimately put NATO.
It is difficult for Germany, for serious international issues a clear position?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that, just as his foreign policy, from the direction of the policy, which was so controlled by the US, in the direction of the german foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult, that the Europeans have a coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are between two lanes.
They are expected to play the independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think, in his role as only stay, but they are on their way to the `` normálnější ''foreign policy.
In foreign policy, in France or Britain.
What exactly does the `` normal ''foreign policy from a german point of view?
Shows preparedness to take in the event of national interests and positions, which are independent of the attitudes of the US or european partners.
I think that the german foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, the Export and his relationships with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of the other major powers, and therefore, Germany has to protect its interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the attitude of the Middle East conflict and vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, especially in states around the Persian Gulf.
It must, therefore, be careful to discourage the public, but even the elite in arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
I would not want it but not ascribe too much of it, it's not entirely one-sided relationship.
In any case, that plays an important role in the german considerations.
Damage relations with Germany, the US, Germany, in the case of two important decision delayed the vote, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think that, in Europe and even the US rules the great sympathy for the german position.
Therefore, I do not think that it was so dramatic breakthrough as the issue of Libya.
Perhaps from Germany even harvests some respect.
It signals that must be considered as an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.
There are between the US and many european nations differences?
These disparities exist in America's internal policies.
I think that the Obama administration has probably secretly considerable sympathy for the european position.
But as a result of the political situation in this position, of course, serve the public.
I think that the differences in opinions really are not so large, as they always do.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not too thrilled Netanjahuovou policy.
It is not for Germany to align their close relations with Israel and the US on one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that this is exactly what the Germans difficult.
For the Germans would, of course, was a little easier, if there was a coherent and united european policy, which is currently not.
They can not, therefore, be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from his own position.
That is just what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the european position.
It's not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
It has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player wants to take a major role at all??
Or is the lead role for Germany still difficult?
Germany it is still used, it's still uncomfortable, and for this country, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the european crisis, as always, when Germany take a greater role, incurred protiněmecké moods.
It's easy for the Germans.
It's an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a more vulnerable position than the US.
It must be acceptable for a variety of neighbors and opinions, and it's not easy.
US influence in european politics now constantly falling, but the EU this vacuum currently blank. who's otherwise left?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it, they feel uncomfortable and make them that much neoblíbenějšími-c'est la vie.

14 September 2010 he left one chinese company to protect the brand Puma Zegna DF. made a name which, even at the fashion house of parazituje Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are the world champions in copying and violations of intellectual property.
In major cities are několikapatrové malls, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
But other cases are Pattlochovy. the authority of their principals goes against chinese firms have received from známkového all officially the right to use the designation, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it `` Bang Mingpai '', the onset of the tag.
This word focuses on `` Bang Dakuan ''.
This meant women who hunt rich men.
The chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
`` It damages the trade, we have to fight, ''calls on Pattloch.
`` The mark is diluted, the monopoly disappears, the damage to the image is great. ''
The financial losses and court costs of affected industries are in the millions, mainly for the precious sample products.
According to the company's data for market research is the CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the market, which is growing fast.
The deletion of dubious records in the record labels can be difficult to achieve, however, and it's worth something.
The procedure can last up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells of cases where the court has rejected the claims, because vytýkaný name became, after a long period of `` market reality. ''
If the plaintiff has the misfortune to plagiátorovi still pay because damaged his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
Known cases involving the graphic elements.
In 2009, the Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction machinery, Sany undertaking, who recently took over the german manufacturer pumps on the cement mixture of Putzmeister.
The Chinese may therefore still use the emblem, which resembles the star of the Mercedes.
The company, which bought Volvo, originally used the blue-white logo, which resembled a BMW. dispute was settled, the Geely logo had to change.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China with the forgers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had known the crocodile turned in the opposite direction.
The chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
Office známkový CTMO recognizes that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of too much of a small number of staff and premises.
But in the last year, said `` the work of the emergency situation back to normal. ''
For example, the number of raw proceedings on objections fell by 22 percent.
These cases were closed, 57,000, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still waiting on the office still 81 500 complaints.
To do something about it's expensive
As in China, they are often impressive number.
Last year was CTMO served more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of the brand, which is almost a third more than in 2010.
It's a record, and it means that China for the tenth time behind a list of new applications throughout the world.
This is also true for the number of all applicable safeguard brands-is a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the fees collected 1.8 billion yuan.
It simply means that every login at an average cost of 1280 renminbi, or 160 euros.
Start against the dispute is několikanásobek, as shown in the case of the german family business Freudenberg.
This group has more than seven years of fighting against the chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans had achieved that was cancelled his illegal imitovaných production of car parts.
But the forger making chinese rights to the brand continues to Freudenberg.
Alone we have failed, as in Germany can not be protected by the surname, says Hannah Wentzler, chairman of the management of the company, Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
Office známkový CTMO then also object to the Munich company rejected.
In two other instances of the Freudenberg got right, but the defendant in the dispute fights on this day.
It should be just as careful
Now the matter is pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the case could lead to a good end, and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But it also says: `` the procedure is extremely expensive and cost us a lot of time, money, and the nerves. ''
Internal costs can not be quantified in the archives of the company had to even see a hundred years old, to produce the evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg opposing vainly offered a `` high six-figure sum in euro ''for the purpose of the settlement of the dispute.
`` So you see, what it means to us, ''says Wentzler.
Risk that the danger from the Far East hits, and Europe.
And that, in the case of his imitators to ensure the unprotected brands.
One chinese producer, for example, wanted to log in Germany marking Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of the business, the group had given up, he could turn the registration.
`` It should be just as careful, ''says Wentzler.
He also advises the german firms Pattloch lawyer to trade with China is very careful.
Not enough to rely on international známková rights. foreigners would rather have `` everything in any way for protection, known in China, ''says Wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the Freudenberg in the last act of his drama with the brand, then I will have to be the party to pay royalties for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or will we be in a contested segment pushed out of the market.
World Aids Day: stamping, singing, help
In Heidelberg College Imbongi tested-and in Swaziland it pleased orphans after the parents, who died of AIDS.
The story of the merger, which surpasses much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's shoes and men's moccasins looking on the dance floor tact and it quickly.
Jeden-tac-three-four.
Then slowly swell the voices of the singers-Alt, Bass, tenor and soprano, urging, cajoling and mutual respect.
29-year-old conductor almost Fiete Hopfa lifting his textile shoes, combining their voices yielded wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the Music Hall Institute. medical psychology in Heidelberg College Imbongi tested a new song.
At fifty singers and opera between 23 and 69 years, scientists from the human genetics after a janitor.
`` Om'Obani ''is not an easy track, each choral voice has a different text and yet in a foreign language-Zulu, which speaks of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in parts.
Aid to svépomoci
The programme, the United Nations for the fight against AIDS, estimates that the world lives around 34 million people who are infected with HIV.
From 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland is 245 000 orphans after the parents, who died of AIDS.
Hiv-positive is already more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after the parents, who died of AIDS, in the village of Esitjeni found a bunch of voices for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend school in the second degree.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take the patronage.
It guarantees a child's tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo-Center.
In the language of the Zulu Imbongi means `` storyteller ''or `` whoever praises.''
Fluent bantuštinou can not in this space, no one to talk, just sing.
Nearly ten years of practicing the chorus of the song in this strange soft speech, and sometimes they also brings back there, originally from: south african.
In the air at 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in the north-east of the Kingdom of Swaziland Esitjeni village, which is dependent on the faculty of the votes of the german judiciary.
Forty percent of the infected
There are about 2,000 people, some of them in simple mud huts or slaměných. a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them already have parents, because they had succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni is seen in a small, well the whole of Swaziland: the highest rate of infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half the population will not accept.
More than 40 percent of the people in Swaziland carries the virus weakened immunity .'not uncommon that die in less than 30 years.
This village a choir in joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005, above, however, members of the Imbongi saw many of the children on the streets, which not only lacked parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a complete education in a poor country, had no chance.
Initially, it was still the deployment of private individuals, which, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
But a year later, was based on the chorus - `` voices for Africa '', since it takes care of orphans after the parents, who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
The nejzávažnější sexually transmissible diseases?
The bakteriálním sleep to syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (GONORRHOEA).
Frequent viral sleep HIV, the human papillomaviruses, herpes glandis or hepatitis.
Crabs and scabies belongs to parazitárním sleep.
Who belongs to the group most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea can be found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four of the five of all cases of syphilis, which have been reported in Germany, are transmitted through sexual contact between the men.
For straight adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové, infections trichomonády, candidiasis (mold), gonorrhea and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults in our extended relatively little, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV for this group.
Between the juveniles are chlamydiové infections occur significantly more often than other groups of the population.
According to the survey, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In addition, between the juveniles often human papillomaviruses.
How developed the number of infections?
Not all of the sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
The number of infected syfilidou according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV since 2007.
The year 2011 was approximately 700 cases.
That's roughly one tenth of less than a year before.
What are the symptoms of attention of venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and pustules or warts.
Often, however, cause no pain or other symptoms, and will remain so nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
The risk of the disease may reduce the condoms, however, offer 100 percent protection.
As the originators of sexually transmitted diseases may be partially to the infection of impurities and narrow physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, in particular, in the case of the frequent rotation of sexual partners, routine examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure the most sleep and prevent future consequences.
Thanks to the patronátu charitable donations, and finally honorářům, which earns choir singing throughout Germany, to collect the money.
`` We are already into Esitjeni sent roughly 200 000 euros, ''says the President of the Society of Annette Lennartz.
The money from Germany manages itself in the village of Dlamini Zodwa, self-confident, the woman who can impose.
Under-age also about orphaned children found, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, in the language of Zululand, says the old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have even 14 orphans, giving them a roof over your head, and they are concerned about the children to attend every day in time in uniform to school.
Children who already have one, go to a shelter to Khanyisile, lonely woman paid by society as well as two cooks, daily cooking for more than 200 hungry children.
`` Voices for Africa '', founded the school sewing, two henhouses and together with the American Health Organization dogs arranged that many people in the village had to do the test for HIV.
It is commonplace. even if it is the disease throughout the country so obvious, all of it is silent.
The king with 14 wives
`` AIDS is absolutely taboo, ''says Annette Lennartz, `` because it has something to do with sexuality.''
In fact, some odd in a country where the king officially maintains 14 wives.
The last black Africa an absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for its nemírným lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
The state approved by way of life by, among other things, that the blame for the HIV virus in recent decades so quickly spread.
But many migrant workers, who have the virus spread the word around the country.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are not on every corner, `` but no one uses them.
The culture is different-unprotected intercourse. ''
To support at least a little bit of cultural exchange, travels Imbongi choir once for two, three years together after South Africa and singing songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the confidence of blacks, many in the southern tip of the dark continent known in the days of apartheid.
The bus was full of white people who sing songs in the language of blacks-so not only brings the mood and joy, but also elicit tears at many of the wild frontier soldiers.
The road always leads to Esitjeni, where singers visit children, which have a sponsor.
Although this village could hardly find maps in the valley of the River Ezulweni is more than familiar.
`` Go to Esitjeni, there is light, ''says the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is miles away as the crow flies 8733, the dupajícím singers in rehearsal on Bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here.
NASA's Mercury Messenger appeared on the ice:
Messenger probe found evidence that the planet Mercury ice.
The thickness of the ice could have up to 20 feet.
The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Even when the closest to the sun, there's also the frozen water from the three studies, which on Thursday published a professional magazine `` Science ''.
Messenger probe found evidence for that, in the area of this planet, which lies in the shadow of the durable, there is ice.
It is alleged that at least 30 inches and maybe even up to 20 feet thick.
The water came in from the comet or perhaps from the asteroid that crashed into the Mercury.
None but the finding of the ice is associated with the existence of life on this planet, said the head of the scientists working on the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can be up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we could help explain how the water and other essential elements of life into other areas of the solar system.

Our insights into space telescopes, the most significant:
The glasses reportedly invented the year 1608 Hans Lipperhey. before Galileo Galilei it a year later used to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes grew-and look to broker, are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was a period of 30 years, from 1947 until 1975, Haleův telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror on this figure had an average of five yards.
In the US, Arizona's Large Binocular Telescope.
On insight into space by two mirrors, each of which has an average of 8.4 yards.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands-La Palma is huge. only a mirror the diameter of 10.4 meters.
A mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa's segmentované to cost savings.
Yet his average roughly eleven yards.
The disadvantage of low-priced way: the construction of the telescope's secured hákovadlem in height to angle, which is limited in his mobility.
In height to angle is fixed and the Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas.
His feature is the high gain of flux.
This is despite the relatively small diameter mirror-the largest zrcadlovým dalekohledům world.

It's Very Large Telescope-and doing his name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can shine a light through the medium of infrared spectrum.
The Very Large Telescope is planned on the chilean Observatory ace.
Its main mirror has to have the full 42 meters and is composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
But with the images can be expected soon in 2018.
Two Keckovy telescopes on the hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea in 2007, considered the largest in the world.

Scientists on the basis that there is ice on the south pole of Mercury.
For that, however, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger orbiting the planet far closer to the North Pole.
The radar measurements showed several tens of years, that is the ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists have now.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people lived to the age of the Bible.

The search for clues in the country, where are the 97-old people still relatively young.
Driving range can call Talyš wildly romantic.
The van rumble down the road with many curves along the densely forested hills, predatory rivers and simple selských buildings.
It's all green and lush, almost, it seems that we are in Schwarzwaldu.
But this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan. border with Iran is only a few miles away.
Here are the caucasian Talyšů ethnic group, which is not too well known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and ázerbájdžánsky and living a very old age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture of soviet times, which is a picturesque mountain landscape, somehow.
Tourists from Europe here goes. arrival from Baku in Azerbaijan is too difficult.
The 323 miles is required for eight hours, because the road is only jednoproudová.
Riches, for which the country owes oil in the Caspian Sea, here in the country not yet arrived.
Pilata Fatulajeva (48), however, is convinced that Lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
`` Baku in May for a great price for the Eurovision Song Contest-and we here next year we will have the festival, the oldest man in the world, ''says Fatulajeva.
The director of the Museum of longevity, about one in the world.
Here's the documented life almost eight Talyšů dozens of them who are older hundred years. Fatulajeva shows a black-and-white photo.
That's my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In the age of 136 years to father a child.
A contentious star of this museum is, however, a shepherd sheep, which allegedly Şirali Müslümov was 168 years.
The birth certificate, however, does not exist.
And, given that the oldest man with the documents was 122 years, it seems Müslümovův age extremely dubious.
`` He was born in this area in 1805 and 1973 died, ''explains Fatulajeva.
This man was allegedly married three times and had children at the age of 23. 136 more fathered a daughter.
About the Şirali Müslümov in a few decades?
About letitých people in Central Asia, however, heard the Rembrandt gerontolog Scholz, Max Planck Institute in Rostock.
`` Too many people in old age in some areas of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, ''says Scholz, `` also in Sardinia lives extremely many very old men.''
Because of the lack of background, however, can not be made no scientific proof of age, especially if the lack of vital records.
Every day the glass melted butter
But the fact is that people in the area around Leriku live biblical age too often.
Currently, there are 20 people, which are more than 100 years old.
So why are so many people here in the south of the aged?
Azerbaijani Wizard Farid Mugimzadeh explains specific genes Talyšů.
Director Fatuljeva museum instead, it lies in the diet.
But the fact that it was the calorie diet, who love Talyšů meat, bread, and, above all, dairy products and many of whom daily drink a glass of the melted butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického terms seem very plausible.
Or is it the old way of life, which maintains the young people in the tiny village of Cengemiranu?, near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzajeva.
In 97 years at this latitude is still relatively young.
Mirzajeva, which argues that it has 143 offspring, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor with máselnicí, tirelessly kolíbá.
Under one roof, there are eight people, including one of the sons of Mirzajevy and daughter both are long grandparents.
Jumping around and two small children.
In the kitchen, preparing for guests of the tea, which is administered in typical břichatých glasses `` armadu ''.
White teeth Mirzajevy form a perfect number and the scarf hiding a long dark blond braids, before us proudly revealing her son.
Always I was washing my hair, milk, so I looked and maintain a color.
`` I have never used the shampoo, ''says Mirzajeva.
A monthly income to sustain life
She ate only what it came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For my whole life, I have never bought food in the supermarket.
He tells about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst of it was in the Second World War.
But everything is improved when the oar took the `` beloved father Heydar Aliyev. ''
Propaganda sounds from the mouth of the old woman's weird.
But the cult, which makes around the father figure of nations, who ruled the country like a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no bounds.
Was in power until 2003, then took his son Ilham oar.
Old people in Azerbaijan at least suffer privation.
Mirzajeva receives each month Income 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euro). this is here, from which to live well.
And maybe it has also long zešedivělý Mirzajevy son: `` the old people enjoy in our culture, the great dignity. ''
They live in the middle of the large families, they are loved opečováváni, and they are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The concept of `` human rights ''in the Constitution is missing
Cairo returned the revolution.
Contending demonstrations in Cairo revealed deep divisions in the country.
The discussion on the future constitution based on Sharia law.
The egyptian president spared pathos.
We need to create a transition.
`` And for that we can manage it, I am responsible for me, and the people of God, ''he said on state television.
His speech was intended to the entire nation, but mainly christian copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
They are all still hopelessly squabbling in opposition, because they are afraid.
The fear of the `` State ''on the Nile issued at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Mursí almost apologetically told that temporarily limit the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his own, to `` save the revolution ''.
What, however, wants a 61-year-old engineer, who has a PhD at American University in southern California, really save, the Egyptians are not clear about the world.
Justice should be stripped of power?
234 sections, which stohlavé Constituent Assembly dominated by islamists hastily approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partially raise concern.
As in previous constitutions, says in the proposal that the jurisdiction is based on the `` principles of islamic law ''.
But what does `` principles ''?
It was and is a matter of interpretation and may be worried that islamists this vague wording and their associated legal free space used for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least it illuminates the newly added section: in all matters relating to the Sharia should deal with the University of al-Azhar, which is the most important islamic institution in the country with a big influence on the whole Sunni Islam.
Not necessarily, but this may mean that the clerisy will exercise oversight of the legislation, which would bring to justice the de facto withdrawal -.
In the draft constitution much is a matter of interpretation
The problem is also that continue to be maintained in the civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship in military custody until 11 000 civilians.
Standing in the proposal, the State should also protect `` the true nature of the egyptian family and support her morals and values. ''
It is legally worded so inaccurately, that means this section of the institutions of the state could even control the content of the film and literature.
In plain language, it is nothing more than censorship.
After all, no section in writing the explicit equality of men and women.
But another section prohibits vilify or denigrate the Prophet Mohammed and his agent.
However, what remains unclear is the defamation of and how it will be prosecuted.
As dubious acts formulation that is forbidden to `` insulting people. ''
In this case, the caricature of a president or a joke at the expense of experts, right?
A matter of interpretation, like much else in this proposal, which the Mursí present to sign, and his words will be `` very soon ''to present the Egyptians for the purpose of the popular vote.
`` The revolution is back, ''
For several weeks, the formation of the opposition against the odds of islamists.
Tens of thousands of people have gathered in an unusual unity on Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and pledged to destroy the constitutional document before it starts.
`` The revolution is back and we will win, ''said Hamdín Sabbáhí, which in the presidential election was in third place.
A Nobel Prizes and former director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution include `` to the dustbin of history. ''
Service through the short messages on Twitter followers accused Mursího that want to make `` coup against democracy. ''
`` If a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him, ''said Yasser Said, a member of the opposition.
`` We are not tired, the blood of our brothers have yet to be sanctioned, ''the egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Several judges announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would become invalid.
`` The Koran is our constitution ''
Well organized Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, out of caution, however, not in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before káhirskou University.
There were many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis, who called: `` people are demanding the application of God's law. ''
Called Mursího: `` clean country! ''and assured: `` the Koran is our constitution.''
The fight over sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrír square on which all began, would trigger a state similar to civil war.
It Mursího supporters apparently did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents and supporters of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide which direction the country should go.
For some it is regarded as the majority in favour of the proposal by islamists.
`` The word'human rights' present even once, ''
The forced constitutional dispute, which should continue until February and integrate all social forces ročiluje Hafez Abu Sa'du.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (the EOHR) defended the members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before the court.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because it that human rights are indivisible.
It was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
`` And in the new constitution now are not the words' human rights' not once, ''she says in an interview for `` Welt am Sonntag''.
Mursího extension of power to all three power components in the State made this lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt toward a new dictatorship.
`` Instead, the president to strengthen civil society, in fact it annulled, ''complains Sa'Da.
But without civil society organisations democracy can not work.
Sa'Da feel abandoned, and the international community, which monitors the game of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That he could backfire.

The Norwegian rakfisk: the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Five million people living in Norway enjoys one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but also in the world.
It might be the secret of success of the country associated with the local voracious appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put it down in the middle of the pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave this week.
So can smell the paralysis of the smell of rakfisku, one of the largest norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's the snow, a beautiful view-and the ubiquitous smell in the air.
Salted trout Rakfisk is fermented in the water for up to a year-it depends on how much you want to fish smell.
As dusk and begins to be cold, the Norwegians here in Fagernes meet the festival devoted to this, as you say, the best nejpodmanivějšímu food.
`` You eat it raw and then zapijete aquavitu drink, ''says Havard Halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called `` Rakfisk general '', which is responsible for the course of the festival.
All around us, people eat small cubes and fish and with them a large quantity of alcohol.
`` Some people are better than rakfisk aquavit, ''says Havard.
The drink may trump the smell.
A few bits and pieces I will try.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad-it's like a piece of sushi, who was on a long journey by bus.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time in Norway, poverty, and yet because there was no refrigerator, fish in the fall, soaking into airtight barrels of water and salt.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermenting, dragged and eating-senses are undoubtedly blunt alcohol.
Only a generation ago, there were thousands of Norwegians forced to leave the country in search of work, mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly-more than 13% of immigrants attracted by a large amount of work, high and extensive care system.
In Sweden, the old rival, which was recently much richer than Norway, flowing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, indispensable, even though relatively stinking part of Norway in the past.
Among the more expensive meals on the market.
Even if everything is expensive-a small glass of beer or a sandwich you comes to 9 pounds (14 dollars) apiece.
Norway is the global reports often-and it seems that most people like it that way.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, the people here still cite with distaste.
Instead, the shooting was called `` the event from 22 July. ''
The Norwegians may find it hard to believe that, in their peaceful country, one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
The current wealth of Norway lies the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries of the early 70 years of the twentieth century.
`` But the oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well, ''says the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress Anna, who with his long blond hair and blue eyes, surprisingly, a prototype of the Nordic welfare.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like most english people here, it is absolutely fine.
Grandstand, we do not like the pomp.
Norway disposes of its oil wealth very carefully-except for a small percentage of most of the money from the industry invested into a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial meltdown threw money, which had the Norwegians had on its purse strings firmly utažené.
`` Until we can ski in winter and summer hiking, we are happy, ''says Anna.
`` And eat rakfisk, ''he adds with a laugh.
I am standing in the snow in the queue for food-rakfisku have had enough.
A moose burger is certainly something else, and it's a juicy.
But the evening's stinking fish here again.
The hotel, in which I live, is one of the many places where made rakfisk dinner where guests choose the best-or, rather, for the most demanding of smell fish.
They have connected with live television coverage, which is the moderator with a bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfiskem.
It's like a singing contest at Eurovision.
`` What the score is for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergene? ''
`` Here's our scorecard, Håvard. ''
There was applause and laughter.
From his chair to fall man, perhaps overwhelmed aquavitem.
Or maybe the fumes from all of those fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico has a hard start
As incoming Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office at Will Grant from the BBC to the challenges faced by, and mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
Transport in Mexico City is currently in a particularly poor.
In the city, which is stuffed up even in the best of times, have been erected steel barriers of closing a few key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim was to prevent dojíždějícím in order to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto received the presidential sash and take over the leadership of the nation.
Facing a challenging task.
Mexico was at the time a hotshot odstupujícího Felipe Calderona well economically, however, the country is in the grip of a drug war, which has already estimated the victim of 60,000 lives for six years.
`` My government has against the people of Mexico's major commitment in the reduction in violence, ''the president said Pena Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of the week.
Design a new security strategy, which will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before he shook hands with the american president, won the president Pena Nieta political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Views on a new leader are different in his old home, and a populous state surrounding the capital city.
Direct man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo to remember him in a good way.
Citizens credited to the development of tourism in the resort and build infrastructure.
The city can now go after one of the new motorways, Pena Nieto to build these motorways are a vast improvement over děravým and knobbed roads that were previously.
The plate with his name also hangs on the wall of the modern sports centre and impressive interactive museum with the issue of climate change.
`` We expect that it will bring real and lasting change, ''says a friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, MEP for the party of President Pena Nieta, the institutionalised Revolution (PRI).
In particular, we hope the interesting and real change in the area of security and the economy that our country needs so badly.
After a steady 81 years in power, the PRI party was pushed out of Vicente Fox.
MP Olvera, admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos inside the party from for Enrique Pena Nieta many expected.
And rejects the statement of opposition characterising the new president as a man without content.
It's a very straightforward man, very busy with the excellent vision of the country.
It's a great statesman and is a man who knows how to listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression, a former governor of many people.
In Nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad but can not be the contrast with the cobbled streets of the Valle del Bravo apparent.
Back under the dálničními nadjezdy in many ways, recalls the outskirts of the Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also persistent and urban.
At the beginning of this year was summoned the army to help with the management of drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, particularly poignant is violence against women.
Only in the last two years, were on the wild places beside the huge waste dump bodies strewn with dozens of murdered women.
At a time when Pena Nieto was governor, was murdered in the State of Mexico, more than 1,000 women, which is much more than the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez-a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, Pena Nieta critics say that when operating in office failed to adequately addressing the problem of the murders of women.
And, in the worst case scenario, his leadership accused of escapism.
In the concrete house, typically for a run-down neighborhood, I Irinea Buendia shows photos of his dead daughter Mariana Luna and stifling tears.
According to the official version of Marian committed suicide in 2010.
Her family, however, believes that she was murdered by her partner.
`` When I arrived at her house, so it seemed as if her body washed, ''recalls Mrs Buendia.
There were signs of strokes and had already begun rigor mortis.
It tells the story of how her mother, Marian, looking down from a picture on the wall, next to the cross, which is the only word: `` justice ''.
However, this is, as they say in the family, that's what they have been denied.
State authorities they treat me as if I was an old Grundy, a troublemaker and kňouralka.
They want to simply accept what they say, and silent.
`` But this can not be right, as so many errors and omissions, ''he says.
Sherpa, which President Pena Nieto on Saturday to receive, is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico, hit by a violent crime, and the new president promised that the period of his tenure in office will be his priority.
`` I hope that the president will be the same as governor, ''he says in the Valle del Bravo Member of the PRI Olvera.
That, however, is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad but fears most.
Bradley Manning complained about poor treatment, says the military prosecutor
The military prosecutor seeks to rebut the allegations of Bradley Manning, the rough treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's residence in military custody in the city in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case was rejected on the basis of the rough treatment with Manningem in prison.
Private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, has missed a lot of opportunities to complain about the rough treatment, which allegedly suffered in military custody.
The military prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein during cross-examination of Private Manning, a preliminary hearing at Ft. Maede in Maryland, argued that the records of weekly visits, Manning had with the officers in the unit during the nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, which occurred during the hearing, carried out at the request of the defence dismiss the case against Manning because of the rough treatment in detention period, which is itself a sufficient punishment, through the day after Manning testified that in custody thought about suicide.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
Wikileaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
At Friday's hearing through the military prosecutor with Fein Manningem form that officers fill out after meeting with Manningem detention at Quantico, where he was from July 2010 to April 2011, held in the scheme with the security.
Officers Manningovi questions and record his response.
When he was Fein on Friday to these forms, he asked Manning admitted that the treatment of his guards assessed as `` excellent ''and the overall treatment facility in assessed as `` very professional''.
The forms show no complaints about the poor treatment, although the officers manning directly to ask how it is handled, Fein said.
Manning said that concerns about the various problems expressed orally and that the officers who visited with him on these concerns and talked and indicated that they will deal with the problems, however.
`` Wrote ''(` `no problems after the debate concerns), and it does not necessarily mean that I am about them,'' said Manning.
Judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning also, she asked why the handling of his complaint in January 2011 at the meeting with the Commission posuzující suicidal thoughts, which a few months previously expressed in the form.
Manning said that in the course of this meeting was his intention to achieve the reduction scheme `` prevention of injury ''.
The army said that in this restrictive regime (one degree under the supervision of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
`` I wanted to make the peacekeepers in custody knew that I was okay and that I wanted to abolish the scheme for the prevention of injuries … to enjoy enhanced quality of life, the way I saw it, ''said Manning.
Manning Thursday testified about his arrest in Iraq and moved to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before he was transported to the detention center at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he considered suicide in Kuwait, and once there because of the heat.
That said, that he was not allowed to know what's going to happen and what is going on in the outside world, it was very depressing.
`` My world shrank only to the base, the Arifdžán cage, ''Manning said on Thursday.
I thought that, in that cage die.
Manning said that after his arrival at Quantico spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company.
Manning said that he was only allowed one mattresses, blankets, slippers, some clothes and sunglasses.
He said that he tried to walk, because sleeping or just the camp was in the course of the day against regulations.
Manning said that he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in the eyes.
It stated that if the guards could see his face when he turned in the middle of the night, on the other hand, woke him and he had to turn back.
Manningův counsel lodged a formal complaint to the treatment of Private Manningem in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also asked the allegations made in a Thursday statement on that, after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell at Quantico, naked, was also forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates at the morning count.
Manning, testified that in him was not allowed to conceal his blanket.
At the hearing Friday by Judge Manning, said that the order of his guards, he decided he had a blanket, which he could hide, delay, but admitted that his order to its postponement.
On Thursday, Manning said he was last night forced to sleep naked, because the officer tried to show that he is not dangerous.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the belt of her underwear or their slippers to hurt himself, but he did not.
Manning, testified that the night was removed from his cell in his underwear, his slippers and glasses.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account of his experience during his captivity, and that in the event of a conviction in a military court, which is expected to start at the beginning of next year, significantly reduced his sentence.
The defense argued that the plans that Manning to admit guilt in lesser offences and that it will fight against other accusations, because they are too extreme.
The start of the hearing is scheduled for this week, it is expected that the military prosecutor will defend couplers conditions as legitimate.
The Pentagon statement said that Manning was held in accordance with rules on all arrested held in custody, with a maximum security.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy against the law, causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My mexicko american identity crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico due to a lack of options that are in there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them hard times, he says.
Navarrette says that mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On the last trip to Mexico City I was barely through the crowd and I came into the space for the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.
Arrows pointed to one of the two fronts: one for `` Mexicanos ''(` `Mexicans '') and the other for` `Extranjeros'' (`` foreigners '').
I stood there for a few seconds, and I did not know where to go.
I grew up in Central California and all my life, I was called `` mexican ''.
It's an ethnic shortcut, the same as my friends in Boston called `` irish ''and my friends in New York call themselves `` Italy''.
So I ended up in the designation `` Mexican American. ''
But this was in Mexico.
And in the homeland of my grandfather was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I have a vocabulary of native speakers, and I can not get rid of the american accent.
So I pulled out my american passport and stood in line for `` Extranjeros ''.
I thought about the moment this week, the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House of President Obama.
The programme had the usual issues which are discussed when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why it's the same likelihood that Mexicans remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
He wants to join with the United States and Canada and create in North America trading bloc, similar to the European Union.
A Pena Nieto has promised that he will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he did not provide any details.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States, complicated and full of unpleasant sensations.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of the mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the range of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So a minute after the representative of the United States to say anything critical about Mexico, you will hear of Mexico in the press and among the elite of the complaint against the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbor.
And the children Montezumy step on the warpath.
And yet for Mexico is that the real challenge of the relationship to more than 35 million mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about the hostile feelings?
That's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people, the country offers possibilities, and others, no.
The only reason why so many people with the Mexican roots lives in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that in one point of our family tree was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And more often than not, it seemed to fit the profile of this person-dark skin, weak education, the origin of the poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not against Mexico.
And even though we are living the american dream, we go to good schools, and we have got a good job, we can never forget the fact that we live the american dream, not in Mexico.
Our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is against the United States.
And beyond that, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us dislike.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as an inferior race, which is not sufficiently mexican.
Our spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is in their view, only about failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, so it would never leave.
And we are now found trapped behind the silken curtain, with the good life in the United States, but even with the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara in childhood legally arrived in the United States, reminds me that among Mexicans and mexican Americans, there is tension, because it means more Mexicans, who they are, and the mexican Americans resent it.
Even if he is a citizen of the United States, sees itself as part of the two countries.
And, at the same time, many mexican Americans, you know, feel like a part of one.
We love listening to the mexican groups, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the Bruce Springsteen.
To get the best of both countries, but you do not have roots in one.
In Mexico on us as Americans.
And in the United States, we have considered the Mexicans.
And that relationship even more complicated, they want some mexican leaders and part of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, together again with the Diaspora.
They want to mexican Americans working for Mexico as `` the ambassadors ''and represented the mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our american citizens, how cool is this country to visit, and push for political leaders to solidify relations with Mexico.
Well.
It was going to happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to the income inequalities and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us is not certain, that it's a great country.
I have a feeling that it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States will act with Mexico in front of one and a half century, so must accept the fact that some mexican Americans still feel uncomfortable for the way in which he was treated with their family in the near past.
Hmm.
Maybe we are more `` Mexicans ''than I thought.
The old battle, the new Middle East
Closure of fire between Israel and Hamas could yet be a basis for peace.
Can ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed suggests that any such problem is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary speculation about who started it, many of the buildings was amended in ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and for the first time rockets from the Gaza Strip landed near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolitan areas, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even if it seems that Israelis and Palestinians stranded in its ancient conflict around the Middle East.
The Arab Spring changed the old order and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, they are caught up in the ensuing chaos in the region.
Maybe it will cause that their fight will be even bloodier than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that it may suspend their deadly stalemate.
The war is not won or lost.
At first glance, it seems, is currently the many reasons to optimizmu.
Even if the cease-fire closed 21 November last fight this week to strengthen the hawks on both sides.
The leader of Hamas, the islamic movement, which rules the Gaza Strip since 2007, will argue that the Israelis forced to retreat, though Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several leaders of Hamas and the conclusion of the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most populous corners of the planet and nejžalostnějších, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
And indeed, Hamas acquires the influence of the West Bank, another piece of Palestine, which is currently controlled by his ardent rivals from the Fatah umírněnější palestinian faction.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas may very well decide that the time is on their side.
Islamists across the arab world have more influence, so Hamas won a powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a regional power, which was once an ally of Israel's closest Muslim, joined the party Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The jubilant people from Hamas say that islamic crescent circle around the north of Israel, Lebanon, where the party rules / militia Hezbollah, Syria, where the rebels, who are increasingly inclined to unseat Bashar Assad islamizmu may, to Jordan, where Hamas' s allies threaten the king.
And, above all, on the southern flank Israel changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, under the leadership of President Mohammad Mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and core arab countries, the balance in the region.
The secular despot, Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no time for Hamas.
Instead, the Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In the future the diplomacy may occur Hamas as a player who can not be excluded either Israel or America.
Conversely, israeli hardliners reach opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back into the box.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system to prove his worth and many Hamas rockets were destroyed.
The Israelis can sleep better-for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as solid as ever, many european countries also blaming Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence.
And the mainly-Israel prospered, in particular, under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was in Israel fairly quiet from suicide bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which interferes with the western shore, the main part of what might be a palestinian state, and protects the jewish settlements, which are still growing despite his unlawful before the international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the beginning of the campaign in the elections of January 22, together with the even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why spoil those treacherous Palestinians, giving them their own state?
If you really ruled on the West Bank, the neodpalovali rockets, like their compatriots in Gaza?
It would be better if we hold them behind that wall and hit them when they stick their heads.
Maybe the hardliners win, but the arab spring may change their calculations.
Even if the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt, Israel and other countries do not have too much in love, their main priority will be to deal with domestic problems.
The israeli defence spending is higher than all of his four arab neighbours together.
The launch of a new war with the local superpower hardly helps the new arab governments to heal its economy.
That President Mursí cooperated with President Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of something new.
Also, the Israelis would be the situation should look in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the arab world is becoming more democratic, creates a denial of rights of Palestinians to self-determination of the barrel with gunpowder, who must one day in areas occupied by Israel to explode-as well as the bus that exploded last week in Tel Aviv.
Currently the repression of weakening in the jewish state of democracy and the demographics of this situation even worse, as the arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza the every few years for the purpose of retraction of Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both parties need incentives from the outside.
The answer is that what they preached sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and these newspapers: two states, Israel referred to the territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is some hope that the cease-fire will provide the pressures from the outside at least a little more influence on this matter.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar must stop the supply of weapons into Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 borders with the exchange of parts of the country and sharing Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside must also push for the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
It would be for the creation of a palestinian state has done more than the immediate offer of virtual statehood in the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of it, how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term dereliction of performance of its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be equally reluctant in its entry into the process.
It is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
That means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the entry into force of the laws of the bad cigarette packs
The nevzhledných green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, are depicted the warnings for smokers and the sick part of the body.
The entry into force of the australian laws of the bad packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and the colour of logos and brands to replace the general olive green boxes with a gruesome pictures of diseased parts of the body and the display of the children and infants diseased as a result of the smoking of their parents.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are required from Saturday, the only difference between the boxes of brand names, which are printed in the same small print.
This is the most stringent regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking, a habit of his attraction.
He relies on studies show that when people start smoking by the age of 26 years, is a 99% chance that never start smoking.
`` Even in very small children, you can see, that means the message of the tobacco companies to jointly with its product to sell, ''says Federal Minister for Health and Tanya Plibersek cites studies, for example, have shown that the children of joining the crown in the logo with the idea of what it takes to be a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest levels of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
The tobacco companies argued that this law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to lower-priced and dostupnějším cigarettes.
`` This legislation is a serious neúmyslným consequences, ''says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia have brought much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Others argue that the laws have increased their shops.
Sandra ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand on cigarette packaging of silicon used to cover the unsavoury boxes, two months ago, when the British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost its appeal on laws to Australia's Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
Ha, stated that the company Zico sold almost 6 000 wholesale sellers and expects the new supplies.
For us, it is a good deal.
As a potential setback experts argue the popularity of social media in that demographic group, which focuses on the plan.
After a whole series of australian laws prohibiting television advertising, sponsorship of sporting events and demanding that the majority of vendors and cigarettes before the direct gaze, the tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia banned the online advertising by local companies and Internet sites, but can not restrict foreign websites.
`` If you are a marketing worker in the tobacco industry, and you have only this little room for the promotion of your products, is for you online space intractable place in which you want to be, ''says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the field of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the assessment of the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by `` mediocre crawfish. ''
We need to ask, it's just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave the work and made this video, or that are involved in the company?
British American Tobacco Australia, argues that the industry focused on how to deal with the new rules, than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far that paid in Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new regulations-countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation, declaring that the trade is unfairly limited, despite the fact that none of the countries with Australia significantly traded.
The decision rendered SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek, says that the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar laws relating to the packaging.
Canada was the first country in 2001 introduced mandatory alert photograph.
Now widened to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The stricter laws think Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia he resists.
The pictures I have no influence.
Just ignore them.
`` You just pull out a cigarette box and put back, ''says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photograph of the tumour in his mouth.
Frankly, there's only one reason to quit smoking, and it's my little girl.
James Yu, who owns trafiku King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, argues that, thanks to the uniform packs for him is hard to match the shelves.
`` Offloading cargo took me one hour, now it takes me four hours, ''said Yu.
`` The government would simply have to prohibit, then we will say, ok, it's over, close up shop,''' he said, and threw up his hands.
In a world of constant connection is not so bad as to be bored
The last day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane mechanical problems, and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Wait for half a day at the airport on the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iphone (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts in child development increasingly come with praise for the nudění.
They say that for us (and our children) is good sometimes bored.
It makes the brain to go to interesting directions, which may encourage creativity.
And whereas most of us today is constantly connected to a screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the boredom.
So we should support the boredom?
Yes.
And no.
But I will come back to this.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the arrival of more free time.
But, says Peter Toohey, a professor of greek and roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, who is the author of the book: Boredom and lively history (the history of boredom) (Yale University Press, 2011).
`` In fact, he has a long history of boredom, ''he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found in the latin inscription on the boredom, originating in the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define boredom.
The trouble is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, ''said John D. Eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After seeing the research literature and bringing the idea of the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as experience `` I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to. ''
The boredom of apathy differs from that person is involved, but I wanted to be.
He says that there is apathy of the urge to do something.
He says that the core of the boredom is a `` distortion of the process of attention, with a bad mood and feeling slow time. ''
Boredom can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that, while they may have a relationship have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, he sees the problem within ourselves.
Sometimes we think we are boring, when we have trouble with concentration.
In his study, `` the Unengaged Mind: defining Boredom in terms of attention '', which was published in September in perspectives on Psychological Science journal, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, the person who read an article from the magazine.
Some groups have heard loud and related to the television program in the next room, others heard him so low that it barely noticed, while a third group heard at all.
Those who heard the television program quietly, reported the boredom of greater than the other two groups-had problems with concentration, but were not sure why these difficulties and attributed to boredom.
When you are trying to focus on the difficult task of distortion or engaging, can lead to boredom attention, said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you are doing something boring, `` as is the search for the bad parts on sidin line, may help rozptylující music, so bored. ''
In fact, he said, we now know that kroucení and čmárání, which is often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help with boredom and fight to keep people physically attentive.
`` Research shows that children who are allowed to shake, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still, ''said Professor Fenske.
All we have ever experienced boredom-delay in my flight, roaring speaker, especially the lengthy film.
But some individuals have a greater chance of getting bored than others.
For help with the measurement of boredom, scientists in the 1980 s, developed the `` scale for susceptibility to nudění ''(Boredom Proneness Scale).
Scale includes questions like: `` many of the things I need to do, repeated and is monotonous, ''and `` I have so many interests, that I do not have the time to do it all.''
By using these scales, the researchers found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida and, in particular, the need to have more and different external stimulation.
Teenagers are, however, generally impassive.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents indicated that they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent reported that they were bored, when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents reported that they were bored.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of boredom was now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
He said, however, that he knows that `` growing up is the peak period for boredom '', which is largely due to the fact that the children and young people is not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: `` it's good for you boring? ''.
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form may lead people to undergo a grotesque physical risks, playing games or using addictive substances, as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discussed on the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the problem after more than two decades.
`` Boredom is the way the brain, how to tell you that you should do something else, ''said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain does not always know the most useful thing you should do.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar and cooking, you will be happy to do it.
However, if you are watching tv, do you joy just for a moment, not in the long term.
So if your child bored and you give the iPad, I will not get bored, but to learn how to attach itself or separately, said Professor Fenske.
`` And this separate procedures is transmitted from one situation to the other, ''he said.
Your child is only to learn how to attach itself, but the gains greater restraint in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to celebrate the boredom.
But we are not even against her should not be too critical.
Our objective should rather feel comfortable when we are out of the reach of the constant chatter and technology.
Professor Eastwood said.
`` We are accusing her of the need to get bored more, but boredom is painful, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful, ''he said.
It's what people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy the free time.
`` In an environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní, ''he said, `` it's hard to find ways to be seized, when the noise shuts down.''
In Colorado, there's no manual on the new law on marijuana
19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a student at a vocational school and soccer player from the south-east of Colorado, facing a charge of crime for something that will soon be in the whole state legal-for possession of a few grams of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke.
Mr Orozco said that one day the September rode with a few friends in Lamaru, on the plains, near the border with Kansas, when he was stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco was issued a summons for possession of drug paraphernalia and the use of drugs-petty crimes, which is fine for every $100-and he was set the date of the court.
`` They treated us like criminals, ''said Mr Orozco.
But it's a criminal?
In the weeks after the vote on the Colorado legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use depends on the answer of hundreds of smaller drug cases, rather than on the spot on the right.
Hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana was already here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
Police departments stopped blaming the adult in the age of 21 years and older for possession of small quantities, which will be legally permitted after the law in the coming weeks will enter into force.
But prosecutors in the District of Colorado konzervativnějších declared that will continue with existing cases involving marihuany, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains votes on the prevention of the opening of the new state licensed shops with marijuana in their communities.
`` This matter is evolving so quickly that I do not know what's going to happen, ''said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
The heads of the hall-jogging and regulators in Washington State.
And they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licences for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of all-the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether good or bad, is ahead of the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana, first for medical use, and now even recreational.
`` Colorado has regulovanější market, so it will be a good guide, ''said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for the granting of licences to sell alcohol in Washington State.
But as Mr Smith admitted, no place or the system can not do more than design, what might work.
`` There is no real precedent for us to follow, ''he said.
Washington's law, the so-called I-502, becomes effective on December 6, which also leaves the annual vacuum, during which there will be another state licensing system, but the legal possession, yes.
And there are zapeklité mechanical issues that must be resolved during this period, for example, how to balance the directive to state on the `` appropriate approach ''to the licensed marijuana with his trade ban with hemp to 330 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
`` There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with hemp than in urban areas, and in particular in the Seattle metropolitan area, ''said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for legal hemp, recently based research group.
21 November sent police chief Oates from the city of Aurora officers e-mail, in which he announced that the city's already will not prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for every citizen in the age of 21 years and that the police `` with immediate effect ''to stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said that the police will promote the city laws regulating the growers of medical marijuana, and that it will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In the district of Weld in Northern Colorado represents the District Attorney Ken Buck stricter look.
After the vote, he said that his office will continue to prosecute cases of possession of marijuana, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
It is currently facing charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana 119 people, many of them facing another charge.
`` Our office is obliged to prosecute crimes charges, which were offences at a time when they occurred, ''said Mr Buck in its statement.
The reaction was complicated, in places like rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a joint initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, already grown-up blaming for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
`` I do not think that I am losing my time continuing in law enforcement, until the change, ''he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported coloradských measure, bringing the recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system is never easy.
And contradictory reactions across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
For the county prosecutors, it is `` the cultural barrier, ''said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, which stands accused of possession of marijuana, and a local spokesman for the National Organisation for the reform of the laws concerning the marijuana.
`` They spent so much of his life in his prosecution of people that still can not really accept that it's legal, ''he said.
As the first states to a small quantity of marijuana as opposed to alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become a national test cases for the legalization of the drug.
Advocates and government authorities plan a new frontier for legalizovaný sale and also anxiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which still has the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Advocates for legalization of marijuana, hoping that the Ministry of Justice to cave in.
Despite the arrest of several vendors of marijuana for medical purposes, and patients who use that drew attention, leaving most of the federal government deals with medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and the other 16 states in the operation.
While the drug-enforcement agents agents are likely to break down the door to catch a small bag with a drug, it is likely that the rebel providing State regulated business with recreational marijuana allowed new laws, said Kevin Sabet, a former adviser in the field of drug policy administration of President Obama.
Several coloradských cities for the procedure to federal authorities.
Before election day, some local governments approved a moratorium on any new business with marijuana, though it will take more than a year, he will be able to open any trade.
Last week, the city of Montrose in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban, and it is likely that next week will enter into force.
`` We do not want to find yourself in a situation where someone's head and then we will have a big federal, ''said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this addition.
We look at it, what they voted for the municipality, contrary to what the state has voted.
There are many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: `` I have been forced to leave out of Oxford, because I am a conservative. ''
For their views are not only attacked today's college students.
I do not remember that I would ever dream of studying at the University of Oxford.
As my father, my older brother to study at the university, which I thought was the world's largest based knowledge, modern ovíněné greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And while I am at the end of the 1980 s, within two weeks of the worcester College, where I wanted to study history, packed suitcases and stormed into the first scandal of his life.
My father broke down and wept.
My friends were confused.
The diary of the Evening Standard, he said, that I gave it up, because I had opposed the love of students in the next room.
The writer a. N. Wilson playfully said that I left because I was forced to drink from a chipped mugs.
The truth was less comical.
I ran.
Yes, I ran away, because I was the subject of a systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of alleged enlightenment that was both bigotní, so barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I am a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may ask, why bring this up until now.
Just because the latest reports suggest that the new generation of students right from the centre of the suffering similar persecution.
Institutionalised and growing hatred of conservative students at Oxford, is so great that last week, a group of these students sought the same protection of equal rights, gay people, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Association of younger (JCR) at Corpus Christi College, argues that because of his political views are `` often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made clear that they were not welcome. ''
Applying for a position in a university committee for equal opportunities to ensure that their views are free to communicate.
Their situation did not help recently the documentary for BBC two with the name of Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right fairyland: young, intelligent and right-wing) on student politics, the conservative described as odd and neo-Nazis.
The show was introduced to graduate Joe Cooke, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (Oxford University Conservative Association-OUCA), who rode, - Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and had the staff with a silver head.
On other universities conservative students say that is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees, treated as `` scapegoats ''.
20-year-old Luke Black, Vice President of Nottingham University Conservative Association (Conservative Association nottinghamské University), said nedělním newspaper that `` the left-wing influence at universities.
People think that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us ever met. ''
Salachup history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that the climate is `` unpleasant '', while the 19-year-old elected president Stephanie OUCA Cherill, says that in the approach of the JCR against people right from the centre of the deterioration.
`` It poses a threat to the atmosphere of the debate, as well as for the welfare of the members, ''he says.
During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I got on in September 1986, the 18-year-old and the crippling way shy.
The hatred against Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
The year before University voted through the refusal of the honorary title of the former student, Margaret Thatcher, because of cuts in funding for higher education.
From the atmosphere would be even stalinists shaking with fear.
During the first few days in a week, when the new students meet among themselves and with professors, I got a taste of the sage, which should have come.
I found that not only professors silently approving popichování conservative pupils, but with gusto, it also participate.
The paneled rooms was a policy of the miner's strike, privatisation and the resistance of the government to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture involved a french translation of the text from the 18 th century into English and what followed, I was not ready.
`` Miss Wyatt, ''said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), `` please, fold the first paragraph.''
It's hard.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face like a dortové dough, was žlučovitý a lot.
`` Thatcherovci refuse to learn french, or are just stupid? ''he asked.
Other students snickered.
Tears in my eyes.
`` I suggest, in his spare time, took a basic lesson of French, so if you are not too busy social issues, ''said Professor Pitt.
She was back to her room.
At a dinner in school, I was sitting alone, when I felt a light tap on the shoulder.
It was a sophomore on behalf of James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
`` I know who you are, ''he said softly.
Unfortunately, it's true.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism, is the target.
For me, it's pretty bad, but I know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be even worse.
Most conservative freshmen, pretending to be Labour.
Later, in a local pub I cravenly tried to pretend.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
First-year student scope of philosophy, politics and economics, which (how ironic) went to Eton, he said: `` you are the daughter of the Fascist pig. ''
You are infected.
Other students with him notovali.
I was sick, dirty.
`` As conservatives love? ''one asked.
Hitting each other, right?
I felt so as to feel homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960 s.
I can sometimes result in Oxford normal life?
I was forced to meet with like-minded people just after dark?
I'd have to change the labouristu and suppress their natural tendencies?
Three years before me developed a purgatory ignored and isolation.
The only openly conservative Professor Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, which housed at my school.
It was hated not only that it is conservative, but also that it is an adviser to Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy and one of those who write speeches.
Almost there.
That place hated for its parochialism and pettiness and for his drive marxisticko-deterministickému view of history.
In 1997, he joined the place, a professor at the University of turkish Bilkentské in Ankara.
`` You will not be happy here, ''he told me.
I started to commute from Oxford to her parents' house in London, seeking refuge in its neutral Metropolitans of friends and family.
I told my father, I hate that Oxford and why.
I could not believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940 s were accepted by all political views.
`` But it's the best place in the world, ''said pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city of dreamlike mood.
Even my communist friends had always exquisite manners.
His wet eyes looked sullen.
Try it again.
I am sure it's just a joke.
Would break my heart, if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London to my emotional resistance to deteriorate.
My friend, also a friend of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
The following week in the course of instruction, when another history professor in utter seriousness, he said that `` the enemy of the people '', I decided to do the same.
Even when I am inside the red with shame, I confessed to me that the parents `` brainwashed ''and I called them `` old fogies.''
The relief was short-lived.
Hřebík into the coffin of my career, Oxford drove my father.
At that time, he wrote every week two columns into Murdochových newspapers.
My door was locked.
I crouched inside and after five minutes, I gave up my pursuers.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me usmrkaným wimp.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be in the educational institution such intimidation and venom.
More tragic, however, is that it was the Oxford, of which not only produced 14 conservative prime ministers, but also to date, hiding behind the reputation of the place undue with equality and freedom of thought.

The hardest job in the world: the bearers of sulphur in Kawah Ijen volcano area
Four euro gamble porters in Indonesia volcano with his life and health, when they endure 70 pounds of sulphur down the steep stone paths.
There are people, for their work in hell, and there are those who actually work in hell.
That's the case, one of the Anta Wijayi 400 miners who make their living by the conquest of the sulphur volcano on the indonesian island of Kawah Ijen East Java.
Because every day until fárat at the bottom of the crater, where sulfur gases escape from the interior of the country and in contact with air passes into a solid state.
After the cut in large blocks of sulphur, weighing up to 70 pounds, takes them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets after steep stone paths.
At the top of the mountain, which rises 2 386 yards, it's only 250 metres, but exhausted porters takes over 40 minutes up tortoise pace up because they hold the balance and thoroughly rozvažují steps to neuklouzli and crashing into the abyss.
They know that any confusion, it could become a life, how it happened one French turistce that years ago fell from cliffs Kawah Ijen.
The miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every pound of sulphur that mine
When you are at the top, making their way past the tourists, who took photographs of them, as if they were a monkey in the circus, carrying heavy baskets and wearily to the weight of the mining company placed somewhat lower, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is a firm PT Candi Ngrimbi, which benefit from a volcano in 1960 and never pay their workers more than 662 indonesian rupees (five cents) a kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry, as this rock has its place in the day-to-day life and is used for the production of matches, amusing pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
`` Because they are commonly worn 70 pounds, we make about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million) for each way, ''explains us anto, which usually carried three trips a day.
One way it takes three hours, and at the end of it is damaged, but he can then earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although it seems like a negligible amount so inhuman effort, it's three times what they would have earned on the field.
`` The daily wage of miners here is very high, for example, for the collection of coffee to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for a fortnight's two million rupees (167), ''explains the porter, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary, 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the work was so heavy, but anto returned with her family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as Sulphur: `` I am married with a young girl from Bali, which is a Hindu, and I took her to Java, converted to Islam. ''
Anto has asthma, it was hard to breathe, still coughing and sore eyes toxic gases
In his 27 years anto three times daily risking his life in Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulphur he had begun to take their toll, although the face mask and protected special glasses.
Has asthma, breathing, coughing and sore eyes toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
It's the price we must pay for it to achieve his dream.
`` I will work for two more years, because I want to open a store or study spanish or french, ''promises more than passable English.
This handsome and intelligent young man with a fate could be a guidebook, waiter or porter at the hotel, and instead of doing the work of the medium.
Shares of dirty wooden shack with other media and every day gets up at two in the morning, because sulfur in the night and continues to ooze out of her characteristic yellow color changes in blue and glow in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness into the crater and fárá anto lights the way a small lamp, which has a fixed on his helmet and he bought it for their money.
About 400 delivery order on the shoulders of the basket with sulfur from the bottom of the crater
Although the company has high revenues, the extraction of sulphur due to cost savings nezmechanizovala or porters working on his own and with such zeal, no equipment.
Actually, do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the bonus for photography, together with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1,2) collected watchers of the National Park from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and her human mules.
`` This work is for cattle, and not for people, ''argues Madrusin, a 42 year-old carrier, who works in Kawah Ijen already for three decades, ever since he left school.
 Can lift up to 110 pounds and assures us that the last work, `` as long as possible '', because he needs the money for the education of their three sons, aged between 18 and 10 years.
I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life
Although the sulphur burn his throat and eyes sting, when the wind suddenly turns and traps the miners in the thick of the fumes from the volcano, based on the miners are so tough that no one of them complaining that suffered serious diseases … but it is clear from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis, pain, knee and shoulder wounds caused by the weight of the baskets.
Unainik, which balances its basket on his back, in its 53 years may deal only 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his colleagues vydolují volcano in 15 tonnes of sulphur, then three trucks carry a steep path between a warehouse in Tamansari far 18 miles.
`` I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life, ''says Unainik opens his mouth wide and, in which the missing several teeth.
The oldest of his five sons, 30-year-old, also makes mining of sulphur.
Time passes, but the continuing misery of one of the most painful crafts in the world remains from generation to generation-trades, which perform a human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singapurci pin that have no children, career, stress, and the cost of living and education.
`` The population of Singapore needs to grow. ''
I am married and I am a patriot, you are my wife and you are a patriot. accomplish your civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem that this slogan is part of the advertising peppermint candy, but despite-or perhaps because of it-with the video at the beginning of this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
These sentences are part of the rap, which uses local hints of `` bun in the oven ''as a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
BUT, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes that this advertising can highlight the problem of humorous manner.
The art director of the Agency's Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the influence of music for people to meet their `` civic duty ''.
`` It is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we had the feeling that this is a subject which need to touch.
We knew that the government is trying to extend a lot of things like perfume with pheromone or organise seznamovací parties.
Many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not make that nejkreativnější thing, as is the composition of the rap to solve this problem. ''
1.2 children '
It's taken too lightly, is the government of Singapore.
A year makes 1 USD 300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government package for marriage and family provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extended maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures but had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city-state with advanced technology in south-east Asia, also known as conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the stratification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the fertility rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered to be a degree of recovery, in 1976.
Why Singapurci have more children?
Tan Wei Mingová, Director of the Department of marriage and the family of the National Office for the population, says that it's because of the `` education ''and `` a wider range of career opportunities''.
`` People are available to a wider range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, it's only a wedding and family, ''he explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and fathered children. the result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While the immigration policy, there were attempts to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against a decline in population between residents of this caused resentment.
On some of the Singapore website is to see the overt xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are criticized for maintaining low salaries and little attempt to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the last year recorded a party of government in Singapore on your worst election result since the beginning of independence.
After the election appeared to tackle the problem by using quotas and higher charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known the impact of the national economic growth, tax revenue, healthcare spending and immigration policy, in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government tries to be erected so many small houses.
For example, began to affect the real estate business.
The Office for urban development began to regulate the number of small apartments, known as `` the shoebox '', which could be built in some urban areas.
These flats have area 46 square meters and had great success in marketability.
However, there is concern that these flats can support the bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general developer company El Developers, says that their `` shoeboxes ''sold far faster than the larger houses.
`` They are increasingly popular, and that it will be sold in the days to weeks faster than houses with greater scale.
Therefore, they are our cash flow much better. ''
However, the new standards provide clearer rules for developers, who were previously limited, if they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed
Singapore is the city state.
Although these new rules could aim to increase the birth rate in the nation, the conversation with Singapurci working in the financial district in the centre of the city, suggests that they will not have a big effect.
`` People are still under stress, the houses are expensive, as well as education, therefore, that many people back, ''says the young officer.
`` The rest of them are children.
But it's important for me to rely on their own time and money, ''says another, about 20-year-old, young man.
Both men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So the government is trying to citizens in any way to force them to have children, they are still ultimately Singapurci, who have the last word on the founding family.
What's private is private online and offline
Privacy.
According to the dictionary, published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something that is personal in nature or the `` area of private life, which has every right to protect against any disruption. ''
What's the privacy for a man aged 16 years?
How to apply this definition in its day-to-day life and on social networks?
Understands the dangers to which it is exposed, as published on the Internet, which would be sure to anyone in the routine communication told?
Journalists from elPeriódico interviewed five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four of the cases considered the notion of privacy for the `` something ''in his own personal level and for `` user name and password,'' was a social networks.
`` He has the greatest secret would be disclosed, ''he says of the ten-year-old Jorge in an attempt to explain the importance of privacy in places such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, which accounts for the past two years.
`` They are very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world, ''he says.
`` FB give pretty pictures or photos, how we play.
He also says there with friends.
I would share a picture that was not my picture, or that someone made a fool, ''he says.
This boy, he realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, pictures of naked people or pictures of the crimes, or write humiliating or coarse comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends on FB and its nine fans on Twitter.
Most are related.
Among them is the mother who has a name and password of one of the accounts.
`` I created an account on Twitter to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I do not know if someone says,'I just give, ''added.
`` Social networks are amusing, can speak with relatives, who are far or fast to communicate with friends, ''he says.
Without hesitation, he says, that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
Nor would he care if he had recommended a stranger.
The case of a fourteen-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager owns Hotmail accounts on the networks, Facebook, we Space and Ask and at last the network admits that he does not know the 20 people from his list of friends.
`` I am not afraid of that, because we have something in common, such as music, ''he says.
Under this boy him none of them nothing, not even after nenaváděl would address or phone number.
`` If me or it from me, it's simply not from your account to remove, ''she admits.
José signed on to ask, after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
This boy is not foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying kyberšikana ().
`` Intimate friends on the social network was being blackmailed.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who he was, ''confirms.
The victim is under José check out of the account.
`` He just activated the private system. ''
Then he explains a series of steps, as an account set up safely.
Unlike Jorge this boy published pictures of acquaintances in unpleasant or trapných situations.
`` Of course I'd done it, if someone-or I just wanted to.
Even though I know it's cyberbullying, ''he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porrasová, english teacher and graduate business education and teaching, to children and adolescents in social networks correctly, they must understand that the main aim of these networks is to inform.
States that: `` the Internet as a resource for finding information, but when he appeared on social networks, the rules of the game changed. ''
Marrielos Porrasová notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the digital natives and digital immigrants, led these concepts to this phenomenon explained.
`` Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are the digital immigrants, who they have to learn, and he only teach themselves, ''he says.
He explains that it is a difficult subject, `` because we ask them to distinguish what is appropriate to spread, publish and say, and what not, in an age when you are not yet mature. ''
Also, what concerns the surroundings-slow, at a time when it most wants is to be popular, thousands of friends and not think about the consequences, ''he adds.
Under this specialistky is the most effective way to children and adolescents to show what it's privacy, asking questions, making them think.
`` Tell them to do something, it does not work, ''he adds.
Further Marrielos Porrasová lists some of the options: there are things that are stranger listened, then why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or: would you like it if someone posted a picture of you as you published a comrade?
Do you know what the others published?
When you call the person in the photos of the celebrations, did you ask these persons on permission?
And one more: the need to know what they are doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to act in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
It's the same rules.
`` The man is out of respect for the Internet, morals and other principles and the same should be on social networks, ''he says.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational consultant, explains that it is essential that the parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
`` If you understand the intricacies of every single, have a good basis to children, talking about the consequences of the account on the internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish, ''he says.
 Guardia is of the opinion that it is crucial to remind the children of the traditional rule `` do not talk to strangers. ''
The summit of South America ends and the declaration of Lima was found
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru today ended without a statement from Lima, which was Staged and which was allegedly signed by seven present presidents.
The agency Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed by the sixth meeting of heads of state and government and the organisation of Unasur, but representatives of the Foreign Ministry and the presidential office, who, at the beginning of the set, that document published after the end of the summit, said that will later be published on the website of the peruvian government.
Furthermore, they argued that the content was published by peruvian President Ollantou Humalou in a few short press statements.
Journalists throughout the summit, limited access to information.
During the hearing in the press room live video from the presidency of the Assembly without sound with the message `` confidential meetings, transferring audio prevented. ''
A small amount of information that reporters had available, was given the news speakers of some governments, who were attending the meeting, but not the peruvian spokesman.
The only document published during the hearing was a list of participating in the presidents, which led to the displeasure of hundreds of journalists from the various national and international media, who asked for more information.
Later sent the peruvian presidential office media e-mail, `` the final declaration of the summit, but it is just an expression of President Humala, and not an official document, the summit concluded.
Last October, the host city of Peru, the third summit of south american and arab countries (América del Sur-Países Árabes ASPA), and not on this occasion was originally promised declaration from Lima, although it was published in the press eagerly required.
On the official website of ASPA can find out that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings to seek the peruvian authorities to ensure the broadcast for all journalists, but to prevent the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to the adoption of the judgment of the Court of Justice in the Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
President Ollanta Humala, Peru and Chile President Sebastián Piñera met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which starts on Monday, listening for making speeches of both parties to discuss the dispute, which launched the Lima against Santiago.
`` Conquer and do a judgment that will solve the dispute that today in the international court discussing, ''said President Humala, together with his chilean counterpart.
`` Chile was, and is, and the country will be respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, conventions and international courts, ''said Piñera and greeted the president at Humalu grip the flags of both countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents, subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week adopted bogotský pact, which expressed its submission by the rulings of the international court, which ruled on the sea border with Nicaragua, Colombia and this decision considered entirely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff) Venezuely (Hugo Chávez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchnerová).
Paraguay has been excluded from the Organisation of Unasur in 2011, following an appeal by the then President Fernando Lugo and did not take part in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with the start of the morning of speeches and completion of the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, which informed that it was adopted 16 agreements and was scheduled to work on 31 projects between the south american countries, with investments of $17 billion.
In addition to the adopted agreements mentioned that the member countries of the Organisation of UNASUR take `` important steps towards the goal in the form of american citizenship, which extended the agreement on residency. ''
Informed that supported the actions to improve the `` cooperation in the fight against the civil insecurity and international organised crime, the improved availability of medicines and low-priced Internet in all parts of South America and the common and effective measures against the risks of natural disasters. ''
If Europe is in crisis, `` does not have the economic consolidation (Latin America), winning the substance, but should serve to expand our productivity and show our nations, a better future, ''added Humala.
`` We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 symbolic projects, which will improve transport links to various places in South America, especially in rural and border areas … to our countries were better integrated and created a new economic ties, ''stated in čteném speech peruvian president.
I mentioned that five of these projects by Peru and transverse OS its territory from the coast of Brazil, and the other two are better connections with Ecuador, more details but indicated.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
`` We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to her return to the Union of South American Nations, ''from which it is now excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted the summit was the need to Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area, which is solid and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, he said the colombian President Juan Manuel Santos before its participation in the regional meeting hopes on Saturday in Mexico would meet nikaragujským counterpart Daniel Ortega, with respect to discuss the decision of the International Court of Justice on the dispute over maritime borders, which is disputed Bogotou.
`` It's possible that tomorrow (Saturday) to meet with President Daniel Ortega, ''Santos said.
`` We will discuss all of the solutions, none are excluded, no contract with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country, ''he said.
`` I hope I will be able to say the President Ortega to negotiations and what led nejcivilizovanější nejohleduplnější possible form, ''said Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where he attended the inauguration of President there Enriqueho Peñi Niety.
In the context of the summit, the EU defence ministers met to provisionally approved the action plan for 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in the defense area.
Members of the Organisation of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the last of the country is currently excluded.
Peru is a temporary chairman of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe '
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the objective, in which the `` South America, in this case really must learn from Europe. ''
Correa, who was involved in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations Presidential (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television tv Perú that Europeans, `` kill the World War ''and in other conflicts, `` but now they are practically one country.''
In this sense, defended the project of a south american citizenship, the member countries of the Organisation of Unasur support.
`` It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in the context of any country, which is already underway between members of the Andean Community, however, there are more reactionary areas that we want to go back to the past, ''he said.
Ecuadorian President, inter alia, that he agrees with the reorganisation of the Organisation of American States (OAS) under the condition that it be reduced the influence of anglo-saxon countries and take into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
`` Those who are in the lead, never to oblige, and we all signed the South Americans instead.
It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington, financed by the United States, ''he said, referring to the political asylum by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
President Correa, confirmed that this decision does not regret, because it had betrayed their principles, and respected his `` deep democratic values and human rights ''.
Said at the time that there was `` credible allegations that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process. ''
In addition, criticised the swedish justice, who asked him to the swedish territory subjected the testimony of alleged sexual offense, while `` the swedish legislation makes the questioning of videokonferenčním conversation, which might take place from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. ''
Correa said that there is a risk that Assangeho worsening physical and mental health.
`` I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but Ambassador informed me that he has little lung problems, but nothing serious, ''said Ecuador's head of state.
`` But that his physical and psychological condition worsens, because it is closed on a small space without the possibility of movement in the fresh air.
That would mark the health of everyone, ''he said.
President Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June on ekvádorském embassy in London, on the basis of the permit, which enables him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, and stressed that the London talks to resolve the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
`` We are not negotiating on human rights, that word in this case to use, but still continued talks.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the european courts, because Assangeův lawyer Baltazar Garzón leads the series of proceedings at the various european instances, ''he said.
Stated that `` if Britain issues to pass, will all end. ''
And if Sweden Mr Assangeho hears the ekvádorském embassy in London or via Skype, as no problem on its legislation and, as has been done in other cases, this problem will be carried out. ''
Correa took advantage of the situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and explained that, certainly not tolerate `` podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie, that undermine the freedom of expression. ''
The greatest enemies of a free press, are not we, the mean-spirited and perverse politicians, but the bad press in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail, ''he said.
From this point of view, expressed joy that no such journalists, `` not the bankers, not hegemonní countries and even buržoazie proficient in Ecuador, ''and said that, if elected, `` will continue to change by the right way and in the right direction.''
President Correa also supported the decision on maintaining the veto of the equivalent of Paraguayi on Union membership Unasur, at least in its next election, arguing that the whole `` must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus wrapped into the legality '', because, in fact, `` destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy. ''
Ecuadorian President also alleged that as `` entirely appropriate ''wish of his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries now, in the period after the judgment of the international court in the Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
Currently, the judgment is not accepted.
`` It's a problem between the south american country and the Central American.
The conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome will walk together.
They need to be assessed, to be overcome and the possibility to go forward. ''
It also expressed the hope in the settlement of the maritime border, which deals with the same court in Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that `` for Latin America's right to seek international instances, if both countries commit to accept the judgment, no matter how much hard. ''
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador, to run in the order of a third mandate, he said, that he sees this option `` with great optimism and joy, even when it is sometimes very hard. ''
Correa said that, if in February 2013 choice loses, leaves from public life.
`` Personally, I never cared much, but as unfair situation as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador, he can repair the only political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guarantees this likely victory, so we have to take this responsibility, ''he said.
`` If I had won, it would be my last presidential term, and then I went from the policy.
If we lose, I am going to be the same thing.
I had already decided, ''he said.
Correa also mentioned on the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
`` I just spoke with the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolásem Madurem, who says that President Chávez went on a planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the state of health of the president, ''he said.
The head of the Ecuadorian State today for the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was topped by calling for greater regional integration in order to maintain the development, equality and safety.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabriziovi was 21 years, when it was confirmed the result of his test: HIV positive.
`` It was like a bolt of lightning struck me, ''he says, remembering the moment of truth, the doctor tried to `` softening '', but apparently without success.
The boy before the family secret.
He decided to take his disease alone on their shoulders, and began to inform it with such commitment that he celebrated his birthday. 43.
It is undoubtedly one of the patients nejdávnějších unit of HIV in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), which came in 1994 after a battle with the disease.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years, which were unimaginable in the early 1990 s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.
Then, with even the director of the clinic in Mexico's Institute of Social Security (IMSS) farewell, `` because he had cut ''.
Then have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible with this syndrome to survive and to live.
However, it's a lot of people who do not know about my illness and come up when the virus caused the destruction of the organism in himself and the immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since the world appeared disease AIDS, or at least since the first documented cases, `` means a great success, that the life expectancy of the patient, timely and appropriate manner with treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people, ''said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the unit of HIV in the civilian hospital in Guadalajara, that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Infektolog and specialist on HIV / AIDS Andrade Villanueva explained that the scientists concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability in the immune system, which is the illness diagnosed, the better they are on those who use drugs: people with 200 cd 4 cells can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cd 4 cells for up to 50 years.
Put simply, this means that those who have been diagnosed with HIV in 25 years, according to these knowledge `` in compliance with the therapy to live without the problems of up to 75 years, ''explained in an interview with the doctor.
To highlight this progress, it should be noted that the average life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although mortality significantly in recent years, and in the case of Mexico, the number of people who have died of AIDS, from 6 678 in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV / AIDS-UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of the AIDS deaths, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of the patients.
Only in the state of Jalisco died in 2011 255 people and in May of this year, yet 187. however, since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretroviral.
 - Why do you continue to people on the consequences of the disease die?
 `` It seems to me that the problem is not in the possibilities of access to treatment.
The way I see it, that's the way it is with us in the hospital.
For at least the past 12 years, we have exhausted supplies of the drug problem is that patients come in very advanced stage, because they do not know the status of the disease, or in a late stage of the disease. ''
Adds a convincing entry: `` nine out of ten patients comes, he will take some associated infection. the only thing, what needs to be done in order to affect the overall mortality rate is more illness before the diagnosis, and therefore should be on a large scale to offer tests to assess the disease to all persons who request it. ''
In its proposal coincides with the specialists and officials from the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in the State of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to get into the private lab tests, just because it made his friend, and despite the low age he had a disease outbreak of AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, cancer, which is one of the most common complications.
`` Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die, and they do not want to know anything else.
`` If I have to die, I'd rather be vyřádím three times a week, ''they said, but it's not my case.
The change was better, healthy eating, exercise, take medicine. ''
Still, his parents knew only that he had suffered from cancer.
`` I live a normal life like everyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, travel, lead an active sex life, but in a responsible manner, I pay attention to himself and to the other person, ''lists Fabrizio, who accepted the invitation to share their experience on the MILENIO Jalisco, today in the context of World AIDS Day motivated the testimony of those who are afraid.
`` Let them keep do tests if risk, let them know as soon as possible if you are HIV positive, it's better, and if you have been diagnosed, whether they realize that they can live like anyone else, he will be responsible. ''
This note summarises the password of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Among the programmes for Health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar guadalajarský journalist who collected information on the HIV virus.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
In places, this task to give `` actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us the packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms, ''said.
Between nejnáchylnějšími to new diseases are adolescents.
`` What do you want it? ''is the question of the normal full of irony and assessment from social workers, school employees, consultants, pharmacies and medical personnel, the teenagers want to avoid, says the reporter.
He suggested this ineffective distribution of condoms are not just change, whether for consoles, but those hundred whether located in dávkovačích public toilet, in places frequented by young.
`` It's promoting promiscuity.
Do not get them to `` pay a beer and a motel, ''responded the Governor Emilio Gonzalez asked if he agreed with the distribution of condoms in his district.
It is not the best Takovásexualita. condoms available to those who have sex life, ''he said.
Key figures in the State of Jalisco
It was recorded 13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This means in Mexico, the fourth place in the new and recorded cases of AIDS and 13 in connection with HIV.
92% of the disease is sexual way, 6% blood y 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that, with the HIV virus can live about 50,000 people, because the one registered a case is four to five people who do not know about the disease.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring the company's bankruptcy in vitro by Grupo Mexico, causing an unfortunate precedent for any national firm with offices in a neighbouring country and the problem of solvency.
Therefore, it appears that the procedures of the restructuring of the companies, which allow mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes, despite international agreements.
The approval of the judgment on 15 June last year the judge Hal Harlinem in bankruptcy court for North Texas leaves in the practice of the mexican company without defence against the possibility of confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the mexican producer of glass doors to the Supreme Court of the United States, with an appeal against the three irregularities.
First, it should be noted that while the judge in this case, they argue that creditors by the Insolvency Act in the United States, the Court of Appeal the fifth district, located in New Orleans, says that the main procedure provides the bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
For one thing, it would indicate a procedural ignorance of international cooperation in cases of insolvency, the multinational companies.
In fact, he was the model for this purpose, created by the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the organisation of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment that without a vote of the branches of the internal corporate structure, which is recognised by the debt of the parent company in vitro to branches, would not be required majority for approval of the restructuring.
However, the possibility of the mexican laws allow.
The fact is that the case was not the first company in vitro, in which it was taken this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples like Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose in-house debts guaranteed Federal Institute of insolvency.
In addition, the truth is that even after deducting the votes of the branches of the creditors-who stood against the company in a court in the United States, i. e. funds `` vultures '', such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited-have a majority.
The vote would reach about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.
From another viewpoint accuses the court in the company of a difficult situation, which has faced since 2008-against the background of a serious economic crisis, which hit the United States.
In the meantime, the family firm Superior set lodges an appeal to the new assessment directly at the court of appeal to the examination was carried out with the full participation of the participation of the five judges, as originally voted only three.
If he fails, it will require a revision of the appeal process, a higher instance, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
The case is serious, that the court failed to document sent by the mexican government as a department of the amicus curiae, which is described in detail in vitro procedure the company under bankruptcy law and in which it points out that the company will ease, opted for the agreements signed by both countries, confronted the law with chapter 15 of the Insolvency Act in the United States.
Navícse points out that the country is subordinate to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules for international cases of insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The impact on both sides: the punishment for the company in the state.
The overall assessment
Unnoticed lay on the table for several months, the criminal complaint of mexican aviation unions against the former owner of the company, which was Gastónu Azcárraga Andrademu accused of fraud, and according to the trade union pilots vessel already overflowed.
The instance in the forehead with Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineauem just filed at the national banking Commission and the Commission for the securities, which blames the obstruction in the achievement of justice.
According to her, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General prosecution on a transaction of this professional, in which the bank from IXE fideikomisu f / 589 picked on behalf of the company's mexican aviation 198 million pesos.
The funds were likely to be directed to purchase shares of professional hotel management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
As is well known, the Azcárraga Andrade is the majority shareholder of the Hotel chain Posadas.
The siege of the Dragon Mart
In the area of the Universidad de Caribe over the weekend, met a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and ordinary citizens, who approved the creation of the association, in order to avoid opening up the chinese Dragon Mart in Kankúnu.
We talk about, you know, the huge trading and distribution center of the country with `` the Wall ''aimed at Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which included in the lower part of the residential zone for the staff of 150 companies.

`` Héctor Hetin ''Reyes: `` basketball was my life,''
Globe-trotting Héctor basketball `` Hetin ''Reyes was with this Salo's sport of more than 60 years and traveled with him to the entire world.
Few people in Puerto Rico has so many memories of the history of the local basketball, as has the Héctor `` Hetin ''Reyes.
Reyes was before him in 2008 by a stroke in a wheelchair, dedicated to the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of age categories, a basketball player of the National League BSN, owner and coach of the team Vaqueros de Bayamón in national basketball league, or the president of the Federation portorické basketball.
`` I served in the course of my life in a lot of basketball roles, including several at the same time as I was when I was in the 1990 s, the president of the National League BSN, General manager of the national team and the chairman of the Federation, ''recalled Reyes while visiting reporters newspaper Primera Hora home in Bayamónu, where he lived for more than 50 years with Isabel, his faithful wife.
`` Basketball was my life. ''
Reyes in his assertion exaggerated.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with pictures and objects from his long career, that story.
In the heart of Bayamón
With the greatest affection from all those guards, reminiscent of his tenure in Los Vaqueros since the mid-1950, where he was a player until 1982, when at the same time to celebrate 15 years as co-owner or the owner of the team.
`` It was my best years, that I am the most houses, because I had the opportunity to be with a team of Los Vaqueros from 1967 to participate in eight championship, either as the owner, the co-owner, or the coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
And then I am one Championships-in 1981, when the BSN debuted Jerome Mincy.
When the team took over `` Cuco ''Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader,'' said Reyes.
`` I remember that Gene Bartow, who was previously the coach and then worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said to me:'I am for you, the burly 6-foot player.
Do you want it? ''
And that was the beginning of the Mincyho, one of the best players ever to Puerto Rico.
Bartow me then recommended rozehrávače Raymond Gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best shooters.
I remember that he said that, if Mincy Bayamonu bring victory in the championship, then Gausse will contribute to the further. ''
Championship, when the team played for Los Vaqueros Gausse, enjoyed, but only at a distance, as in 1988, has served as the president of a basketball federation.
At that time, he wanted to devote their functions and enjoy Mincyho location in the national team.
`` I remember the first time we beat the United States in the Olympic qualification match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we are, but we had to have the bronze if it had not been for the canadian referee, who let us repeat the final face-off, ''said Reyes.
A team from the World Cup in 1990, the best of the national team, which you have ever seen?
It is among the best, like the one that defeated the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold, and we are the team out of the United States, which was quite similar to that which we blew a bronze at the World Championships.
The crew should not only Mincyho Gausseho, Ramona Rivase, Fico López and `` Piculína ''(Ortiz), but also there were young men (Javier) `` Toñito'' Colón and James Carter, brothers Leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario `` Quixote ''Morales, who could be in the team in 1990 because of a knee injury.
The team, which might have the perfect composition, but we managed to win the gold medal and bring great joy, a team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in argentine Neuquénu.
With the players on the roster, as they were `` Canito ''Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced players excluded because of a scuffle in panamerických games in Mar de Plata, despite all the predictions, won the gold.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was without any doubt Ortiz Piculín.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from Puerto Rico reached at this level as Piculín.
Not to mention his background in different leagues, where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
It's very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
The young I very much like the work of Leo Arilla.
The success of the Federation consider the greatest?
That I was part of the most famous of the era of the national team in the years from 1988 to 1995, and that in the early 1990 s was the National League BSN in one season to 17 teams.
 What did you do?
There are things I wanted to introduce, as a division of youth categories, according to the regions.
For example, that the boys from Ponce played only in its field and compete with teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the kids a lot of travel and play games, too, which is not necessary.
I also see a benefit in the compulsory certificates and courses for managers, assistants and the referee.
I am pleased.
What now?
The most I listen to music, watch YouTube videos with the music of my time, I enjoy the grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketbalové games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of his wife, Isabel, who had always been at my side.
