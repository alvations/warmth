Food responsible in European inflation
A principal reason for the increase measured in the eurozone of the inflation are the rapidly rising food prices.
In 13 lands of the eurozone the price increase was higher in November than expects - after which 2.6 percent in October an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was registered as the statistical office of the EU reports in Luxembourg.
Official predictions have gone out from only 3 percent, announced Bloomberg.
In contrast to American, British, and Canadian issuing bank the European central bank (EZB) has not lowered the Leitzsins. After your judgement the rising raw material prices and the light decline of the unemployment the origin of an inflation spiral would favor the lowering of interest rates.
The EZB is bestrebt to hold the inflation rate less than two percent, or at least briefly in the 2-percent brand.
According to an analyst the EZB is in the catch-22 situation: One must "arrange" the inflation to exclude later action need.
With 3.3 percent the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a twelve year-record high; in Spain climbed the rate from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Responsibly for the increase of the inflation in the eurozone are the risen food and energy prices.
The wheat quotations MATIF rose by 88 percent, and the course for soy beans likewise reached a record high since 1973.
Also with edible oil and milk products there was a considerable price increase in 2007.
The world price for crude oil rose this year by 52 percent - last month the price per barrel of the black gold reached nearly 100 USdollars.
The EZB according to will rise the inflation in 2008 from 2.1 to 2.5 percent, indeed, one counts in 2009 on a decline on 1.9 percent.
For the coming 3-4 months analysts go out from a 3-percent inflation rate, number the annual average rate, however, with 2.1 percent.
For 2008 experts calculate on the fact that the EZB will lower the interest twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnating the number of the Fidesz sympathizers has considerably grown till the beginning of December. First since 2002 the party disposes of the biggest base camp, while the approval has reached a never was there low from 13 percent for the socialists according to Gallup.
With the voters loyal to party the difference precipitates thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates clearly: More than two thirds (71 percent) face to a fifth (20 percent) of approval for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to survey under the parliamentary entrance hurdle: They come in the whole population on two percent.
The number of the party voters has grown in both camps about 1 percent.
In comparison to the last low the general economic mood has further got worse - never before was the interest of those which judge the economic situation of the land as " really badly ", so high (41 percent), while other 46 percent they hold for "quite bad".
After more hopeful views in the spring and summer the families see the change of her financial position once more more pessimistic.
For the next year the majority of the population counts on an other deterioration of the situation; only one tenth goes out from an improvement.
A Gallup survey carried out in December proved that 71% of the interviewees - a historical high - judged the work of the prime minister as " rather badly as right ".
Thirteen percent of the interviewees have big trust or trust in general in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the interest of the advocates puts out 38 percent for Viktor Orbán.
About 54% do not trust the head of the government at all, compared to 27% of mistrust of the party chief of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those, mine, one could gain control of the discontent with the Prime Minister also without change of government.
If still 35% had expressed themselves after the riots in the last October for the whereabouts of the government and the head of the government, today this interest amounts to only 20%, while the relative majority (33 percent) sees the solution only in new elections.
Asked according to her interest in the plebiscite 60 percent answered that they participate "with certainty", and other 20% would "probably deliver her vote.
To the comparison: if the parliamentary elections took place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go "with certainty" to the urns, other 15% hold her participation for "likely". In view of these trends the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable.
74% would become against the tuition fees, 79% against the practise fee, and tune 84% against the hospital-day money.
Jibed on the group in the plebiscite "with certainty" participant would become the shares of the opponents of the studies fees, practise fees and hospital fees even 81, 84, or 89 percent amount.
Auchan most expensive, Tesco raises by almost one fifth
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser commercial area have also maintained of this year the average price increase of 16% of the last year, with the difference that there was no rise of the value added tax of this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser commercial triangle the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" has also increased of this year about 16 percent, indeed, price increases were registered in all hypermarkets by more than 1,000 HOOFS.
After the prices are in the food markets in the last December "davongaloppiert", the price increase prozentuell has been not drastic, compared to the anyway high, earlier source level.
Indeed, it looks deterrent on the consumers certainly that that for what they had paid last year still far less than 9,000 HOOFS this year is not even available for 10,000 HOOFS.
The price of the "Napi" of goods basket crossed the magic 10,000-hoof border about at least 91 HOOFS in the examined markets.
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOFS.
(In 6800 the price lay with 6,800 HOOFS.)
The prices of Unicum and living fish remained nearly at year before level, have strongly risen, however, the prices of turkeys breast fillets, nut and poppy.
Prices of flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, nevertheless, with Auchan there was 1 kg of bread reveille for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive-conditioned steep fall in prices on less than 200 Forint with the product.
The price of two liters of Coca Cola security bottle of less than 200 Forint was likewise astonishing here, therefore the drink cost including security only 257 HOOFS.
Still cut of this year in the "Napi" goods basket-comparison Auchan most expensive, and Cora most for a good price from.
Our calculations have proved, that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket compared with the Christmas prices last year around 15, while Tesco and Auchan have raised in each case by 18 percent.
The difference between the cheapest goods basket of the year before and the most expensive one of the wine bar year amounted to 12%, while the rise put out 21% between the cheapest goods basket of the last year and most expensive of the current year.
The average rise in prices amounted to 1,480.00 HOOF.
The average price increase lay in the year before still with 1,206.00 Forint, indeed, the value added tax rise became apparent with the prices to the last Christmas.
Exactly this process has dripped trade badly: Apparently the department stores could not decide so surely which prize span they should apply with the single articles, because the consequences of the price increase on the consumer behaviour were unpredictable.
(If the trader plans the orbiting speed of a product badly, he can fall around essential profits in the prize span which is directed after the traffic intensity.)
Mehwertsteuer-bedingt the price increase of the "Napi" of goods basket last year was so radical that the most expensive basket crossed the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint, while the difference between prices amounted only to 844 Forint with the cheapest basket.
Of this year such extremes were not observed, because the most expensive basket cost about 1,630.00 Forint more than in the year before, and even with the cheapest one there was a rise in prices of 1,284.00 Forint.
In the comparison of both last Christmas seasons a catastrophic price increase appeared, the price of the everyday consumption articles in the hypermarkets has risen in less than 20 months by more than 30 percent.
(This confirms not necessarily the data of the central statistical office of Hungary again: With some basic food the statistical office in the period of 12 months ascertained a more than 30-percent price increase.
So in possibly beside flour also with eggs.)
If one throws, nevertheless, a look in the "Napi" to goods basket, this seems impossible with latter nearly, because the prize level of the product already expensive in the year before has risen even in the worst case about barely more than 10 percent.
Obviously flour suppliers are in a stronger position than the Eilieferanten - at least, could shift them the drastic price increase on the multinationals.
In the golden commercial triangle the hypermarkets do not complain; It is reported constantly from good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers does not look in three department stores at all at the prices.
It are bought from all large amount, long-lasting food goes to palettes above the counters.
There was Wednesday vormittag in all three department stores endless queues with the Kassa when suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
Indeed, a lower customer frequency is reported about the land, so that many multinationals complain with the pollsters, they could not even reach the planned turnover, namely not only with food, but also with lasting consumer goods.
In many places it is saved in disinfectants
This year more than thousand infections were registered in the hospitals which were to be led back on an improper contact with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the Überbelegung of the beds, the overloading of the staff - all factors which are not quite good for damming the infections, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center.
In many places it is also saved with the disinfectants.
In the Traumatologie department of the János of hospital a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The bacterium resistant to antibiotics was found in a male patient who was delivered after a heavy accident to the hospital.
The patient was isolated.
Here at the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
The injured person of a heavy car accident was dismissed from the hospital, however, after a little while the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation could not since then because of the bacterium which is still in the body of the patient yet.
Until of this year 10th December 1094 infections released by multiresistant causes were announced from hospitals to the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, according to the leading doctor of the national epidemiology center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, by multiresistant causes released infections were registered in the hospitals with certainty, however, the dark figure might be high.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) became from the MRSA, the Staphylococcus resistant to Methicillin-Oxacillin aureus released.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SATURDAY) bacterium carries possibly one third of the people in her nose, without it would cause an illness.
SA conditioned infections (as for example pharyngitis, tonsillitis, inflammations of the skin or wounds) react mostly well to antibiotics, they are well remediable.
If the means are measured, however, too high or are applied improperly, the resistant to antibiotics who spread out under suitable conditions in the hospitals fast originate from the well respondierenden bacteria.
In particular with patients with weak, or permanently badly functioning immune system, but also in older, or patients with low body weight these bacteria can cause heavy infections, as for example sore infection or blood poisoning, thus sepsis.
To the medical leader of the János of hospital according to the MRSA infection is nothing special, such incidents belong to the ill house everyday life.
One may mistake the infection not for the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is not where it is not searched.
Resistant against antibiotics
" Such patients are isolated, the nursing staff carries elastic gloves and masks on the care, and we dispose of the antibiotics necessary for the treatment " - thus Tibor Nyulasi.
Indeed, with her admission in the hospital the patients are examined for MRSA, an infection can be still not always avoided.
Test withdrawals too seldom
The majority of the infections released by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, indeed, the conditions ruling nowadays and circumstances are unfavorably for the containment of the origin or the propagation of the multiresistant cause, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection seems mainly in hospitals and old people's homes, the hospitals should examine the delivered patients and isolate immediately MRSA infected.
Nevertheless, in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological test withdrawal is not carried out so often.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation vonseiten of the state health insurance scheme.
Hence, most cases would come only in the daylight when the patient already has a sensible MRSA infection, according to the medical leader of the epidemiology center.
There is Vonseiten of the European Union strict recommendations to the suitable application of antibiotics in the human medicine, however, there are also in Hungary guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and clinical pictures.
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful, that is microbiological investigations are necessary, so that no resistance to the means can form, indeed, this directive is also not always kept by hospitals.
Under the ambulant, or itself in the basic care located patients microbiological test withdrawals are even even rarer, according to Karolina Böröcz.
It is saved with the disinfectants
Scientific proofs prove that MRSA of a patient on other will transfer most often from the nursing staff.
Just, therefore, comes to the hand washing, or carrying of gloves and masks a big meaning to, indeed, there are also in this area considerable defects in the hospitals.
MRSA will transfer by droplet infection or contact, however, in the home hospitals not always exists the possibility to isolate the infected patient.
The rooms are even often overcrowded, the beds briefly are lined up, although there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them from epidemiological view.
As Karolina Böröcz further marks, unfortunately, it even happens in the financially less well put hospitals that is saved with disinfectants, there are few orderlies, many patients - all factors which almost favor the origin of infections.
Such infections are far less frequent there as can be proved, or the other spreading of the cause can be detained where these preventive measures are kept, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
To gain control of MRSA infections causes to the health insurances huge costs, everywhere, hence, they are fought.
In England the prevention of MRSA, or her containment in the government program became, for example, held on.
After the first signs the program is successful - as published data cover, the trend of the MRSA infections is falling in England.
The European center for illness prevention (ECDC) has the prevention of the origin of multiresistant causes (under it also MRSA), as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals to one of his priorities explained.

Now in case of from the police chief of the XXII-th district of caused car accident with deadly exit the official certificate is.
The meanwhile withdrawn police chief of the XXII-th district who has killed a pedestrian on Tuesday with a car accident was neither alcoholized, nor under drug influence, Attila Morvai, the press agent of the Budapester upper public prosecutor's office said on Friday, after the official certificate was presented to the case.

According to police reports the driver suffered a shock, put back afterwards his functions and requested of retirement.
The Budapester public prosecutor's office has initiated her inquiries to the incident.

Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian property market is splendid - completely Europe looks carefully at the earlier seldom mentioned Balkan state.
What where, and who shops in the still cheapest market of the EU which becomes more expensive, however, rapidly?
An analysis the Bulgarian Re / Max division.
Bulgaria is nowadays undoubtedly the most popular plaster for real estate purchases in the East European space, with favorable ski apartments and houses by the sea.
Between the mountains the regions Bansko count, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa to him most popular, by the sea are Albena, the "Gold Coast", the "solar coast", and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar the racers, are asked, indeed, real estates all around Kavarna and Balcik also more and more.
According to appraisals of Re / Max analysts in Bulgaria wid also the inland sooner or later investors attract, thus, for example, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and also the really favorable area of soot registers more buyers.
The capital Sofia offers likewise tempting offers - commercial surfaces and office surfaces offer the highest yields.
Bulgaria is to be become on the best way one of the most attractive European golfer's paradise and to attract tourists therefore beside the summer season and wintertime also in both other seasons.
Hence, farsighted investors already make purchases now in the big style, for example, all around Bansko.
According to analyst the people who acquire real estates in Bulgaria also aim at a change of her conduct.
Most buyers are Englishmen, however, there come also prospective customers from France, Belgium, Spain, and more and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are likewise present, while there are mainly Russian buyers with the Black Sea and in the skiing areas.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgij Jankov, regional manager of Re / Max Bulgaria.
Those which want to sit down buy either revitalized real estates about 50-100.000 euros, or dilapidated houses about 5-15.000 euros which they renovate then themselves.
Good binding and accessibility as well as communication possibilities are capitalized, but also the nearness to a city, shops and doctors are vital for the buyers.
Those belong to the second category which are in search of a holidays domicile (Bulgaria holiday sighting of the Germans was listed in December under the top Ten).
The businessmen who invest with the purpose of a medium-term to long-term value increase put out the third group.
Real estates in the capital become more expensive meanwhile constantly, conditioned by the always waxing inquiry.
Indeed, within the EU the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, however, during the past five years there was a prize increase about yearly 21 percent.
The price increase with the real estate prices exceeds by far the increase of the salaries.
Fodor and six Hungarian percent
As minister of the environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert's meetings come to an end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 is continued by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 lands consult on the timetable of Bali in which the issue-reducing measures are fixed for the time after 2012, thus at the end of the Kyoto protocol.
Nowadays a violent debate is between industrial lands and developing countries going.
The USA have already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete figures, indeed, they be would ready to reduce the greenhouse gas issues in comparison to 1990 about 25-40 percent till 2020.
The other big question of the conference is whether the industrial states are ready to support the developing countries financially, as well as beside the reduction of the issues technological.
An agreement about the support was also achieved by developing countries.
The adaptation fund subordinated to the Kyoto protocol should be administered by a 16-headed council, probably with the global Umweltfazilität (GEF) of UN, how in the " Piac és profit " is to be read up.
Six percent of Hungary
Minister of the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the attempt of the EU to maintain her forerunner role with global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement till 2009.
The minister explained, the EU will reduce the greenhouse gas issues about 20% till 2020 (measured in the values of 1990), no matter whether the " agreement is achieved after 2012 " successfully, or not. The union be would even ready to exert itself for a 30-percent reduction, soferne other big industrial states of the world, or developing countries are likewise ready to follow to her obligations after forces and responsibly.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the objective of the states which had joined in 1997 to the Kyoto protocol was a reduction of only 5.2 percent, while the EU with her 15 member states at that time had already committed itself to a deficit of 8%.
The default for Hungary is reduction of the greenhouse gas issues about 6% in comparison to 1985-87 - a default which will fulfil the land absolutely as in the press release of the ministry of the environment is to be read up.
The application is high on Bali - at least, the long-term international climate-political agreement must be ready within two years, otherwise it would come into force with certainty only after 2012. In this case no renewed, international issue reduction system would follow the reduction plans agreed in the Kyoto protocol whose meaning has also emphasized the IPCC, the international scientific climate change-committee excellent with the peace Nobel prize of UN in his latest report.
The issue reduction would be thereby delayed, and the rise of the average temperature of the earth around more than 2°C would be inevitable what would entail extremely serious and irreparable consequences according to scientists.
British army advertises on YouTube
unities of the British army have published admissions about operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan for the purpose of popularity increase on the videomain entrance.
At first the British air force (RAF) YouTube has discovered for itself: In Afghanistan stationed special unities load since March, 2006 videos about operations controlled against the Taliban in the net, reports the BBC.
The admissions rotated with miniature cameras fastened on helmets are controlled in the air force base in Kandahar and afterwards are sent to London where they are put on the Internet.
Political message inevitably
Soldiers of the air force have already contributed 139 such admissions, her "canal" was looked more than 75,000 times.
The British ministry of defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring, 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British foreign ministry (Commonwealth office) and the international peacekeeping forces stationed in Iraq (MNFI) dispose of own YouTube canals.
Application in Afghanistan
Originally the air force has the videos with the purpose to recruit soldiers published, and how the ministry of defense says, the contributions also serve the purpose to inform the population about the real purposes of the foreign assignments.
Of such kind of published propaganda is nearly free in comparison to customary television advertisements, thus these videos carry, indeed, defensive expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC always a certain measure in political message in themselves, because they confirm the existence authorization of the military measures agreed by the government in own way.
Americans advertise with play
However, the army must also fight against amateur's admissions which create it beside the carefully worked on, zensurierten admissions likewise in the net - as for example those which show the death of the soldiers: In to some deceitful, "official" propaganda films it is at most spoken about the losses, nevertheless, the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
Numerous videos in use rotated in the application on the platform were loaded, by the way, already by the theatres of war in Iraq and in Afghanistan, the Britons have discovered this "type", however, only a short time ago for themselves.
The Americans advertise meanwhile in the a little bit other kind, namely with the free of charge downloadable shooting play "America's Army" in which the player can slip within the scope of a simulation more or less loyal to life in the skin of the soldier.
Christmas celebration with raffle and Pogatsche in the ministries
Employment minister Mónika Lamperth is squeamish by no means: Instead of a Christmas celebration she organizes a working conference with which her employees 2007 with coffee and Pogatsche can allow to end.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure Christmas mood with raffle or pushing in the official's hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and refreshment bar - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already grasped also the offices.
The biggest Christmas celebration of a ministry is held this year in the defensive department, indeed, the employees of the ministry are not expected in addition.
At the " Christmas celebration of the orphans " children are presented by liked soldiers, at the "mission celebration" members of the family are entertained by soldiers stationed abroad nowadays, however, there is also a receipt for the press.
The department makes available about 25 Mil. for the festivities.
In comparison to other departments kick over the traces the national agency for development (NFÜ) and the ministry of economy and traffic.
The 4.32 Mil. Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the economics ministry is held in the house of the future, about 350 600 employees are expected.
Indeed, the main focus of the festivities lies on Christmas, however, there will also be Live-Acts and a raffle raffle.
The national agency for development (NFÜ) has held her 4.7 Mil. Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the house of the land Counsellor of Justice (OIT), with concerts and festival food.
The hall rent amounted to 1 Mil. Forint, the rest was given on more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information a department of the NFÜ is also invited at another Christmas celebration, from the Hungarian economic development center (Zrt) from EU money MAY is organized.
For the celebration the building of the comedy theater ("Vígszínház") was rented.
It may have reached Zrt has not confirmed this information, because we the responsible not.
For what the suit?
The OIT building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the ministry of judicial system and police being which has held on the 7th December the Lucia ball instead of a Christmas celebration there.
They had to pay for the use of the rooms no rent to the OIT.
About 500 visitors came to the ball.
The festivities with an address of the minister were opened, after the dinner there was live music to dance.
On inquiry from [origo] one informed: There ruled in the ball no ball dress or suit duty.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government prepare in each case for puritanical celebration.
The health ministry organizes the celebration for the employees in own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Employment minister Mónika Lamperth does not load her employees officially at all to a Christmas celebration, but to the conference to the annual conclusion.
One counts on about 180 guests who are entertained - according to the press department - only with coffee and Pogatsche, the celebration with 350,000 Forint goes out.
Self-government minister Gordon Bajnai will stumble with his colleagues just in the assembly hall of the ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in own hall to which 436 employees are expected.
The issues were calculated with 2,500 Forint per head - around this money there is a refreshment bar receipt with next stumbling.
Since beginning of the term of office of János Veres the employees of the PM every year celebrate in this manner.
However, no right party mood will arise - not only because of the official speech of the minister but also because the celebration for the afternoon was attached.
The ministry of agriculture loads in 20. This time Jänner to a New Year receipt, the Christmas celebration of the ministry precipitates.
One asks 100 guests in the castle Vajdahunyad in the town park ("Városliget"); according to information of the department the issues with 1,000 Forint per guest are calculated.
As the press department announces, it becomes a very easy standing receipt to which only in Hungary accredited foreign diplomats are loaded.
The receipts which are organized every year begin traditionally with a short address of the minister and end with reserved feasting.
As the enstprechenden press offices on [origo] inquiry announce, there will be neither with Outside nor with the ministry of education a Christmas celebration.
Asked after the costs of the Christmas celebration one could give with the press department of the ministry of the environment no information.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to the celebration which is organized in the art industrial museum.

At the same time there will be in many places highway barriers of a direction.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations are followed the call to the strike - the list of the participants is updated on the league website constantly.

Political Capital: Hungarian guard raises state risk
In the opinion of the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) from Political Capital the activities in this August with support of the " movement for better Hungary have raised " founded Hungarian guard the risk of Hungary and the region in several regard.
Among the rest, in the "risk warning-report" of the institute one says: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian guard the highest political risk shows the " increase of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Gipsy and not-Gipsy's population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnic discussions ".
Principal reason for it is the strategy of the Hungarian guard which is presumably aimed at the provocation of such a discussion, according to the research institute.
As reported, this is looked as an omission by sides of the politically persons responsible: " Persons of the public life have the discussion Roma-Frage Vertretern more radically of political groupings leave which have built up now her political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast ".
One supposes that aggravate this the problem, the reasonable dialog make impossible, extremities favor above others, as well as would raise the likelyhood of violent discussions.
In addition, the Forschungsinsitut means which would have activities of the Hungarian guard, not least thanks to the huge attention of sides of the home and foreign media, " the picture of Hungary abroad considerably injured, in particular what the trust concerns in the stability and democratic maturity ".
We remember: Since autumn, 2006 the reorganization of radical and extremely right groups is in Hungary continuously in the impetus, so that since summer, 2007 several, " national self-defense association " calling organizations were founded themselves.
" To these groupings is common that they define themselves in each case as a civil organization, while they boast openly of it, her members on - every now and then armed - to prepare defensive tasks (emergency services, national defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the unsuitability of the police, the army, or the state even ", called it.
And further: All that happens according to that method which tries to camouflage different, on the policy and party sullenness of the population based, political attempts as a middle-class initiative.
The stress of the civil character and the association form do not serve only the avoidance of juridical hurdles which could appear in the course of the registration at court - it is at the same time a political strategy.
How of the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian guard show a risikoerhöhenden factor also for the relations with the neighbouring states.
" During the last months the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbouring states as a potential danger spring, quite a lot of of the ultranationalistic politicians of certain neighboring countries sees in the origin of the Hungarian guard the confirmation of his own Anti Hungary policy.
All that has consequences on the political stability of the region " - one said.
From the point of the research institute the foundation of the Hungarian guard is no single phenomenon in central east Europe, therefore the political risk has grown for the whole region.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard are comparable with those of the Bulgarian national guard whose foundation was announced in August, 2007 by the radically right-wing Bulgarian national union (BNU).
In the background of the origin of the Bulgarian guard there stood the Roma-mass excesses which have taken place in a town quarter of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU has taken the incidents immediately to the occasion for the foundation of the national guard, with the argument that the purpose of the organization is the " national protection ".
In her opinion a regular "Gipsy's terror" was perceptible since during the past 17 years in Bulgaria, nevertheless, the state remained idle and indifferent - thus Political Capital.
And further: The initiative would have kicked off a violent debate in the Bulgarian general public.
As said, the raised risk for ethnic discussions is also proved by the fact that have announced some Bulgarian Roma-Organisationen to found her own guard for opposition purposes.
Because the activities of the Hungarian guard up to now many resemblances to those point to the Bulgarian national guard, it is not to be excluded that Hungarian Roma likewise, with organizing her own protection react to the menaces, one says in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research manager with Political Capital said on inquiry of the press agency: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Yearly risk analysis reports would be published, and should be recognizable to risk-changing trends, the public opinion is informed, how in the case by the publication of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere holidays
In Hungary holidays are exactly regulated legally, so that the practise of the Umdisponierens of the working days has set up all around the holidays meanwhile, indeed, the next year gives to us less such days.
Also in the EU and in America one understands something else by "holiday".
The Hungarian judicial system makes a distinction between national holidays and work-free days.
Work-free days are mostly ecclesiastical holidays, or stand with significant historical events in connection.
We celebrate, for example, also New Year: The last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are work-free days - latter only already with it itself the New Year's Eve-celebrating can rest.
In the whole year we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The national holidays are a 15th March which reminds of the revolution of 1848, and 23rd October, the anniversary of the revolution of 1956.
20th August the state foundation, on the 1st May the work famedly, will think on the 1st and 2nd November we of our dead people.
In addition, there is two holidays to Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas.
Because our state, national days or religious holidays seldom fall on a week-end, the practise of the "working day-movement" plans itself in the cases proves itself in which we would work or after the holiday only one day.
However, the price of the extended week-ends is that we work on Saturdays before it very well, or must go to the school.
When this day which falls before or after the holiday at last should be processed, for long it is fixed by the employment minister in own order.
The statutory regulation counts to all employers and employees, for public employees and official of the civil service equally.
Only companies and equipment in which the company is continued without interruption, thus also in the holidays are excluded.
This year the working rules are mixed up only by the holidays in the end of the year a little bit: In this country from the 24th December the life stops formally, because most for the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve time balance, or the vacation specially lifted for it take.
Next year more holidays fall in the weekly middle, or on the end of the week, so that there will be less Umdisponierungen, than this year during the working days.
The calendar is put first all around the day of the work " on the head ", so that the people immediately four days in the piece can stay at home.
Saturday, 26th April becomes a working day, so that Friday, 2nd May a rest day can be.
The second Umdisponierung hangs together with the holiday on the 23rd October: On Saturday, 18th October one will have to process him Friday, 24th October to begin with.
However, at the end of the year will stand completely in the sign of the holidays, after from the 24th December everything lie and stops, even if New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six deterrent little things to annoy colleagues
E-mails, to send off we forgotten, linguistic news which we never receive - harmless lies which do not strike us at all: They bring "color" in the everyday life in the workplace.
The question is bare whether one gets used to this small inconvenience, or one better positions himself to the challenge and tries these ambiguous, for other irritating situations consciously to vermweiden.
Tips.
" Sorry, I have forgotten to aim to you that somebody has called of the marketing department " - a colleague says.
The fact that one has thereby missed a meeting?
At best one regrets it and tries to make up for it, while one maybe calls with the marketing department and confesses remorseful, one would have forgotten to straighten the news (this is the less usual method).
The thing with an excuse is mostly dismissed.
Before one gets entangled in embarrassing excuses, one should consider with which one can prepare really disagreeable moments for his colleagues and try to avoid these situations consciously.
A little bit lent what belongs to itself?
There is barely something more irritating, as if one reaches for a document, office accessories, or the phone, however, it is not there.
Yesterday the stapler still lay on the desk - today early it is away?
Or is he discovered lost believed ballpoint pens possibly on the desk of a colleague?
Without one should ask himself nothing of the colleagues lend, because they are annoyed rightly if they find out that something has got away.
Thus, no envelope or Post-its from the office in the pocket are, because it could meet one itself: nothing more there if one needs it, nevertheless, urgently.
Getratsche about the private life of the colleagues?
There are no effective means to detain a gossip which was already put in the world.
Who with whom, what done?
Where and which is why?
One should bind the information (or supposition) about the private life of the colleagues as far as possible not to everybody to the nose!
And if, nevertheless, somebody opens and betrays to us his most internal secret, we should not abuse this trust!
Best of all one is quiet like a grave instead of straightening the just not person present, even if other about the problems of the colleague also know.
Without reason ill announced?
If one calls in the office to announce himself with reference to tantalizing headaches ill because one feels just unwell, or just would like to rest, one should be about one in the clear: Now own work, unpushable open executions, projects with steady appointments must do the colleagues instead of itself.
Colleagues join in not horribly!
If the day before one knows already that one will not create it the next day in the office, or that something could interfere, why one must stay at home, one should announce it on time, so that neither the colleagues, nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Gesumme, giggling, phoning
One is deepened just in his work, it is disturbed, however, suddenly by the loud giggling of the colleagues?
Unintentionally a telephone call listened which one should not better have heard?
One should irritate the colleagues not with sums, singing, loud conversations (which one leads over her heads away), trampling, to durable cursing or grumbling.
All that can be very annoying, even if they write not exactly in a task (, plan, organize) are deepened.
Are the others to blame always?
If a project is not ready in time, one has forgotten an important letter or important directing to send off, one should not search the guilt of own forgetfulness with others!
As far as possible one should not unburden himself on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
Best of all one admits his mistakes to himself, and apologizes, if other were also concerned by it!
The question, as one make up for the mistake, or the missed can make up, is only much too right!
In the office - a feeling like at home?
Tracksuit bottoms and Schlapfen: However, comfortably for at home, nothing has lost in the office!
Then one should not even dress so casually if it the workplace admitted, actually!
Only do not become too sloppy - one should his colleagues, as well as respect himself so far that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably, also nicely and elegantly!
It to all want to prepare - or how one becomes dull for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of taking place every morning traffic jam.
From the radio there sounds a strange melody: The sound of a violin, combined with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The tempo changes, to the present sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar which sounds on mr2.
The home music scene has spoiled us for a long time not exactly with qualitative Electropop.
But now one sees even the traffic jam different if one hears, besides, the new album from Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, quite a lot of new and thrilling production from the home digital Underground scene slowly contribute to a change of the general view, and even if the garage rock with his Gitarrengequitsche is again "in" which proves home Electropop: There is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer has started in Pécs, made music even in the volume Yonderboi, before he started to walk - maybe because a pub stands no two pipers - his own way.
He created the breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music which melts elements from jazz, Electronic, and pop, however, only when one with the request to compose the soundtrack to a film, had moved up to him (e.g.
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török).
The formation which had appeared in the beginning in smaller clubs only became known to the broader audience than the magazine "wan2" lined up her first album from the year 2002 under the top to 50 home albums and chose Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the nearly only trendsetter also capable of market in the west.
Undoubtedly Zagar and his tape were "trendy", however, it interested nobody whether they carry this brand also with pleasure.
The tape has reacted as it should go: With a new, still better album.
The new album appeared now with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new ways for them, indeed, the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression is descended since from the time when Balázs Zságer was on the move still with another volume.
The aerial, flying allusion would be also in order, indeed, they strike beside the ethereal character of the music - to the spirit of the times and the trends suitable - pure guitar, the influence of the rock'n'roll.
With these songs " The of jigsaw puzzle " working singer György Ligeti with the première has fancied in England living and with the volume in the Millenáris.
A song of the album has created it even to the radiohit - since newest from morning till night pop music sending mr2 Petőfi has put the earwig to the listeners with the number "Wings of Love" which was taken up in collaboration with six home singers (" Underground of divas ") successive.
Everything in order.
Hvg.hu has asked with Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit throws up the question: To what extent is your music of a certain layer left?
Balázs Zságer: The concept "Layer music" signifies to me not exactly a lot.
In my opinion there are two castes in the pop music, namely not mainstream and Underground, or Alternatively and pop, but Commercially and honestly.
Even the so-called Alternatively or Underground music can be shallow and be inexpressive, however, just they can be even produced for the sales which play musik they too more commercially.
Also a good pop number can originate from an honest motive.
The admission readiness of the listener also functions after this principle, from languages and land borders independently.
hvg.hu: Are you up a difference in the openness of the Hungarian one and the foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs .: Abroad, in particular to the west of us the pop music has a bigger tradition.
There go not only teenagers or Twens on concerts, but also the older audience.
They pursue the trends in the pop music which happen round them, much more carefully because they hold them also for a part of the contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: Which role comes to the audience to at your work?
Is it important, who, where how many hear your music?
B. Zs .: Of course it is a good feeling to see that come more and more to our concerts.
However, we have never composed for the market.
With us the music not originates to serve a purpose, but for certain reason.
The role of the audience is mostly perceptible with the concerts where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is that again only in the unhandy changes of the moment.
Still has struck me one: If you want to make it to all right, you are no more interesting.
hvg.hu: How far would like you to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is on the move as a soloist and has built up his career rather in the west.
B. Zs .: We do not go really his way, sometimes of it completely seen that one tries over and over again, this in our music hineinzuinterpretieren.
We see ourselves rather than a team player which allow to trust in the musical presence of the other and develop them.
In the beginning comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were unavoidable of course, because several of us from his tapes come and have smashed another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts from mr2 Petőfi "Wings of Love" stands, firstly.
Many have heard only in connection with this number the name Zagar.
Was the opening with a little more popular style produced in the direction of a broader audience consciously?
B. Zs .: We had no plans to write a hit which should hold out then as a draft horse for the album.
In this song it goes around more.
It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the a little more difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How have you selected six singers?
Why just they what was the leading principle?
B. Zs .: The basic idea was to do a gospel song-like choir.
Then there came the idea to put together the choir from gifted soloists of the home music scene.
Thus the 6-headed choir has originated - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik ő Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we have christened then apäter " Underground of divas ".
hvg.hu: Wanted you to have the song just, or have the girls coformed it?
B. Zs .: There was the number long since in the instrumental version, but when the material was ready for the album, we imagined that this number still needs " something ".
The chord sequence has asked formally for a song voice.
I have the melody still at the same night eingesungen, later they have learned the girls.
Everything came practically right away and alarmingly spontaneously.
I can remember, at that time I was quite electrified, but it has required already also of the "divas".
With my voice the song would never only have become so strong.
hvg.hu: However, on the record, as well as with the concert one had the impression, the girls would be in the background.
There is no solo part (apart from short Solo from Judy Jay), they have no own role, sing completely together and are not louder than the music, is accompanied thus her song by the music not only.
Also on the stage they stood behind.
Is it an intention?
B.Zs .: The fact that they have stood behind, was because of purely technical problems in such a way.
Indeed, we wanted to let them consciously no solo roles come up.
In the number it is also about the fact that one should forget his ego a little, forget who is on the move where from come and where, we simply allow that to us these certain wings, the wings of the love raise.
I would have with pleasure that also other feel this euphoric state which we have felt when the song has originated.
hvg.hu: Which was the costliest song?
B. Zs .: At the musical creating work, actually, none, it has given rather with the mix more difficult tasks.
For example, with the " Dorian Gray''s dilemma " in which I play on a concert piano, or with " rock'n'roll of Goes To The Girls " where the grooving did not want to function longer, however, bit by bit everything has fitted together, how with a jigsaw puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs .: This changes with the concerts constantly and also now where I have the album "losgelasssen".
Nowadays these are "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number " Never The of seed ".
Deceitful broker risked billions because of feeling of inferiority
Bottomless swindler
Thus French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komerční banka calls his former employee Jerome Kerviel.
She came since because of him about nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a big player who wanted to touch it his colleagues, in addition, certainly was not incapable.
To the difference to all big bank houses he recognized on time the crisis by the amerikanischenn mortgage market.
" He is psychically rather weak, " was to be heard from the mouth of his superiors who indicated him at the police.
How, however, it arises from the statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example, the newspaper Le moons, he was a person, the end of the last year with his shops profits at the rate of 1.6 billion euros had achieved.
Crisis not only in America
" Everything what I wanted was to be earned for my bank money, " he states in his statement.
In summer he had succeeded in earning half a billion euros just on the American crisis.
In addition he had spotted of the opportunity since already in the beginning of the year.
In February there was the quite first news about the fact that so-called Sub Prime mortgages, like they had income-weak customer or such, the before redemption problems, would be given, get in difficulties.
However, influence on the whole economy should not have this crisis.
Kerviel did not believe this and kept right.
In the end of the year he had raised his profit up to 1.6 billion euros.
" Already as me the first half a billion had earned, I did not know how I should explain this, " admits Kerviel and repeats that he has kept definitively nothing for himself.
During the whole questioning he admits that he has faked documents, so that one would not come to him on the tricks.
He succeeded even in leading his bosses behind the light, even if bit by bit the Eurex stock exchange been interested in his shops.
Risk profit
Did he fear to fly up?
Probably barely.
" I thought that she satisfies the simple fact that I have earned 1.6 billions for the bank. "
Where from he took the courage to risk so much?
He had to work his position gradually.
He entered into the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after he had finished his study at the university of Lyons.
His annual salary amounted to about 51,000 dollars.
After two years he was already an assistant of a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still he knew that he will never earn so much like others.
" Already in my first conversation in 2005 I knew that one observed me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development, " explained Kerviel the inquisitor.
But soon after his entry there came the first big success.
With the stocks of the alliance he earned a lot, while he put half a billion euros on course losses of this title in the London bomb attacks.
And this was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you do profit, we leave you
" This is like a snowball, " he said the policeman.
But the bosses knew supposedly about all, or anticipated it.
" As long as I earned money, one closed the eyes. "
However, then the big blow came at the beginning of this year.
During one single day he lost a billion euros.
On a week-end at the middle of January he wanted to compensate this.
When he came on Monday to the work, he was already no more an employee of the bank.
And a few days later the bank announced that it has lost because of him five billion euros.
And how did they come to him on the tricks?
Suspicious he came along by a vacation.
" I have taken only four days of the year before.
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one looks to him in the maps, " said Kerviel finally.
Czechia has the chance to come to 365 billions
Yesterday Czech ministers and representatives of the European committee signed a total of nine developing programs by which Czech Republic can come during the next years to 14 billion euros (about 365 billion crowns).
It is here about about half of the sum which can receive Czechia from the year 2007 to 2013 generally from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
Czech companies will be able to get about 100 billion crowns from the program " enterprise and innovation " assigned.
Mostly money, about 150 billions, will flow into the traffic removal.
The traffic program is the biggest developing program and encloses up to 22 percent of the means which Czechia from the fund can receive.
This money raises accordingly the household of the state transport infrastructure fund which will dispose the next year of 90.8 billions.
The program " enterprise and innovation " should serve enterprisers and companies to win finances to innovative enterprises.
The companies should thereby win finances for the introduction of new technologies, for operations research, but also for the introduction of more actual organization methods.
With the present Geld-Aquisition from EU fund Czechia belongs under the new entry lands to up to now in the least successful one.
Nicaraguanisches court confirms 20-year-old prison sentence for ex-presidents
A court of appeal in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the 20-year-old prison sentence for the former president Arnold Alemán to which he had been condemned in 2003 because of finance deception at the rate of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he had been dismissed from the prison and lived under house arrest on his hacienda with the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 comes till 2002) of this Medium American state again behind grid, is unclear according to news agency AP nowadays.
Now of the chairpersons of the court of appeal, Ileana Pérez, according to it will depend on the like officials whether one allows to sit out his punishment Alemán at home, or whether he must go in the prison.
A court proved four years ago that Alemán had shifted regularly money of the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictive and the accounts belonged in reality to his relatives and the narrowest followers.
Some of this money landed, in the end, in a fund which Alemán had furnished for the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yes, it is created.
The budget is approved.
What is in this household a special?
It is the first household which this government has sketched, and without support of the opposition was accepted by the coalition majority.
For the current year was still approved with support of the ČSSD (social democrats) because him minister Sobotka (from this party) had presented, and which could not allow itself ČSSD, therefore to reject him.
This time as opposed to lively debate before the vote about the motion of no confidence against the government nothing happened dramatic.
The chamber of deputies approved of this traditionally little notable, still extremely significant law in complete silence.
This is paradoxical as it were.
All governance begins and ends with the single chapters and posts of the household whether that likes or not.
The household is an essential component of the policy, however, is covered by the struggle for power of the government and the opposition.
This is a more thankful subject for the media, and, therefore, they dedicate to him more attention.
A quarrel among politicians is much more interesting for the general public than sober figures.
The budgets suffered at the past social-democratic governments from three weak points which the household can remove for 2008 not all at once:
The first one is the high interest of issues which oblige for law and it concerns not only the pensions, but also around the social expenses which the "silent" coalition from ČSSD and KSČM (communist) has decided last year before the choices.
The second one is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third restriction exists in the deficits of the public finances, i.e. to the budget deficits of the municipalities.
Nevertheless, the biggest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This household is public and eingermaßen under control.
However, a true time bomb is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors gave to open other springs for investments except income from taxes, deliveries and bank loans, often unthinkingly the debentures from by which they been to blame for her city halls in the excess.
During the last years they succeeded, these debts by plentiful sales of stocks of the energy nets and other supply networks which they had received in the train of the privatisation from the state to pay off.
Now this spring has already dried up.
As far as we keep only to official and checkable facts, we find out, that:
our economy already for some years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase runs through which boasts ČSSD without respite.
This showed a unique possibility for her governments to fix the public finances.
Instead, these governments been to blame for the state, nevertheless, even more.
Other lands, apart from a few exceptions like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have economized much more rationally than our republic.
This is a gigantic disgrace which is to be ascribed mainly to the earlier governments.
We belong to the lands which, seen in the global graduation, in least by poverty are threatened.
Therefore, no nassiven social programs which were inflated, unfortunately, just during the last years quite superfluous-wise in huge magnitude are necessary.
Even if it has succeeded, a part of the senseless populist issues which were dismissed this year before the choices to glide is clear that if it does not come in the next time for a movement of the pensions entry age and to a pension reform, then any policy ends practically in this land, and, no matter who is in power, nothing but will remain to him pure administering.
It is only easily exaggerated if one says that then from ruling politicians official become who split the biggest part of the inland revenue mechanically on pensions and social expenses.
Therefore, this year's household can be no revolution, but can order only to the displacement of normal issues by duty expenses stop.
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be absolutely superfluous if earlier governments had not been economical during the last ten years what only went.
If we do not want that it really arrives that from ruling politicians pure administrative official become, then we must be patient and wish this not too strong coalition government which is aware, however, of that that the state can be economical only so much, as he is able to take in taxes and fees, rest by the preparation of other reform laws.
Only these allow a gradual penetration of a well-balanced budget.

Banks want to master crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the central banks of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis at the finance markets.
Thus more than 100 billion dollars will reach by means of auctions the currency markets.
On these auctions the banks auction interest rates for which they are ready to borrow mutually money.
For example, sends the American Fed 40 billion dollars on auction, other 24 forks out them for the European and the Swiss central bank.
It is after the posters 11th September the first time, that the central banks of the single states on a so co-ordinated action to the defense or Abmilderung of the results of a financial crisis to some.
" This step should remove the biggest difficulties of the economy, thus the increasing lack of the freely available capital which the banks can lend " wrote in a report for his customer Bernard Baumohl about consultation company Economic Outlook Group.
" The co-ordinated action of the central banks has reduced the likelyhood of a recession in the USA of 65% on about 50%, " Baumohl added in his report.
The banks have lost because of not served loans already about 60 billion dollars, above all in the United States.
Analysts expect even other billion losses.
" " The central banks must really have had fear of what can still follow everything when decided on this action, " said the chief small farmer of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
" It looks in such a way that the position is really bad, " he repeated.
The central banks have the fear that if the banks themselves hard have access to loans, for her customers loans become also more expensive.
This would reduce the consumption and overthrow the American economy in a recession, possibly with consequences on the economic growth in the whole world.
The central banks have decided on it, after they had not succeeded, the so-called. To lower LIBOR, the London interbank interest rate which is used with the monetary rental company between banks.
This means that the banks were afraid constantly to borrow money mutually, and this although the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain during the autumn her interest rates several times had lowered.
" This will have the same effect like an other sinking of the interest rates, " Greg Salvaggio of tense Consulting of the agency said Reuters.
Some analysts are of the view that this step of the central banks contributes to the Aufheizung of the crisis because he does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the property market in the USA.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unplausible
Global climate changes damage supposedly to developing countries mostly.
President Václav Klaus commented again to the problems of the global warming.
Now the criticism referred to the coming to an end international conference of UN to the climate change on Bali.
In Vienna where he presented his book " blue, no green planet " he explained that the debates of the ecologists are unplausible.
According to Klaus not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable which forms a strange mixture of government representatives and such of not-government organizations, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric which she accompanies, and the reality.
" The debate there is unstructured, these are word fireworks, the only substitute is for a real solution of present problems, " said Klaus.
The Czech president stressed by the image of his book that his subject is very important for him, and that he is involved in it, therefore, so.
He also expressed his contentment about the fact that his book appears in German translation because " I often hit on caricatures of my views. "
Now prospective customers could read up his setting undistorted.
Klaus reminded of the fact that it is no Klimatologe, but he has to his opinion after sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is, in the end, a graduate to understand capable, technical treatises and to judge, experience with statistics has and is also an economist.
He called the thesis main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that his changes are normal that there is no correspondent opinion among the scientists to the global warming that the results of the present changes are big not too and serious and showed therefore no menace, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate are is superfluous, luxurious ineffectively and unacceptably.
In addition, he holds it as somebody who has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen, for unacceptable to force upon other unproven views he considers as a dangerous restriction of the freedom.
On questions of persons present he explained repeatedly, he is not against a " reasonable environment protection, but against militant ecological activists who take no consideration on the relation between expenditure and yield. "
About the same subject Klaus had spoken in Vienna already two months ago in the Hayek institute.
600000 people did not succeed in exchanging her driving licence
600000 drivers missed the term to exchange her old driving licence whose validity at the end of the year runs off.
Today is the last day where one can apply for the exchange, so that the authorities get to issue a new driving licence up to the end of the year.
However, the ministry does not fear that after New Year hundred thousands drivers proceed without valid driving authorization on the streets.
According to the authorities primarily those have not exchanged her driving licence which do not want to go at all.
While small places strong dropping of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch announce, the offices of the capital are covered with applications, and the interest in the exchange still grew this week.
The city administration dispatches daily about 2000 customers.
One must be waiting about half an hour.
In Prague approx. 140000 drivers have not exchanged her driving licence yet.
The exhibit a new driving licence lasts 20 days.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibit with a shortened term of five days.
However, in this case the driver must 500 crowns dazuzahlen.
A fine threatens from January the drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange up to the end of the year and drive off without valid driving licence.
The malefactor pays maximum 2,000 crowns.
The police leaves it, however, by the violation also with an admonition bewenden.
In case of a violation the punishment on 2,500 crowns can rise.
According to earlier information that of the municipality can also get a punishment imposed which does not go at all.
To him can threaten it is said so, a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The ministry called on the offices already to let prevail mildness and to impose at most a punishment of 1,000 crowns.
However, to the speaker of the traffic ministry, Karel Hanzelka, according to threatens nobody a 1000 crowns punishment.
The driving licence is a document with which everybody can decide whether he wants to own it or not.
It does not concern an identity card which everybody, namely a valid, must have.
The people who want to go no more should deliver her driving licence.
It is enough to bring him to the responsible local authority or to send him by registered letter there.
In the end of the year the driving licences become invalid which were issued between 1964 and 1993.
However, the drivers must exchange bit by bit also other kinds of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 till 2000 have for the exchange another three-year time.
The validity of the driving licences which were issued in 2001 to 2004 ends in December, 2013.
Besides, according to Hanzelka it is about 2.6 millions other driving licences.
Court lowers punishments for detectives who were formed an alliance with Berdych
The former policeman Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík which are accused to have done common thing with the volumes of David Berdych received 13 or 10 years of custody.
This decided in a legal judgment the Prager higher regional court which reduced, besides, her punishment around one or about two years.
Originally 14 or 12 years threatened the detectives of the " office for the fight against the organized crime ".
Against the today's judgment there is no appeal possibility, only check at the uppermost court is possible.
Indeed, Berdych itself is also accused in this thing, however, the erstinstanzliche judgment approaches to him at first.
Nevertheless, with other processes he had already received punishments from a total of 16 years.
To any more he cannot be condemned.
A municipal court spoke in January, 19 persons above all because of participation in raids guilty, today the higher regional court negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most culprits denied from the outset the accusation with the grounds, it concerns a contrived case.
According to the mittelböhmischen municipal court members of the police in arrangement, among the rest, with Berdych to criminals handed over information from springs of the police, covered different raids and helped members of the volumes to avoid the criminal proceedings.
Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the prey left the volumes for it.
With the accusation it is about criminal offenses of the volumes from 1999 till 2001.
In particular around the raids whose victims often suffered heavy injuries, but also around usurpation and unauthorised weapon possession.
By house searches the police discovered since unlawful guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser sight telescope and a submachine gun.
The volumes has got rich according to the accusation by her raids about many million crowns.
Except beihnahe 20 men in this procedure to recognized courts Berdych and a row more different because of other raids legally than guilty.
Other men from Berdychs vicinity must justify themselves in another process, other cases have not reached yet before the court.
Of the main negotiations are up to now Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej which are in Irish custody and wait for the final decision on her delivery for the purpose of criminal proceedings in Czech Republic, escaped.
Children exchanges - calculation: 12 millions
For the exchange of children in a maternity clinic the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, from the hospital wants to ask in Třebí č 12 million crowns of compensation plus costs of an action.
For each of the mothers three millions, for the fathers two millions and for the children a million.
The hospital offers maximum 200000 for every parental pair.
Therefore, the legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, agrees with the suggestion Velebas not at all.
" We reject such a suggestion, he lies around a multiple too high, " said Dostál after the today's negotiations.
" To be able to form an opinion to this countersuggestion to us, however, we need the certificate which allowed to provide the opposition.
We will find out whether it generally has logical value.
However, we insist on the view that should lie for everything together in the Hunderttausenderbereich, " stressed Dostál.
The amount should move according to him between 100000 and 200,000 crowns for each of four parents.
At the beginning the family from Jabloňov for every month which it had not gathered her biological daughter wanted a million crowns.
For Veleba a certificate which had compiled the university hospital in Prague Motol for him served as a basis for compensation negotiations.
The parents of the children suffered in the opinion of experts from the area of Psychology and psychiatry psychic damages and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men stood the stress situation better, even if they were up against reproaches, they could have prevented the mistake of the newborn children.
The women manage again with the after-effects of the experienced trauma worse, as well as also with him what just runs off now Veleba summarized the contents.
Veronika and Nikola exchanged on the 9th December of the last year nurses of the maternity clinic in Třebí č.
The last week the children returned to her biological parents - Nikola to Čermáks in Přibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Bro ž and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district captain of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mährische height) handed over at the end of October of every family 100,000 crowns as a substitute with issues which had originated to them from the mistake of the hospital in Třebí č which is subordinate to the district.
All hospitals in Czechia are liability-insured for law.
In the case of doubt they must reach to a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply with the sluggish help.
The courts have awarded up to now affected persons relatively low compensation sums, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundred thousands, exceptionally from millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the quarrel around the brand " kingdom of Walachei ".
Indeed, of the judge in the municipal court in Ostrava according to he has used as more first the name " Walachischer of king ", but the project had built up in long-standing work a team around Tomáš Harabiš in cooperation with the actor.
Today Polívka did not take part in the negotiations.
However, according to his lawyer the thing is not probably finished with it and his mandator will probably insert appeal.
" The quarrel goes about the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär, " said after the negotiations Polívkas lawyer.
Everything fancied just this actor and comedian with the words " Walachisches of kingdom ".
Of the same opinion is also Harabiš.
" We have an almost ten-year-old work behind ourselves.
He said monetary procurement and drafts of the activities, ".
To him according to the occasion is a quarrel around money.
" After years has struck them that the project is successful and that they could also have a little bit of it.
They want to win parasitär in our work, " he repeated.
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka the name " Walachischer of king " for the first time in one of his telecasts.
In 1993 actor Radoslav Brzobohat ý crowned him.
At that time, however, this did not hang together with the intention to found a fictive kingdom.
Some years later there came Harabiš on the thought to spend walachische passports.
From an originally funny action there crystallized a business and an enterprise activity out to which Harabiš connected then the foundation of the company " Walachisches of kingdom ".
In 1997 Polívka of the use of his name and his signature agreed in the passports and offered to her owners even reductions in the visit of his farm and his stage performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
Today the judge also stated that Harabiš used only the bare idea which has publicized Polívka in the broadcasting "manege" for his enterprise intentions.
" The popularity Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the walachischen kingdom, " said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project Harabiš and his team are which would have intensely devoted themselves to him.
The collaboration of the parties fallen out today lasted up to 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there started to pile up between Polívka and Harabiš the disputes which culminated in the dismissal " king Boleslavs I. electively up to the Saint Nimmerleins day ".
Then the guide roller took up on suggestion Harabišs Jarmila Šuláková as a queen mother.
Then in 2002 Polívka submitted the complaint which rejected the court today against Harabiš and his company.
The competition prepared by Harabiš could bring clearness in the quarrel around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should arise from it.
He did not want to betray details and an appointment yet.
" We want to rush nothing.
It should be such a thing like the king's relocation in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Also Mr. Polívka can announce himself with it quietly, " Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Voruteile dwindle
To say the truth, I never was a special fan of Peugeot 206.
His handling characteristics were not a lot worth, one could call the quality of the way circuit, the steering system and also the processing rather subnormal.
However, now is his successor, Peugeot 207, at the market, and he is better around a lot.
The station-wagon with the name SW is other one more piece, and to me remains only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classical Hatchback of 207, I had to complain, for example, of the too low head room on the Hintersitzen.
There is this discomfort now no more, because the bodywork of the station-wagon is so formed that Zweimetermänner will not even suffer.
Quick further
I go through the interior equipment only briefly not to recur too much.
It concerns a rather successful design where I have objections only because of the miserable middle tunnel.
There I would greet a little bit more designerische creation where the car does, otherwise, such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past are the times where we complained, perhaps, to too short seats or headrests.
Also the side hold has substantially improved compared with 206.
What concerns the space offer, one can also feel here the enlarged dimensions of the bodywork.
In the station-wagon the already mentioned lack of head room is also removed.
Suitcase in the boot
However, the central issue in this car is the loading bay.
I must call him (also because of the openable back window) very well loadable and space-saving.
The hollow cavities are equipped with hold belts which show an ideal compromise.
They do not interfere, can be pulled apart and also hold on heavier objects.
However, we talk about the loading volume.
It amounts according to table in the basic equipment to 428 liters what is a rather average value in comparison to competition.
Indeed, not in comparison to vehicle bestselling in Czechia of this class, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find out that Peugeot stays behind about clearly perceptible 52 liters.
For a foreign vacation or with the invitation of a baby carriage this value is already critical.
But to emphasize around the Positiva, I must still mention on folding down the back seats quite level loading bay or also the very low loading edge.
120 HP in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four coil petrol engine with cubic capacity 1.6 liters and an achievement of 88 kW.
And honestly said, so a 1600Kubik engine should look which drives a Familien-Hatchback.
He is quiet, has a low consumption and moves well.
If I compare him to his counterpart in Škoda which sometimes works as if his exhaust with a cloth was blocked, then I can be only inspired by him.
The price-list speaks volumes
The price of this car is not quite popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400th petrol engine at the rate of 329,900 crowns still begins.
With our engine it costs from 410,900 crowns what is already quite a lot.
The equipment premium of the test car hits once again with 80,000 crowns in addition to beech.
However, we had head air bags, automatic air-conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electric window lifters behind and and...
Thus the car costs all together settles 531,900 crowns.
This is an amount, but you add up once the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will come with a quite similar sum.
Thus only the decision remains which brand one wants to choose.
Integration of Slovak pupils at britschen schools does not succeed
At British schools the number of children from lands of East Europe increases what causes in the local fears around the other development of the local school system.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans bumps up to now into a row of obstacles.
British schools find out even cases where disputes increase between the immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants in act of violence.
The case of North Kent illustrates the problem with the integration of children from East Europe at britschen schools appropriately where the discussions increase between the local and Slovak immigrants bit by bit.
Set-tos, chicaneries and fights among pupils have spread to the relations between the parents.
The situation has developed already so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The culprit defended herself with the fact that the boy has offended them with racist terms of abuse.
The police also had to intervene after an attack of two girls under age on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls had done towards the man supposedly racist remarks and had pelted him with stones.
" When we went home, a boy climbed on a bus small house and spitted on us.
When I said to him, he should stop, he pelted us with apples and pears and then bared his bottom, " a mother of Slovak pupils of the newspaper The Times described an other disagreeable incident.
Discomfort comes from both sides.
One of the locals called the quarrel with the immigrants from East Europe even survival fight.
The cited cases testify that the mood becomes more and more tense between local and immigrants at British schools.
In Great Britain 70000 Slovaks who came here on working search are announced.
Therefore, about 30000 Slovak pupils visit British schools.
Cuba - the nicest island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of the freedom.
What always you expect from your vacation, this will come true if you select only the right thing.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all Inclusive with the waiters who offer pizza, ice and beguiling cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you find in superabundant measure.
However, only on an island you still find even more, and this island is Cuba, biggest and nicest of the Greater Antilles.
At the moment the Spaniard was Cuba their bastion for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the nicest place which has seen a human eye.
Once Havana became a camp or transit camp of treasures which had robbed of the Spaniards in America and advanced then to Europe.
And then there came the American epoch.
Hotel Nacional completely originated at the end of the 20-th century.
One of the bosses of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano allowed to build it, because everything what counted in the USA as a crime (especially during the prohibition) was seen on Cuba with pleasure and was supported - drugs, game of chance, prostitution.
Among his guests were among other things
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana grew blocks of flats, over the wide boulevards the cars which counted to the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets went.
Ernest Hemingway bought to himself a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht lie.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del midmonth stars of the show business and politicians from completely America left her signatures.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havana you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at hotel Nacional one mixes for you cocktails completely by wish.
And the cult cars of the fifties travel around in Havana till this day because the Schigulis imported once and Fiat have broken up in the salty and humid air long time ago.
If Havana, in particular his oldest part, may strongly have come down, one nowhere finds in the vicinity so many miraculous colonial places of interest like exactly here.
Other places are just dressed up, for example, Trinidad.
In regard on the fact that the tourism brings urgently required money there was for this development green light.
During the last fifteen years new hotels have originated not only in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province Holguín and also on islet like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and other.
Cuba offers one more quirk which is unique in the world and draws above all railroad lover.
Steam-pursued and diesel-pursued small-time roads brought the sugarcane of remote plantations to the sugar factories.
Their vehicle park was not renewed for decades, and thus one sees there the comical and fully functioning railroad engines whose contemporaries stand somewhere else for a long time in the museum.
Destinations
The majority of the visitors of Cuba does not let out the bedeutendendsten places.
Thus one must write about Varadero or Havana no more in detail.
Remains only to mention that in the already mentioned property Hemingways a museum is whose visit to itself that which likes this author should not allow to escape.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
The luxuriant vegetation grows in lime ground.
The Mogotas, lime hill and lime rock, rise precipitously from the valley ground, in her hollow cavities fertile ground collected, are covered by the also weather-beaten cliff areas of thick growth.
It is this valley where the maybe best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In his final form you can hit on him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havana.
Possibly it seems to somebody also interesting that there the Chilean result of the TV serial "major Zeman" was turned.
Trinidad
An ancient town, briefly, after the Spaniards had settled in the island, was founded.
Fame and wealth brought her trade with slaves and sugar.
The wealth embodied itself in the smart beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influences from the later French colonists, has barely changed for 400 years.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountains situated, is such a backwater that there was there still in the fifties of the last century no street which would have connected the area with the remaining land.
This isolation contributed to the fact that there remained unnoticed.
Nothing was built there, but, therefore, was also torn off nothing, everybody was glad that he had a roof over the head.
If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon, it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the surroundings, as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the " valley of the sugar factories ".
Then in the evening one should go to the Casa de la Música which revives after the darkness, and where the music is not quiet up to the morning.
Baracoa
Some call this small town completely in the east of Cuba the nicest one of the island.
Absolutely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both streets which lead from Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run by a scenery which is barely touched by human interventions.
UNESCO took up this eastern outpost of Cuba thanks to the untouched nature there in her world heritage list.
There the best chocolate is produced, in the church one shows the cross of Columbus (in reality it has originated about hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and several mesas from which El Yunque is the best known one are to be seen by the hill where the former castle, current hotel El Castillo, stands.
About the coffee, the rum, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountains, the pork bay and the island Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctum of Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess about all this one could write many sides.
However how one says so: Better with own eyes consider.
Formed an alliance in Afghanistan are passive, state Americans.
Not enough soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment influences according to the United States the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should sketch according to the words of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not run according to her images, the representatives of the lands who have stationed unities in the south of the land agreed in Scottish Edinburgh about it.
Beside the growing opposition of sides of the Taliban eight participant states also discuss other coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States called the Nato unities for more activity by her Verteigungsminister Robert Gates, Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the Afghan government and in the intensification of the development aid.
" In Afghanistan a Vorwärtsentwicklung is perceptible, but military power can be only one part of the solution.
Another part consists in allowing to the inhabitants, in beginning even a development of the economy and security, " says the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents has reached the highest state for five years according to the American army.
The number of power actions has risen in comparison to year before by 27 percent, in the southern province Helmand even about sixty percent.
The Nato lands have stationed in Afghanistan about 40000 soldiers, of it possibly one quarter in the southern territory.
However, according to the United States the allies have bumped to an absolute border what concerns organization and equipment of the unities.
Specifically they demand other helicopters, soldiers and experts to the training of the Afghan unities.
" We will seriously have to think about the concrete purposes for the next time and about the way how we can reach them, " said gates.
Today similarly the secretary general of NATO, Jaap de Hoop commented.
" I am not delighted about what we have at disposal in Afghanistan to land and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment which we would need, and this is not enough, " De Hoop of the agency said Reuters for the end of 3-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Under the involved lands quarrel rules during the last months also about whether all allies give her best in Afghanistan.
Because of passiveness, for example, Germany was criticized.
" The Germans are represented in Afghanistan relatively numerously.
However, they are stationed in areas where there is only one minimum of power and the fight requirements are not so high for them as for us in the southern and eastern part of the land, " said gates.
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" called this week the German soldiers slackers.
" Unmasks Afghan idlers: The Germans do plays, while our boys fight, " wrote the "Sun" in a contribution which was complemented with photos of German soldiers who play table tennis.
The German picture newspaper went over to the counterattack and printed a picture of a British unity with a rugby competition in the southern part of Afghanistan.
National debts become in 2009 on a trillion to quick to high ones
A national debt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech.
The whole guilt rose till the end of September on 842.7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to get into debt this year with 159.2 billions Konen.
At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan, nevertheless, on 152.8 billions.
The national debts of Czech Republic rose till the end of September on 842.7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year they rose therefore by 40.2 billions.
However, since June they sank by 13.4 billions.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed with it his information about the national debts from beginning of October.
A guilt of 84,000 crowns is cancelled to every Czech.
About the whole last year the state got into debt around more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
" Till present it seems that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns possibly thanks to the lower deficit for the next year only in 2009.
The next year the debts should move between 900 billions and a trillion crowns, " said David Marek, analyst of the Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly it sees Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance: " To the excess of a trillion we could come in the course of 2009.
When exactly, depends on the next household which we do not know yet.
If should appear that the situation on the political stage changes, and the politicians should be ready more to save, could last up to 2010.
But from such a change I do not go out, " he noted.
Debts grow
The national debt is due to the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the budget.
The national debt is financed by treasure instructions, state debentures, direct loans or, for example, by loans of the European investment bank.
The home state indebtedness rose this year meanwhile on 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debts of the state rose meanwhile by 1.7 billion crowns on 123.3 billions.
The so-called national debt capable of market reached billions crowns at the end of September, 803.3 and sank since June by 13.7 billions.
The average maturity of the national debts rose for 6.5 years.
" The whole guilt rose about the year from first up to the third quarter by 13 percent what is really a lot in view of that how well it goes for the economy.
It is interesting that the taking is to be registered above all with the debentures where the increase amounts to 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts rise, but then this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, " commented Pikora the data.
Better than expects
From the financing strategy and the contact with the national debts for 2007 it arises that the government had planned for this year to take up 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December the ministry thanks to the better development of the state Hauhaltspolitik reduced the plan, nevertheless, on 152.8 billion crowns.
This amount is due above all to the state budget deficit which will reach obviously 76 billion crowns instead of the estimated 91.3 billions this year.
Further it concerns at most included in the plan means for the consolidation agency at the rate of 13.3 billion crowns, a 10 billions reserve to the payment of the pensions, the financing of state debentures for 43 billions and rates for the loans at the European investment bank at the rate of 1.8 billions.
Today for the fact that she has given a name to a teddy bear it was brought forward to a court in Khartum.
According to information of her lawyer the British teacher who had been accused in Sudan of insults of Islam was condemned on the Thursday evening by a court in Khartum by 15 days of custody and next expulsion.
The Briton was accused to have permitted 6 to seven-year-old pupils, to give the name Mahomet to a teddy bear, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is prohibited.
She would have earned to be whipped.
After parents of pupils had complained several times with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts, the 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active in the Unity High School of Khartum on Sunday was taken up with herself at home and was accused according to the article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code of the insults of Islam.
Really this affair takes her beginning in September when the teacher asks theirs 6 to seven-year-old pupil to select a name for the Klassenteddy.
Die children suggest eight names, under it Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed , reports headmaster Robert Boules.
In the end when the class votes, 20 of 23 children Mohammed choose as the dearest given name.
Absolutely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all also a given name very frequent in Sudan.
Afterwards the children have provided a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the picture signature Mein name is Mohammed .
The bear itself carried no sign with this name, but the problem is quite easy that the representation of the Islamic prophet is looked as insults of Islam.
One of the Moslem colleagues of Gillian Gibbons who informs at the same school in Sudan explained, he knows them well, and she would never have something would have acted with which she could step to a religious belief too near, ich regrets only that she has asked the children to be right for a name, on this occasion, , his opinion it concerns only a unschuldigen mistake .
An opinion which numerous pupils of the teacher divide who speaks this as sehr carefully towards her pupils  and as Person, never in the class about religion  describe.
One thinks that the given name Mohammed is at the same time also in Great Britain in the second most frequent given second name for which into English 14 different manners of writing exist.
This often from Moslem families well-chosen given name counts as a kind of deference to the prophet (he is often given to the first-born of a family).
But how are the rules concerning the use of this given name?
May one give him, for instance, to toys?
This is naturally a question of the interpretation.
On Wednesday it came with the last negotiations meeting in Vienna to no arrangement on the future status of the province.
At the end the miss
The Serbians and Albanians from Kosovo have finished Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, the sixth and last discussion meeting without being able to overcome her controversies about the future status of the separatistischen province.
Es it is unfortunate that the parties could come to no arrangement on the status , explained the European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger with a press conference in Vienna.
With stress on the fact that the peace is at stake in the region his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrad and Pristina asked to follow to her obligations to the preservation of the peace, and to continue the conversations also after the end of the negotiations.
Es are expected no acts of violence in immediate future, but we stand at the beginning of a very difficult time , he added and indicated that there are absolutely clear tensions.
End of the mediation on the 10th December
The mediators of the Troika which unites the European Union, the USA and Russia in itself will meet on Monday the last time in Serbia and in Kosovo.
The future to 90% of in Albanian speaking inhabited province could become clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit her report to the UN Security Council up to the 10th December.
The conversations of Baden, close to Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiations meeting since the Troika the last August of UN the order to a new mediation had received.
Americans and Europeans calculate on the fact that her mediation order will end on the 10th December.
The Russians who had already blocked the approval of the independence of Kosovo at the security council exist on a continuation of the negotiations after this final date.
Russland was and remains an advocate of a negotiated solution, a concerted solution , said Botsane-Khartchenko.
one-sided declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has stood during eight years under management of UN, the western lands hold the independence under supervision by the EU for the only solution with future.
Pristina is ready to announce unilaterally this if the security council should not decide in their favours.
Belgrade exists on stronger autonomy
Bedauerlicherweise it could be dripped no arrangement , the president announced to the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the hotel in Baden where since Monday these were led Verhandlungen of the last chance .
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the kosovarischen rebellion and future prime ministers of the province divided his regret.
Nevertheless, he added that the plan suggested by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of einer past which has led to murder and deportations .
Domino effect 
Serbian president Boris Tradic was on his part of the opinion that a compromise is to be aimed always, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo about the consequences of a one-sided declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade thinks, that it especially a "snowball effect" in a region fürchet which is still weakened so much by the independence wars of the 90s.
Für Serbia does not mean this that a compromise would be impossible , he said.
On Tuesday the Serbian delegation had insisted on the fact that any decision is dripped solely solely in the security council where of their Russian allies a veto power holds.
Das parliament of Kosovo will have the last word 
Nur a decision from the rows of the security council is for Serbia satisfactory , explained Serbian prime minister Vojislav Kostunica.

Spectacular repair in the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his companions of the occupying of the international space station (eat) more than seven hours will have used in the space to carry out the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector which is indispensable for the continuation of the scientific works on the station.
A risqué climbing out which has achieved on account of his duration, the distance of inhabitable modules, the quickness with which he was organized and to carry out which from the astronauts gebastelten  tools, in order the repair several records.
The problem appeared on Wednesday when the astronauts had unloaded the module Harmony of the space shuttle Discovery, a big cylinder-shaped part which should soon take up the European and Japanese scientific labs.
This module is a kind of landing stage for the module labs.
But one must be able to supply them with stream.
It was the second task of the occupying, a 17.5 metric tons module to the stream production about solar collectors which was already on the International Space Station, to move to bring it in his final position.
After she had moved it, the occupying came along to the restructuring of the solar collectors of the module whose span amounts to 76 meters.
And, besides, it happened that one of the collectors which can be opened up like Akkordeone was damaged by a stuck cable on a length by chance to a meter
The restructuring was stopped not to damage the collector even more.
The astronauts who leave originally for a controlling way the space shuttle Discovery and then another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty should repair, felt constrained to devote itself to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was selected, at the end of the 30 meter long remote control arm of the space shuttle which had been attached in that of the station, to walk to carry out the repair.
He is one best Spacewalker  (Wetraumgänger) of the NASA.
Largely, resistantly, very much skillful, he has a well developed upper part of the body and long arms.
The 46-jähirige qualified doctor was selected, verletzten  solar collector to operieren .
After he had exactly examined the damages, he split the faulty cable and fastened a kind of rails on the damaged place.
He was supported from second Spacewalker  which remained near the sluice, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupying.
The tools which he used a mini-hockey stick, in insulator wraps to prevent an electric blow on the solar collectors which generate several hundred volts, the astronauts had thought up aboard the station and gebastelt .
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was opened up completely, before he counted his tools and returned in the station.
Yesterday afternoon the astronauts half a day of relaxation enjoyed, before today seven astronauts on the space shuttle Discovery returned to start the return flight to the earth probably Wednesday.

The choice of the status quo
On Sunday it will not become exciting with the counting up of the urns: The mass of the Russians will decide on president's Putin party, combined Russia.
After a very bolted election campaign she confirms her striving for stability, even to Autoritarismus.
Three days before the parliamentary elections Russian president Vladimir Putin directs news emitted on the public transmitters to the voters which was already taped, indeed whose contents are kept secret, nevertheless.
He does this in his quality as a top candidate of combined Russia, the pro-Kremlin party for which an overpowering victory announces itself.
Yesterday the president let nothing look though when he received the foreign ambassadors, and was content to deliver a new attack point against the west powers which are accused of the interference favorite subject during the election campaign.
Wir know the price of a truthful democracy and expect to us honest choices, extremely transparently and openly, choices without fraudulences , he added.
From view of the opposition they have made a mistake there.
They prangert an election campaign stained by suppression.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says, there would have been niemals such dirty choices, not even in the time of Eltsin .
After the suppression of the demonstrations on the last week-end, counts to ex-chess world champion Garry Kasparovder for unauthorised demonstrating by five days of custody visit ban had been condemned, according to his lawyer furthermore.
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus 
After these parliamentary elections without tension two much continuing questions set themselves up:
 Who will start Putin succession as a president?
Yesterday the office newspaper has announced the date of the first ballot of the presidency choices, 2nd March, 2008; the candidates have to time 23rd December to announce themselves.
Because he was chosen in 2000 and was re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot line up for the third mandate as a result of.
And now no successor is found.
Which role will Putin play after March?
Prime minister?
Chairperson of the majority in parliament and the omnipotent party combined Russia which will select government and president?
Whatever it will be, by the parliament choices or by the presidency choices, the present power will triumph.
This is a tradition.
Die Russians have retained integrity the mentality of the homo Sovieticus, they are not man of her destiny , thinks sociologist Lev Goudkov, manager of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the state university of Saint Petersburg goes back even even further: The middle-class society has only very slowly developed in this land which became five centuries after Europe christianisiert; the famous community spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s Putin has gone back to the model of a paternalistischen state again what was completely accepted by the population, the more, because no terror followed this new Paternalismus, but a certain economic prosperity, means Maria Lipman of the Carnegie endowment.
Today verzichten  the Russians aus to free pieces on the personal responsibility  which they have displayed after the decay of the USSR for a short time.
Wozu still consider long? 
This phenomenon concerns all social classes, including the business world.
And the administrative élite knows how to hold the status Quo: 65 governors (from 85 Russian region chairpersons) state the local electoral lists of combined Russia.
The new freedoms coming from the west are often synonymous with chaos, how in the 90s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense the Russians will also not be right for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Wozu still consider long?
Those which are in power are not so bad, why they remove? 
A heavy memory
After they were treated more than 60 years confidentially, are the Nazi archives of bath Arolsen which document the destinies of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler's regime now freely accessibly.
Till present the 47 million documents of the archive which are accommodated on a total length of 27 kms in bath Arolsen could not be seen, unless with humanitären  intention, thus individually and namensbezogen, thus on query of a former victim or his members.
Eleven Staaten-darunter commissioned with their management Germany, France, Israel and them has agreed in May, 2006 to make them for researchers and historians accessible.
After the ratification process of this decision was concluded, the opening is valid since yesterday.
Awkward information
The access of the historians to bath Arolsen will enable to pursue investigations, vor to all about the deportations of prisoners, the passengers of the concentration camps and the state of health of the forced laborers , explains Reto to masters, leader of these archives who are administered by the international committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Up to short several states, under it also Germany against it, these name-related documents for the general public were still to be made accessible, on account of the awkward character of certain information.
As for example the supposed homosexuality or the spiritual impediment of some deportation victims.
The passenger's lists of the concentration camps or the arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for practical reason: The civilians who had deported or had been subordinated the hard labor, to find, and to deliver to them, perhaps, an evidence of her arrest to flatten the way for her compensation to them thus.
Still today more than 300 festival employees work on in bath Arolsen ten thousands of personal inquiries.
Still, a part of the scientific community shows only one restricted interest in the access to bath Arolsen.
Man may expect nothing basically new in these documents , had Pr. Wolfgang Benz, leader of the research center for anti-Semitism of the technological university of Berlin, in 2006 explains.

Approach final year-Rally aheadies to the stock exchange? Disagreement with the experts on account of the US-mortgage crisis
With just five weeks up to the annual accounts on the stock exchange the investors already rub themselves the hands in view of the next final year-Rally.
The experts can still provide with respect to that no sure predictions.
Banif believes that rein looks statistically which walks along December on the stock exchange ordinarily with a positive market development
It is nevertheless advisable not to provide predictions at short notice and only on the basis of statistics. Above all not when tensions to be taken seriously determine the topical market events
Although other experts do not favor such a strong course increase during the last weeks of the year, these still mark that der stock market course from given liquidity of the market and the market participants is determined. These invest on account of the lack of sure stock funds primarily in pension fund which is strongly concerned by the aufwertsverlaufenden trend to to assets rich in yield.
Therefore the stock exchange will show a rather lateral course trend influenced by market fluctuations according to opinion of these experts rather, vor to all because we cannot estimate yet the magnitudes of the possible decline of the interest rate of the US issuing bank, an insecurity above all on the risen crude oil price and the danger of the increase of the inflation rate is to be led back. 
Javier Barrio, chairperson of the sales department with BPI in Spain, agrees with the fact that it is a risqué time to announce a forthcoming Markt-Rally.
Die chances do not stand very well , assures the expert.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost since his Höchstmarke on the 8th November from 15,945.7 points a value of 4%.
But not all experts divide the same negative opinion.
In view of Juan Solana, analyst with Intermoney, could conclude the Ibex 35 as a result of the restructuring of the investment fund and the traditional, every year in this time carried out Bezuschussung of the pension fund, the year successfully with nearly 16,000 points.
The expert still emphasizes that this year the things could develop a little bit differently; above all on account of already in the second December week, and, therefore, directly after the bridge day by the day of the constitution, taking place final year-Rally.
In the opinion of the analyst the price fluctuations would not influence the market trends.
According to appraisal of Federico Olucha, analyst at bank Inversis, the present judgements are to the market position at a nearly technical level what could lead to it, dass itself soon a divergence from the index values could draw, magnitudes depended on the results of the US-mortgages market crisis.
The analyst trusts in the fact that these are positive.
With the choice of the values which should speed up the Ibex to new maxima the analysts agree.
Solana von Intermoney protests that dieses year the big values are in the row. 
The expert would count two major banks and some real estate companies to the worth winners, da the stream sector at the given time will be too expensive. 
Meanwhile Federico Olucha of bank Inversis assures that the increases walk along in connection with the bank sector and industrial sector.
If the Rally really occurs, the real estate companies will profit from her.
Die Automobile Club of Switzerland was during the last months on Aufholkurs and we hope that other real estate companies like Ferrovial and FCC smash the same way,  thus the expert.
Concerning the raised consumer behaviour during the Christmas Day the periodical consumption will determine in the last half of the year the market events.
On the other hand, the expert believes that also the technologies achieve positive sales results, even if they are represented at the Spanish market only in low number.
Five times in seven years
During the last seven years December showed sinking course courses only in two cases.
When end of 2003 the technology bubble burst, this led the stock exchange from her crisis and initiated at the same time the real final year rally last up to now.
This year in which the Ibex 35 caught up about 28.17 percent points December a course increase of 6.68% showed.
Whether in 2008 the fifth gainful year as a result of becomes (the Ibex rises since January by 8.36%) and also an Endjahresrally can show, will appear.

A total of 200 of it are settled in the economic-strongest regions of Spain.
For the institute which operates Max under the trade name Popular these establishments signify a big landmark.
But also dares for the remaining Spanish institutes, because Popular as the first bank group shows the jump to extend the opening times of his branches weekdays to 20.30h and to begin on Saturdays from 10h to 20.30h.
The bank group BBVA, likewise the lengthening of her opening times in the establishments repeatedly are reported read, has caught up to now still no definitive decision.
The negotiations running at the moment of the bank with the trade unions seem to be aimed at an arrangement with which 75% of all branches are closed on Saturdays and open for it on a weekday in the afternoon, even if not for the clientele.
Whether other banks of the new initiative join which adapts itself to the commercial opening times, bank will depend on the values of experience of the Popular.
And just this is also the intention which pursues Popular with her project.
Purpose is to extend the opening times of those branches which can grasp the purchase-amusing clientele of independent, small and medium constant enterprises, but also those of big department stores on account of her position.
The bank would like to open new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months, because it concerns not new, but changed opening times.
For it the bank will reshape the rooms of those establishments which are already in commercial zones, and they adapt at the same time to the individual customer profile of the different zones.
Thus the extension of the opening times is connected with a new spatial arrangement of the branches which distinguishes itself by a more topical, more colorful design.
The responsible bank representative Á ngel Rivera assures that the restructuring requires no bigger investments, but with a raised personnel setting would walk along, because a branch needed now no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The establishments which will be equipped even with additional rooms for the KMU will sell no financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has tested his draft already in nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, thus Á ngel Rivero.
The establishments of the streets Bravo! Murillo, O'Donell and the grain Vía have been selected for what a clever decision seems to have been.
Popular leads at the moment approx. 2500 establishments.
And other 60 which operate under the name Mundocredit. These are specified on immigrant and show likewise enlarged opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax the model of the BBVA is not used, because most from them, instead, a wide choice will offer in not-finance services to the sales.
Wir would like to show for our customers no competition , explains Rivero.
With Telefonica they have come provisionally to the arrangement to sell mobile phones help of external bank staff.
Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles for the first time his stock market value and overtakes therefore his rival Antena 3.
Wir have created it. 
With this sentence the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, with close of the stock market made known his contentment. The transmitter escorted by him had raised his value by double of his rival Antena 3.
Nevertheless, an aspect damped his joy: Das is exactly that what me is injured; not that we a higher growth, but that we lower losses had , he found out.
He stressed that they have much too deeply sunk in spite of the weak market nicht. 
Yesterday Telecinco finished the day with a plus of 2.54%.
This profit diminishes his present this year's losses on 15.66%.
Now according to Bloomberg the goodwill reaches the 4,488.88 million euros and Mediaset controls the main interest of the capital (52%), and Vocento is involved only with 13%.
Yesterday rival Antena 3 lost 1.52 percent points and has to announce since January a loss of a total of 40.5%, so that his market value with 2,193.46 millions amounts to half.
The market value of other listed communication-enterprises, however, rises; in case of from Sogecable on 3.571 millions, with Prisa (publisher of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2,518.53 millions and with Vocento on 1.779 millions.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it itself um two similar enterprises acts , according to Vasile.
Uncertainly still appears the question in which circumference we can operate really technically on the stock exchange for which price and how we can form it at customer level lucratively.
Telecinco explained his plan one week ago to climb up this year to the first television broadcasting station with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenue. Of this insured Guiseppe Tringali, the managers of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.
If the plan should be moved, the transmitter would increase his advertising income in comparison to the 965.4 millions from the year before on 3.6%.
In the case of Antena 3 the net turnover rose by 1.6% during the first nine stock market months (up to 734.4 millions), while the Nettoeinkünfte from the television business could show only one increase of 0.7% (630.4 millions).
The analysts see the main factor for the stock market course better in the comparison of Telecinco with the high Payout-Ratio which the company could show up to the current time: In 2006 veranlasste the enterprise escorted by Alejandro Echevarría a 100-percent declaration of dividend.
Nevertheless, Vasile assures that the Ratio could still vary after the purchase of 33% of the shares of Endemol, with Mediaset as a parent company, even if it is still too early for an official announcement.
Wir are obliged to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even if we have bragged up to now always substantially more.
I hope that we can satisfy our stockholders this year whose stock values we could already increase by the purchase of 33% of the Endemol shares.
At the moment after statement of the analysts the market shows certain loss trends.
Lehmann Brothers reduced only recently his profit calculation with Telecinco for this year about 4% and for 2009 about 7%.
This is the result of the shortening of the prospective increase rate which will go back in 2008 from 10.5% to 8.4% and in 2009 from 5.5% on 5.1%.
This has also lowered the prospective profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 about 4.5% and for 2009 about 7.5%.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: places on his high actual yield and his lasting potential and recommends, hence, the purchase of both stocks.
2.
Caja Madrid: if Telecinco misses (buy) as a result of the vielfachen incentive  and the prospering market a more advantageous position with than Antena 3 (hold).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends in view of the ähnlichen menaces  (saturated market and worse economic climate) the expectations in both cases to put back
The congress agrees to the guideline of the MIFID which came into force on the 1st November.
In parallel with the parliamentary elaboration which finished her meeting today with the congressional decision in the senate about the Zusatz-/accompanying to the project proposed amendments the government published the regulations which arise from the new law, with the intention to allow the introduction of both regulations up to the end of the year.
The representatives of the different enterprises praised unanimously the efforts of the congressional representative and senate representative which had pursued in her negotiations and votes the purpose to put up the best possible regulation which guarantees the security of the investors and adjusts the single enterpriser's activities to guarantee such generally efficient market events.
The MIFID which fixes the security service order anew pursues in addition to modernization of the finance markets an improvement of the investor's protection, the rise of the controlling claim of the Spanish security committee (CNMV) and the support of the cooperation between the different controlling authorities of the European Union.
The new guideline enables to offer to specified companies as well as in natural or juridical persons finance consultations and, in addition, contributes to the establishment of new finance service enterprises (ESIS), the consulting firm which unite with the investment societies and mediation societies of securities.
Moreover, she extends the number of the systems of the execution of financial transactions, so that the multilateral systems of the stock broking and the systems are added to the adjusted circulation markets to the internationalization of the commercial orders which would step, in the end, with the topical economic actors in competition.
The law obliges the investment enterprises to make known the main focuses of her enterprise profile, the confrontation and the forms of the contact with risks at the market and to register all carried out plans to make easier her controlling task thus the CNMV.
The economic committee of the congress intended even other changes in the Nachhinein and the decision that the debenture provided with titles must count now on account of her high risk degree to the investor as komplexe  funds has been confirmed by the US mortgages and bank crisis. (US-mortgage crisis)
In addition, one used the introduction of the guideline for the legal containment of the fields of work of certified economists; 30 years after the 1977 the order which limited the fields of work aloof for the economists was remitted.
The senate fixed on his part new positions in the finance sector, like those of the Wirtschaftsmediators which works on foreign calculation, needs no authorization on the part of the CNMV and can offer his services to the commercialization of products and to the customer production at the same time to several investment enterprises.
The harmonized consumer price index (VPI) has risen in November by five tenths and now lies with 4.1%.
The indicator, the euro action to of the judgement of the inflation rate within the European Union serves, delivers in Spain in November taken place average price trend.
His publication corresponds to the principles of euro action and the European central bank (EZB) which aim at a local comparison and at high-class comparison to US products by the announcement of the data.
The prediction for the indicator can be provided prematurely, while one applies the same approach like with the harmonized consumer price index, but at the same time still uses various other statistical modelling methods not to estimate at the time of the calculation to available information.
Nevertheless the Spanish statistics office (INE) sent a reminder that the prematurely ascertained indicator serves only as an appoximate value, and, hence, with the final result which is announced in coming 14th December must not agree.
Der consumer price index (VPI) will remain furthermore at a relatively high level 
After statement of the acting head of the government and the Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister of Finance Pedro Solbes, the increase of the VPI in November is a temporäre development ; at the same time this assured that the prize index remained during the coming months furthermore on relativ high  level.
Solbes still found out in the halls of the congressional building that selbst if the current number is not good  which has stayed the same inflation difference of Spain to the other members of the monetary union during the last years mehr or less .
In addition, he explained that there in November of weniger surprises was  as in the preliminary month with which the government did not count on a so high increase.
Wir expected a value from about 4% , announced the Minister for Economic Affairs and Minister of Finance in view of the prediction published today.

There other sources of information report about the putative order payments Morales to a galizisches building contractor which intended the end of a town planning contract in which the cultivation of a 200 hectare surface was decided.

Bono agrees to accept the candidature PSOE in Toledo and, case of an election victory, in the congress.
Former Secretary of Defense José Bono has accepted the offer of the head of the provincial government and secretary general of the socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. He will state Demgemäß the list of the PSOE candidates by the coming general choices in Toledo and, take over the office of the congressional president in case of an election victory of the socialists.
Thus have it José Blanco, organization secretary PSOE, and Bono in the press conference announced, after today in the head office of the party a meeting with Zapatero took place.
In the opinion of the head of the government the offer of the former minister is justified, because it is in the policy wichtig to be able to count on the best  and Bono sich considers among the best. 
In addition, the politician coming from the Mancha would run for election in case of a victory for the socialists by the coming choices after allem appearance  as a chairperson of the congress for the party.
Bono would substitute for Manuel Martín as congressional presidents. This had announced in past 15th November to line up no more by the next general choices, to finish his career in the public policy and to exert itself, instead, in the universitären area for the climate protection.
The former minister had to admit that the head of the provincial government would have pressed since his resignation two years ago continuously for his return to the political events.
Moreover, he pointed out to the fact that the party, like with the appointment of the vice-president for economy, to the citizens does not want to keep who would take over post of the congressional president in case of an election victory, and called this as Akt of the transparence .
If he should really take over the office, he hopes the chamber in Haus of the respect and not the insults or the shouting  to convert to let seem more and more similar they thus Bürgern. 
Bedauerlicherweise one wins every now and then the impression, as if the only place in which one cannot talk in Madrid quietly and let is the congress; thus the head of the provincial government was interrupted in the senate once up to 26 times. 
At the same time he praised topical president Manuel Martín and seine good work  and indicated, he does not want to wake the appearance to have taken over already the office, because, otherwise, his political opponents would call this as Arroganz .
Climate propaganda
Because the climate debate put the sceptics of the climate change as well as those, with respect to that a social and political debate in the foreground, submits to a pitiless criticism, the movement as whole ones must display a strong cohesion.
Above all if it concerns a leader of the movement who, like in case of head of the provincial government Zapatero, the fight against the climate change for more important holds than the fight of the Islamic terrorism and even suggests concluding a neuen contract with the planet .
This suggestion brings him, nevertheless, in explanation need with regard to the action, or non-action of his government which has contributed decisively to the fact that Spain within the EU stands at the head of the lands which have fulfilled the default of the Kioto protocol in the least one.
Who are the persons responsible for the non-fulfillment of the default on which sectors this is to be led back, and why his government which had suggested Vertrag with the planet  has not stopped this development.
Now, in addition, he is made demonstrate measures against the climate change without circumlocutions to the Spanish citizens from him intended.
Which companies will be concerned by which behavior of the citizens should be changed to which individual and collective economy measures must be carried out and which economic results arise from it.
Precise said who must sacrifice itself and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
Indeed, it has and there will be in future no such explanations.
Just because it is for itself about sacrificing and the payment.
Since the measures which can be used against the climate change really are unpopular.
They are rich in costs, uncomfortable and menacingly for the accounts of the companies and citizens.
Even that of the PSOE suggested gasoline cent seemed to Zapatero electoral-strategically seen so dangerous that he felt constrained to take back the suggestion again.
Now accordingly it is a matter of saving the planet with Nothing, thus with pure propaganda and empty sayings without every real consequences.
With impressive statements, committees, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet the so suitable politician otherwise for electoral campaigns neither must talk, nor accuses, nor demand, follow, instead, however, the demanding issue to decorate the meetings and to inspire others with his gentleness and goodness.
However, this can happen only if the contract does not deviate from his purely virtual nature and also does not give, therefore that the bicycle becomes from now on the only locomotion means or we may refresh ourselves only with a field.

My family doctor hands one of his long, strange research articles with the title to me: Geld leads to activation of certain cerebral areas, above all if other agree more of it. 
Thus the feelings originating from the monthly salary payment are dependent on the salary of the colleagues.
The study was provided help of a tomographisch magnetic authoritative analysis at the university of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the science-magazine Science.
After statement of Bernd Webers, author of the study and manager of the Bonn brain research center Life*Brain, war the activation strongest when the participant gave right answers and his player failed, however. 
The researchers could recognize that the cerebral activities were always very moderate when both participants with her answer lay properly and got, therefore, also the same salary; but if one of them received the double one, it also came to a stronger cerebral activity. 
I am not quite sure to me whether it really requires so much scientific expenditure to reach to such a result.
The state lawyer from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte already searches for eight years relentlessly for the criminals of the Balkan wars. Their official residence is in the public prosecutor's office of the penal court of law of former Yugoslavia, resident in La Haya.
Their mandate will run out at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a weeping one and a laughing eye, because the main persons responsible of the massacre of Srebrenica - with which 8000 Bosnian Muslims died - are since ex-general Ratko Mladic and former serbo Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic furthermore at large.

Which assurance is suited for me best of all?
The KFZ assurance which covers a possible case of damage caused by the driver contain a high expense whose height takes down rerum on different factors, among other things from age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the car to be insured and his use, etc.
A car is to be owned only the beginning.
Since the suitable KFZ assurance is to be found even difficult as the right vehicle model.
At first once must be clear to one with which we have to do it here.
A car insurance is an arrangement between an insurance society and a policy holder.
This arrangement is held on in writing by means of a contract of insurance which fixes that the society receives the arranged insurance premium and is obliged as a countermove to present the suitable sum of indemnity with a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an assurance which consists by several factors, among other things age, gender, time of the production of the driving licence, marital status, kind of the vehicle to be insured or his use.
The insurance enterprises settle her prices accordingly of the statistics, so that with a higher accident danger also higher contribution payments become due.
That's why less contribution payments must perform about 25-year-old as well as women, because statistics prove that these groups show a lower accident rate thanks to her care.
The same also counts to married persons, because these incline after statement of the statistical values and, therefore, also after conviction of the enterprises, to less accidents like single.
The use which is attached to the vehicle impairs the frequency of the driving and with it also the likelyhood of an accident.
The more often the use, the more probably the damage.
By the installation of the premium the assurances must take into consideration a whole row of points.
That's why the driver must also study the situation thoroughly to select exactly the car insurance which meets his personal needs in the earliest one.
We list at this point now the most important points which one should consider with the choice of an assurance to be able to meet not only an achievement, but also a choice oriented to price.
Among 25-year-old hit with a choice of an inexpensive assurance on numerous obstacles, as for example the low driving practise and junge  driving licence.
Even if it was the best for an ideal insurance cover to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance, there are still less expensive alternatives.
The careful drivers can select a Vollkasko with deduction, so that the achievements of a full fully comprehensive insurance are covered, indeed, but are offered for a low price.
Of such type from contract contain that the customer must pay a part of the amount resulted by the damage himself.
Der amount is fixed before end of the contract and with the help of the height of the insurance premium. This is higher the more slightly the sum to be paid , explains Luis Noguera, general agent of Spain with ridge Europe, to a mediation enterprise for on-line assurances.
Another option is the enlarged assurance which insures of the customer against external accident damages, not, nevertheless, against the damages resulted in own car.
In addition, theft, fire and vehicle loss would cover of such type of the assurance.
Here a council.
If you are 25 years old under, it lies in your hand to lower the insurance costs; thus your credit increases, while you try to go carefully and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a lowering of the base rate at the suitable insurance society.
On the contrary in addition contain a penal payment an increase of aforesaid rate.
Die height credits and penal payments depend on the society and their yields.
If the enterprise has a year rich in yield behind itself, it can allow itself to raise the bonus payments , explains Noguera.
As soon as the 25-annual brand is crossed, it is to be concluded for the drivers more simply a contract. Reason for this is the fact that with increasing driving practise the accident rate sinks.
Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction.
Normalerweise can pull the youngsters no use from her present experience, in case of an accident as well as at the time of the driving , does not explain the Spanish director of the European enterprise, and adds that the majority of the accidents occur in the second practise year, after Angst of the beginner  was filed.
Still it is with a married customer who owns no children to conclude more advisable, a full fully comprehensive insurance; of course only if it also admits the financial situation of the suitable person.
On the part of the insurers married couples with children count as the customers with the slightest accident rate, and accordingly low her contribution payments also fall out.
In this case a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 300 euros) would be the best option. In the case that one has received a high credit, an enlarged assurance which starts only to the third vehicle year is recommended.
Sie go all together more relaxed and own a bigger purchasing power which allows to them to attach a higher contribution payment , ascertains Luis Noguera.
For pensioners it is obvious to conclude a full fully comprehensive insurance with deduction (with an amount about the 150 euros), or an enlarged assurance which starts only with an enough high credit.
At last one must stick that the car insurance is something very important, not only because she protects the driver against possible accident damages, but also because she rescues high costs which require that a thorough choice is dripped which corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Milan for the point for round of the last sixteen
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point which they lack to reach her respective purposes still before end of the Championsleague qualifying round. The Italians need to reach sharp at to the point of her group, while this decides with the Scots on her participation.
The Italian team already has five points and have confirmed her participation already in the fifth round with a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine points needs still an other one to make sure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not catch up the Befica Lisbon with four points.
Two plays of the group D will take place one week before end of the sixth play round, because Milan FC must line up in the FIFA club world championship in Japan where he will fight in the 13ten in the semi-final for the first time for the entry into the finale which takes place in the 16ten.
Thus this group will be concluded before all others and the draw in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the result expected everywhere, even if both teams will will try to win. The Italians will not want to speculate at home since the Keltik Glasgow knows which they would become in case of a victory of groups-first and would dispose with it of a better starting position in the round of the last sixteen.
A defeat could be enough even with a setback of the FC Shakhtar for the team of Gordon Strachan to qualify. Still he should trust not too very much in such circumstances, because with nine points Level the participation is entitled to the Ukrainians; indeed, they had lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but with the second play could win (2-0).
Therefore, the Melanese will try to spoil the evening for Scots. The rerum hope to reach for the second time as a result of the round of the last sixteen of the reshaped Championsleague, after they were defeated in the vorrangehenden play season in the exactly same round by a gate of Kaka in the postplaying time (1-0) and by a zero to zero draw on the first leg.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory Rossoneri , the team will have to concentrate upon own play, because take down the achievement of the round of the last sixteen as well as his membership in UEFA on his victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could in spite of his lower table position and without view to be allowed to take part furthermore in the biggest European mastery, join in by a victory the third place and therefore for UEFA.

New fears about natural gas quarrel between Russia and the Ukraine
A new prize quarrel smolders between the Ukraine and Russia what raises the danger that Russian exports are impaired by fuel to Western Europe.
The biggest part of the Russian natural gas exports in the European Union (EU) is escorted through the Ukraine and every quarrel between both nations is very exactly observed.
Kiev has warned about the fact that if Moscow raises the price which it must pay for the natural gas, it will charge for higher transit fees of Russia.
An earlier conflict between both states last year diminished deliveries in the EU states.
The latest quarrel between Kiev and Moscow happens at a time to which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, state gas monopoly Gazprom try to reach an arrangement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom must be calculated to the Ukraine more, because the group has agreed to pay up to 50%, in addition, for natural gas from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that the Ukraine must pay 40% more for the imports of Gazprom.
" It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states in conversations ", the Minister for Economic Affairs of the Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the news agency said Reuters.
" The changing natural gas prices should be connected certainly with our arguments with regard to the height of the transit fees [to Western Europe] over the Ukraine. "
In the last big natural gas quarrel between Moscow and Kiev in January, 2006 Gazprom shortened deliveries in the Ukraine.
This led as a result of to a case of the exports to Western Europe what forced up the prices drastically.
Russian gas puts out a quarter of the care of the European Union.
Russia has the worldwide biggest gas occurence, but a lot of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements his own stocks with gas from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS " must control foreign employees "
The Scottish state health service must improve the controls of the record for employees from outside of Europe, said a member of the controlling body. outside
The recommendation of the main finance controller Robert Black came, after a foreign doctor was brought in Scotland in Zusammmenhang with the poster on the airport by Glasgow in June.
Black likewise pronounced about that doubt that the Scottish state health service disposes of no precise images concerning the number of his ausländischischen employees.
But his report pointed out to the fact that other important controls were carried out with a random check by five health authorities correctly.
The main finance controller examined staff which was recruited beyond the lands of the European economic area, as a result of the poster on the airport by Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor in the Royal Alexandra hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport, after a cross-country vehicle was driven by the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in October in the Old Bailey in a videotransference, and was loaded in connection with the supposed autobomb attack in Great Britain.
It is expected that the state health service carries out controls in the approach of the employment of foreign employees to guarantee that these own the necessary qualifications, experiences and Autorisierungen to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities Disclosure Scotland are of use for the examination of record, the agency does not dispose of the competence to receive this information beyond Great Britain.
Now the report of the main examiner says, beside other recommendations that the board of directors should take up guidelines of the penal register extract which helps employers in controls in different lands.
" Although we have found tips to these controls in some personnel documents, these were not carried out as a matter of routine. " if the report ascertained.
Black said, the Scottish health authorities would follow her investigation guidelines before the employment with high degree, but added: " Our report indicates areas in which the system can be improved to guarantee that precise information about the number of the foreign health service employees is available. "
BMA Scotland-presiding Dr. Peter Terry said it is "extremely unlikely" that investigations would identify people in the approach of the employment of potential NHS employees who could commit future terrorist posters.
" In the report one says that momentary preemployment tests Scotland NHS well function and it is not clear which increase in value the recommendations will deliver ", he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they have at the moment 1.161 foreign employees, the prevailing majority of it doctors and nurses.
However, the finance controller warned that the number is probably higher, also, because the boards of directors would have problems to identify those employees who are given time off indefinitely.
The investigation found out furthermore, that have been kept predominantly set up controlling procedures by authorities NHS in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian.
Passport, work permit, and qualification controls belong to it.
the Scottish government checks nowadays her policy and guidelines for controls before the employment beginning for foreign staff in the NHS.
The secretary for health Nicola Sturgeon said: " It was to be explained to me a concern this work in view of the terrorist attack on the airport of Glasgow. "
She complemented that the Scottish government, in connection with the health authorities, the recommendations of the report would take into consideration and guarantee that itself the best methods would become in updated guidelines with regard to the controlling investigations in the approach of the employment of all employees wiederspiegeln - under it also those from abroad - whose publication the next month is planned.

Arabia arrests in Saudi 208 because of a terror plot
Yesterday Saudi Arabia has uncovered that it has arrested 208 militant because of her affiliation to cells which had planned a forthcoming attack on an oil arrangement as well as on priests and security forces.
The state television of the world-biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathizers of al-Qaeda have begun a campaign against the monarchy which is since 2003 an ally of the United States, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militant, stated by a foreign citizen, planned a poster on an oil arrangement in the eastern province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000 strong quick Eingreifstruppe to protect Quaida poster on the world-biggest oil processing arrangement in Abqaiq in 2006 Anlagennach to an unsuccessful Al.
The report, with reference to an innenministerliche explanation, says that 18 of the arrested belonged to a cell which was escorted by a "rocket expert" who immigrated illegally to the land.
He reports that the militant had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom.
Other 22 of the imprisoned planned according to the report to kill priests and security forces.
The government has warned priests against acting more to stop Saudis who strive to Iraq to get together with Al Qaeda militia which wants to fight against the allied armed forces and against the supported Shiite Muslim government which is looked by the hard liner among the sunnitischen Saudis as heretical.
Al Qaeda militia looks at many priests in Saudi Arabia as in collaboration standing with the authorities in the support of the policy of the royal family which dominates the government.
The militia - accompanies from calls of Osama bin Laden, in Saudi Arabia born Al Qaeda leader to be aimed it at the prowestern Saudi government - it have refrained on foreign residential areas, government buildings and arrangements of the energy sector.

Among the arrested were also 32 people who were accused to have made available financial support to the militia.
The climate on the Venus could reveal a view of the future of the earth
The Venus was maybe once a pleasant place to the life, said scientists yesterday.
Data of a European spaceship located on an orbit show that the planet resembles a turned away twin of the earth even more than up to now was aware.
The Venus is the näheste planet-aryan neighbor of the earth.
Both worlds own about the same size and have similar planet roads, indeed, the Venus of the sun is a little closer.
Before billions from years would have ruled on the Venus conditions which would have been very similarly to those on the earth and could have been even inhabitable, believe scientists today.
But because of the carbon dioxide greenhouse effect without brakes, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar irradiation and a slower rotation tempo the Venus smashed another developing course.
Today the planet is robbed by water and has a surface temperature which is hot enough to melt lead and is laid waste by hurricane-strong hoists and flash storms.
The knowledge of the space probe Venus express train of the European space agency which has examined the planning for a year offers a sobering look at how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic changes in climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department of physics at the university of Oxford, one of the leaders of the Venus express train mission, said: " It becomes clear, why the climate on the Venus so passed away to that of the earth is, while the planets are quite similar to themselves otherwise. "
" Our new data enable to construct a scenario in which the Venus has begun before billions from years like the earth, possibly with an inhabitable environment. "
" Fortified uranium " from the police confiscates
Yesterday 1 kilo of radioactive material, according to reports Fortified uranium, was confiscated by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material is checked.
He did not confirm whether it concerned fortified uranium, but said that it are sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds) would have can.
Everything still openly
Mitt Romey said, he holds it of no presidential candidate worthy to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the republican candidate agreed for the presidency, in the end to position himself to a debate on YouTube in which normal voters take up questions on video and submit to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions which were thrown up on the Wednesday evening, 28th November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party conferred with.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected this time exactly the state of the republican party which opens in the choices next year.
It is not known, precise like the producers by CNN, which the debate to the cosupported ones which selected the beginning candidate YouTube to be shown clips.
However, in the first half an hour of the debate which was dedicated longest to a single subject immigration stood in the center.
The subject is one of the most efficient subjects for Republicans.
A group of undecided voters asked the CNN to serve a Wählscheibe if they heard things which they liked: The television company noted points of the approval as the candidates strictly about the borders spoke.
The most sharp and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national forerunner, and Romney who has pushed in the determining surveys in Iowa and New Hampshire forwards.
Giuliani tries to shake off the call, he has been compliantly concerning unlawful immigration when he was a mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in he the former governor of Massachusetts accused, unlawful immigrants for work on his house to have put.
The both sat down especially violently apart as a questioner asked whether one of the candidates gave an "Amnestie" (the unlawful a regular status and the possibility on the citizenship) would support.
More unimportant candidates like Duncan Hunter, a California congressional representative, and Tom Tancredo, a congressional representative from Colorado, it succeeded with this subject nachzuhaken.
None of both men has serious chances with the nomination, but both remain in the running, maybe because they have lashed out earlier and harder than other on the immigration kettledrum.
At least in the area of the immigration the candidates divide on the whole the same views: more sharp borders, intolerance towards unlawful migrants.
This subject, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other worries about the rest of the world, the differences help the Republicans between liberal and Christian conservative to forget or to minimize.
But the debate became unambiguously problematic as other subjects were brought up.
Mr. Giuliani was asked, which is why he has supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drowning should be looked as a torture.
One of the questioners asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to the fact that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is his preferential book, he thinks the history of Jonah and the whale maybe not literal.
Another questioner asked whether of Jesus the capital punishment supported.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations on the first place in a recently carried out survey in Iowa thanks to his Christian Konservativismus existing for a long time - said that the capital punishment is painful, but necessary.
When he was pushed for whether of Jesus she would recommend, he laughed at it and said of Jesus was to be promoted too intelligently around himself around a political office.
The running stays open extremely far.
Huckabees rise in Iowa falls together with Ron Pauls to the latest donation success and his thunderous applauses in the debate of Wednesday.
These both are sent up from Nothing because both wings of the party could not agree up to now yet on one of the more known and more traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000 a candidate has the party from the outset and persuasive combinedly with a victorious message about the size of America and a wink to both wings of the party.
This time is split the party and the result is not clear by far.
Pains of the Labour party
Gordon Brown has discovered still an other pit to the Hineinfallen; his way from this remains the same.
For British scandals this is not especially slippery.
No titles of nobility seem to have been sucked sold, politician's Paris hotel calculations paid-uply, no illegitimate toes.
But the disclosure that a rich businessman has veiled donations for the British ruling Labour party about more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) more than four years under the name of other people, and that the party has failed to announce this is something without the fought Gordon Brown would have well got by.
When two months ago the Prime Minister had avoided the demand for a choice, in stupid way the intelligence of the Britons insulting, while he stated that opinion polls had not influenced this decision there was hope that he would offer a robust, efficient government.
Instead, like Vince Cable who expressed keen representation chairperson of the Liberally democrats, it in increasing litre of beer the once dreaded Brown of Stalin has developed to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern rock, a groggy bank, showed regulatorische weakness and bad judgment property under bombardment.
Badly thought-out suggestions for the change of the tax laws have raised enterprise federations against the government.
The tax-official loss of personal data of 25 million people indicated inconceivable administrative botch-ups.
A trio of generals in the retirement started to an uprising in the Upper House in protest against shortenings of military expenses: To be a minister of the armed forces, they stated, is a part-time job.
Now there are the varied donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours secretary general (and her earlier fulfilment leader) has already withdrawn.
Nothing means of the fact that Brown opens definitely in the direction of exit.
Governments can still reach a turning point, after they it feel impossibly to rule.
Neither may trust nor people to politicians, hold back, however, them ordinarily her scepticism if a new troop seizes the office.
If it is clear once that it is unlikely that a prime minister improves the situation, and he does not need to be present yet long, this deferment is over: the civil service starts to become leaking; the cabinet ministers start to chat; the press looks for bad news; and the government becomes defensive and aimless.
In a way the position of Brown is especially difficult because it cannot claim in contrast to other political leaders to be a new broom.
So with pleasure he would deny Tony Blair, he was his first lieutenant.
The problems with Northern to rock and the tax competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions which Brown met as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if was involved not directly in Blair's bad luck - as with the long " money for title of nobility " investigation of political party financing - the voters possibly assume from the fact that he was it.
Nevertheless, Browns position is not so bad completely as it looks
The misdemeanours are not so awful as the conservatives describe them.
As with Mr. Bean, nobody has died, or was totally swindled out.
And the antidote, painfully how it may be is to be delivered what Browns have always promised of course Stalinist trends: A reliable, respectable and slightly crude government.
The new fuss around political donations is a good example.
Garboeske Abrahams which compares his donations to his charitable gifts says he wishes no public recognition for his goodwill.
This may be maybe like that, but the decision on it was not entitled to him.
The laws against anonymity for big political contribution payers are clear and they exist for unequivocal reason: the general public has a right on to know who can buy itself access to those which govern the land.
Watts, that says he would have known about Abrahams arrangement, but not that she is unlawful, will have to position itself naturally of some questions; exactly like Jon Mendlesohn, Labours Hauptfinanzeintreiber whom about the odd donations was told in October.
However, up to now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that points to the fact that he knew about this confusion, although the biggest part of the payments was done after his office takeover in June.
Up to now the prime minister has done half of the work.
He has condemned fast the injury of the laws by his party, but he diluted this determination by the griffins after a known instrument, has led to an investigating committee on the subject - to fill the measure, from a bishop in the retirement and a judge.
In this case the " apprenticeships to be pulled from it " are not complicated very much.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
Apart from the fact there are other things Mr. Brown must do to find how a little bit one permanent chairpersons for the independent committee for standards in the public life which is unoccupied since six months and to progress with a drastic reform of political party financing.
This would require from the hard liners of the Labour to cooperate with the conservatives and to give up, perhaps, the special financial respect with the trade unions - the bitter pills for a party member like Mr. Brown.
But he should be aware of some biased facts.
Now the conservatives have a clear guidance in the opinion polls; he has to win back two years around voters; and the only way, as he can reach a victory, is by indisputable righteousness and respectable competence.
Map sharks
Is the loan crisis of America credit card market infectious?
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural, that dorsal fins excitedly herumwirbeln.
Now where property market of America ails, the predators have the credit card market of the land in the visor.
Analysts of Goldman Sachs calculate on the fact that the credit card losses could reach 99 billion dollars if the infection danger of underfinanced loans spreads out to other forms of consumption loans.
Signs of the strain are clearly visible.
There are increases by the writing offs as well as with the default rates which measure the interest of the loans which are not retractable in each case or too late more than 30 days.
The HSBC has announced last month that it has taken 1.4 billion dollars of fee elevation from her American consumer's financing, partially because of the weakness of credit card takers.
It is still too early to go to ruin in panic.
Losses and defaults are still low.
According to rating agency Moody the third quarter-default rate of 3.89% nearly a full percent point was under the historical average.
The deterioration with the rates can be explained partly by technical factors.
A change in the American private insolvency right laws in 2005 led to a sudden case of declarations of bankruptcy which put out again for a big part of the Keditkartenverluste; the number of the registrations (and with it default fees) would rise again whether the general conditions on applicant for the credit get worse or not.
The industry also reports about respectable payment rates which point how much from her debts the consumers every month pay off
and the trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, in spite of the shutdown in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research enterprise, calculates on the fact that the issue amounts will be 25% higher for 2007, in the end, than the last year.
There are direct infection canals between the real estates loan crisis and the credit card market absolutely: it is more likely that consumers take up credit card debts, now that own home loans dry up.
However, the map exhibitors look at the monetary river instead of on capital values, therefore, falling house prices do not release necessarily a change in the creditworthiness of the applicant for the credit.
They can be an advantage even for the map exhibitors.
The incentive sink for consumers to pay furthermore the mortgage rates if the real estates are less value than the value of the advance; as a result the map debts under the repayment priorities become more important.
Map exhibitors can also react much faster and more adaptably than credit grantor to the stormier conditions, while they change interest rates or loan borders.
This should reduce theoretically the risk of a quick new assessment of the assets.
" We will wake of no day and revalue the advances completely ", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance adviser.
Even if a sudden untercover crisis is unlikely in the credit card market, the risks of a lasting recession are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a loan decrease push America in the recession, the industry will stand certainly before a more fierce future.
If they hold to wide look out after these shark fish fins.
British Bänker confess guilty in the case Enron
Three British bankers who should be put for her role in the deceitful system with the former main finance leader by Enron, Andrew Fastow, in court changed her requests in guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had innocently pleaded originally for seven cases of deception at the risk of tele-communicative devices for the supposed Konspirieren with Fastow in a confidential finance deception in 2000 to get rich at the expenses of her employer on.
The procedure had been attached for January.
But during a hearing in court before US-district judge Ewing Werlein junior everybody pleaded for a case of deception at the risk of tele-communicative devices guilty.
Three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unity of Royal bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years.
In the United States her case is a loose end of an investigation which was begun to Enrons breakdown in 2001.
The accusations originally submitted against them in 2002 drew the attention of Fastow to the fact that it was the purpose of an investigation of the government in connection with the Enron decline.
The accusation against the bankers - called the " NatWest Three " - maintains, they have come in 2000 to Houston to cook up a deceitful plot with Fastow and his former top adviser Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a partnership of Enron which was controlled by Fastow which was the architect of countless deceitful Enron machination which has served to tear the company in the bankruptcy whirlpool.
In the beginning of 2002 the bank had estimated the value her participation in the subsidiary at zero, but three British men knew that she had considerable value in reality.
An enterprise under Koppers control acquired the shares of the bank in the subsidiary for 1 million dollars.
The bankers paid Kopper 250,000 dollars for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation Fastow represented falsely compared with Enron that the energy enterprise would pay 20 million dollars to Greenwich NatWest for her shares in the subsidiary.
But really the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and other about 12.3 million dollars skimmed milk, according to the accusation.
In January, 2004 Fastow confessed in two charges on conspiracy for his role in the Enrons bankruptcy guilty.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow sits out a 6-year-old imprisonment in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper sits out a punishment of three years and one month in an equipment in Texarkana.
Each of three men was at large on grounds of 1 million dollars of security which required that they lived in the United States in expectation of the court procedure.
Enron, once the seventh-biggest enterprise of the nation, crumbled in the bankruptcy in December, 2001, after years of buchhalterischen tricks could veil no more longer the billion debts or schwächelnde enterprises profitable allow to seem.
The breakdown destroyed thousands of workplaces, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans from.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former chairman of the board Jeffrey Skilling were condemned the last year for her roles in connection with the Enron breakdown.
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays convictions for conspiracy, deception and other charges became trifling, after he passed away the last year because of heart illness.

Likewise at the first night said Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, a company the high final cars with high final alarm systems equips that his company has sold garish orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionnaire.
Up to Sunday afternoon said Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A.Connection, an enterprise, the deluxe car at customer wishes adapts, he would have sold three Autokühlergrille for a Rolls Royce phantom which resemble with each other tied up chains arm tyres for 55,000 dollars in each case.
He showed to a reporter a tire which was developed for a Russian casino owner, with the spokes which he had covered with colored Swarovski to crystals, so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The costs: 22,000 dollars for a 4-substitute.
" The Russian millionnaire who would like to have bunches leather wheels or a picture of the face of his wife of cubic zirconium will not necessarily go on these wheels ", said Mr. Karapetian.
" He will keep it in his 30-or 40 cars garage. "
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said, the phrase " Russiche of millionnaires " would not express at the moment a lot of exclusivity, in view of the increase of the local real estate prices.
" If you have bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they are supposed already millionnaire, at least on the paper if already in cash ", he did not say.
" There is more of those than you believe. "
Those which were no millionnaires could act at least in such a way, as if they were rich in a state which was pursued by Alliance Continental, a Russian administration of property enterprise.
The enterprise had put up four red phone booths according to British model which were stuffed with mountains by wrong millions-dollar lights.
Azad Karryev, the marketing manager of the enterprise, said his employees if 500,000 wrong bank notes had printed out for the millionnaire's fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around the monetary heaps, mobile phone photos, while they lean back in the midst of the spare wealth to let take pictures from friends, or simply in order to pocket a few millions.
" See, in Moscow everybody can feel like a millionnaire ", said Mr. Karryev.
Bungled operation supposes with death in New Jersey
It was the day before the Thanksgiving Day as a Ronald Livingston by the big glass window Precisely a Little Healthier restaurants here saw and observed like an ambulance in the white cape Cod two doors further below in the west Scott Avenue stopped.
Soon afterwards was there a police car.
And then was there another.
" Then I saw the truck of the medical coroner approaching ", said Livingston, a proctor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
" This was the point as me knew that somebody had died. "
The Behören found out that the dead Mrs. Olga Arroyo, 41, was, an assistant of the manager of the Newarker police department.
Now the investigators try to find out whether she died because of a procedure which was carried out by a not admitted, cosmetic surgeon whom the police did not identify, and in the house in the west Scott Avenue 212 worked.
The authorities have not ascertained yet what Mrs. Arroyos death has caused, and are hopeful that the toxokologische investigations whose results could not be available for weeks will help to clear up a mysterious death which has sent a grief by the leadership point of the Newark to police.
Mrs. Arroyo was an assistant of the police manager, Garry FOLLOWING McCarthy since September, 2006, and her voice was known to many in the department.
" She was loyal, hard working and stubborn ", said Mr. McCarthy about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
" It was my pit bull.
She protected me. "
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the Mrs. von Jimmy Arroyo, to a former Newarker police officers who works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission, and that she leaves two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the public prosecutor of union county, Theodore J. Romankow, said that investigators would try to find out whether Arroyo passed away as a result of a not admitted, surgical treatment.
" This is one of the possibilities ", said Mrs. Walsh.
" It is a running investigation. "
The authorities said them have come in the house at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon in November.

More than one week has passed and the authorities have informed a little about her investigation or about the owner of the house who is performed as a Flor Margarita Castro.

The investigators try to find out whether a part of the house was used as a medical practise.
On Wednesday nobody opened the door in Mrs. Castro house where a wilted rosebush stands in the brief front garden and a Dalmatian barks behind the house.
A blue barrel marks with " Ethyl of vanillin " - used as a substitute with vanilla in food and perfumes - sat in the parking lot beside a door which led in the basement.
Two mountain bikes hung from hook on a side.
McCarthy said that it came as him for the first time in Newark, after he had spent police department 25 years with New York, was Mrs. Arroyo of incalculable value and helped itself, besides, to him in the provincial and hard political culture to find the way in his new town.
" She said, ' you must pay attention to this or that ' ", he said.
" She was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was embarrassing. "
Hopes the central bank the interest will lower lead to the increase of the world stocks markets
Yesterday the stocks jumped on both sides of the Atlantiks, after market hopes that the central bank will will try to calm the loan markets by other lowerings of interest rates were encouraged by appeasing comments of the vice chairperson of the US central bank.
The stock markets rose in London, New York and in whole Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairperson of the central bank, said that the policy must react " adaptably and pragmatically " to the persistent pressure at the finance markets.
In a clear effort to calm verdrießliche markets, at the sight of sign of ambitious loan tensions, said Kohn, the latest turbulence would have turned back " partially some of the improvement of the market functions of the late part of September and Octobers ".
Should the raised turbulence continue, it would raise the possibility of an other increase of the financial conditions on consumer and enterprise, he said.
The comments were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready, to intervene and to stabilize markets and possible other lowerings of interest rates the loan terms with new capital sputter in the US.
The executions helped also to calm the embankment Street, at the sight of other bad news from the US economy, now there the sales from US real estates a new record low-pressure area in October reached.
The results of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the investment bank, that she will remove 650 workplaces, or 4 percent of her worldwide employees, in a measure for the cost reduction to compensate heavy losses from her lost bets in the US-mortgages loan sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London where the bank occupies 1,500 employees.
In New York the Dow Jones industrial index jumped about 331 points, or 2.55 percent to close with 13,289.40, while the wide-invested S*P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close with 6,306.2 what added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British defaults.
Index of Germany Dax rose by 2.6 percent and CAC40 of France rose about 2.3 percent.
Before the reappearance had been underlined by loan pressure on the markets, after strong inquiry were lent to an auction of the 3-month-guarantee means of the European central bank which were granted to the European mercantile banks to substantial 4.7 percent, the highest rate since April, 2001.
The pressure to the bank from England, the US central bank and the European central bank to follow and to feed other capital means into the monetary markets in London, rose when one saw rising the loan tensions three months of "Libor" rates to the lending between banks UK with 6.59 percent on her highest since late September, after a continuous increase since the 21st November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each of it almost as difficultly as the other.
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka who should meet the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairperson, on call is at least under this special title, here to decide to help of coach Peter Moores and captain Michael Vaughan in it, and because the table of High Morries, the English managing manager, bit by bit with applications fills for national electoral offices, if not even for which in partial time.
Whoever the sixth racquet position does not agree, will be unhappy, but the life is often unfair and the sport is indubitable it.
It is never easy, precise to nail what enables a person to reach the point of his branch of profession, while not everyone never comes out about the lowest rank, sometimes for lack of luck instead of ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the choice is difficult where judgments are necessary which are subjective always at the end.
Is it to be climbed up the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he acts?
The same one can be asked maybe also in another area whether, for instance, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both the intelligent young executives should be carried with good end which know the business well.
Who can say what is the right class for a cricketer, unless, to him the possibility is given, to swim or to set.
Naturally figures have a big influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team a cricketer must catch the eye of the captain at the right time if he can take a Wicket and a racquet must get regular chances on the order if he wants to do impression as a one-day cricketer.
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complex.
There were many, which in the last season better than, for example, when James Anderson were who will apparently play in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison explains himself for healthy and how the wind bowls in the nets.
Anderson took 32 high-class Wickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 by the same modest average, but both had her highlights and hope on even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara in the Asgiriya stage plays, only one view question can be.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it does maybe, nevertheless, little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first, nevertheless, with five Wickets and runs with 40 useful, it was Paul Collingwood to strengthen at that time still fighting around himself which created the breakthrough to a significant test cricketer and who, although he dotted a double Hundred against Australia in Australia, is maybe still underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and moor, after an other discussion in the course of the today's net meeting in the Asgiriya stage will follow her conservative instincts and belly feeling for Shahs bigger experience about Boparas youthful enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah his sparkling and valuable 88 Test-Debüt-Innings speaks in Bombay, 43 high-class hundreds and only six of Bopara which is younger at the age of 22 years seven years and an excellent balance against turned on balls.
But Shah did only ten runs in his two Innings in the May against west Indies in the test in lord, his home arena as a player from Middlesex, and this, plus his immediate refusal of the Auswählern was healthy as a Vaughan to take back his position for the next play, seems to have taken the swing from his hitting which was still evident in Bombay.
By contrast the Alleskönner from Essex has shovel-wise joy of life.
He is impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his posture apart of it was summed up when he had recently skipped a vehicle with 4-bicycle impulse in an exhibit for sponsor of England Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and presumably a shock, but the first what he did, his Vodafone (of course also gesponsort) was to be got out and to call his team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from a distance and to say with enthusiasm: " Have you seen this? ".
Bopara is a lot of better player, he bowls his middle tempo with some effect here on the fields what seems to fit to him and hits with confidence and talent.
The right man is to be chosen a thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe this is the real art of the choice.
Now I bend to it Bopara to give his chance what does not mean that, nevertheless, Shah will not well maybe stand there if, as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests, he is that which will play here this week-end.
Buses bring refugees back to the work - and to fight against Al-Quaida
The first bus loads of Iraqi refugees from Syria came in Bagdad yesterday, with a stream of expelled whose finances or Visas have run out, and other which hoped that the town returns to normality.
Some had even come back to fight against the rebels whom they had expelled from her houses.
In the bus railway station Mansour, even before of the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was actively with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transports.
" I decided to go to Syria, after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad ", said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer doctor.
" Today I came back, because of that what I have seen on television and what I have read in the newspaper, about that what has happened in Bagdad, and how it would be sure now. "
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people ", he said, in relation on the Schiitenmilizen of militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, has ordered to put back his forces at the current time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite teacher from the prevailing sunnitische part of Amariyah, returned with his both children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because to work the regime Iraqi not permissibly.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to say to him that a local militia supported by the USA has served to expel al-Qaeda from her bastion in the west of the capital, and penetrated him to the return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader sunnitischen and Shiite trunk which had been expelled from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad by an attack with grenades, after he had requested his fellow citizens to the fight Al-Qaidas.
He was come back to fight.
" Two days ago some of my friends called me and said to me that they began one the Anti-Al-Qaida-Miliz in Sleikh and that they need my support and which of my boys.
This is why I have returned today ", said Sabaah aluminum Obeidi, 62.
Many told that they had been lured by the increasing rest in the capital since the US-troop rise and the growth more locally " groups of members of the public aggrieved by the proposal " which arms and in collaboration with the American military her town quarters defend.
But more spoke of having been forced home by visa problems and drying up finances in Damascus where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled during the last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old triple father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, the Syrian government had requested to cover visa restrictions for the refugees to force people to the return.
More than 2,5 million people have presumably fled from the sectarian Todesschwadronen in the land.
" It well went for us to al-Maliki Syria visited and the government urged to the Iraqis no more visas to give to force them to the return in Iraq ", said of the sunnitischen pensioners.
" I cannot trust to a government which supports the criminals, my house of burned down ones, after I left. "
A part of the reason for the decline of the power is that Sunniten from Shiite residential areas and vice versa were expelled what led to the creation of many places where tensions have decreased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will poke sectarian tensions again and it will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading with the professional training and shines even with the international adjustment of his colleges.
Only in an educational field the same deficit presses the Saarlanders like the rest of the land.
" Yesterday I have explained to the 50-th time to a non-Saarlander that we are no French " - the smallest federal state placards this slogan self-ironic to his 50-th birthday.
Besides, France and Luxembourg play a big role in the education system of Saarland which lies in the educational monitor of the institute of the German economy Cologne (IW) on place five.
Thus the colleges already cooperate from tradition narrowly with the neighboring countries.
The university in Saarbrucken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Till this day students can conclude here her study with a double or even triple certificate.
The interest of foreign students with 15.6 percent is accordingly high.
However, also the natives Saarland brings in above-average number to the colleges - many of them without end in the high school.
" In Saarland one uses the professional education system ", says Axel Plünnecke, educational expert with the IW.
More than every fifth youngster his study authorization acquires in a vocational school, with it Saarland lies more than seven percent points about the federal average.
Also the possible combinations of professional and academic education are developed relatively strongly.
Measured in the population figures the equipment with binary study ways second-best is in Germany.
In spite of the practically oriented education and rising inquiry the number of the engineer's graduates has sunk during the past years, nevertheless, by a third.
This is why the Saarland ministry of education has obliged the colleges now to a marketing campaign for engineer-scientific fields.
" At the general schools we have stumbled according to the first Pisa study several reforms ", says a speaker of the ministry of education.
Thus the government introduced national comparative tests.
So that to learn to start the children earlier the last Kita year is toll-free - a model which, in the meantime, also other federal states copy.
Whether the achievements of the pupils improve with lasting effect, only future comparative studies will point.
Near Pisa in 2003 shrank the interest of the risk pupils from 29 to 20 percent.
Nevertheless, all together Saarland increased not so strongly as other federal states.
The Bavarians better count.
And to the frustration of the Saarlanders Fremdsprachenkenntnise are not measured near Pisa - otherwise, in this area one could score.
Since the language of the neighbors is a duty in high schools - even if the Saarlanders are no French.
Chávez moves the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks soon differently tick than in the rest of the world.
On the 9th December president Hugo Chávez lets the time knives in the South American land around half an hour turn back.
In Spain Chávez becomes meanwhile the joke figure.
As the official gazette of Venezuela informed, the clocks are put according to a new law for the world time below 4,5 hours.
With it the südamerikansiche state gets a time zone which there is in no other land of the world.
The USA-hostile Chávez explained his decision, among the rest, with the fact that the United States of the world had imposed the division in time zones by full hours.
Besides, Chávez discontinued the demolition of the relations with the neighboring country Colombia announced on Wednesday (local time) because of a hostage's affair.
The left nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe Präsident of Colombia remains, he will maintain neither to the head of state nor to the kolumbianischen government relations.
" I cannot do that quite only because of my dignity ", said Chávez which speeds up a constitutional reform about which the citizens of the oil land must vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform he would clearly develop his power in the land.
Trigger of the quarrel was the decision Uribes to take away from Chávez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia with whom it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe has spitted Venezuela with his decision " in the face ", had criticized Chávez on Sunday.
Also in Spain Chávez is in every one's mouth.
A new mobile phone ringing tone provides in the land for sensation: "Por qué no te callas" (Why you do not hold the mouth) there is the sentence which itself already more than half a million people from the Internet have downloaded.
There has spoken him king of Spain Juan Carlos who was irritated at the latest Iberoamerika summit by the constant interruptions of the left populist and had gone to this over the mouth.
Wage deficit threatens German in 2007
In spite of the strong economic situation this year a real wage loss threatens German employees according to a prediction.
Experts called a whole bundle of reasons for her pessimistic prediction.
According to a calculation Hans Böckler-Stiftung the employees could count in 2007 really with less on the salary discount payment than in the year before.
" A guilt for it are the modest wage development, the value added tax rise and the prize pushes with food and energy ", said Gustav Horn of the institute of macroeconomics and market research of the "Bild" newspaper.
New charges could also come up with the unemployment insurance to employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said newspaper " to the " new Osnabrücker, the planned sinking of the unemployment insurance on 3.3 percent at the turn of the year is right in the current position, indeed and reasonable.
Indeed, the federal agency may not come for work again to embarrassment to have to ask at the alliance for loans or subsidies, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday had become known that the prize explosion did the inflation rate on the highest state for 13 years with food and mineral oil products.
The prices rose all together in the annual comparison by 3.0 percent.
Venus is the infernal twin of the earth
The Venus is intended in spite of her life-hostile atmosphere of the earth more similarly than up to now: The European space probe " Venus of express train " has discovered flashes in the atmosphere and wind whirl to the Pole how they appear in winter also on the earth.
For nearly three decades scientists suppose that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe has produced " Venus of express train " the proof - she tracked down electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The flashes on the Venus shoot at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory" flashes let the life on the earth originate: Thunderstorms should have stimulated in the ocean reactions which led to the education of amino acids, the stones of the life.
Not thus on the Venus: " If was one day life there, it must have been in the very early history ", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today there might be on the surface of the Venus barely something living: The atmosphere is thicker about hundred times than on the earth, there rule every now and then temperatures of 500 degrees.
" The Venus is maybe the devil's twin of the earth, but she is a twin ", said Russian
Why the Venus which is so similar to the earth in mass and size has hit such a totally other development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The start of " Venus of express train " in November, 2005 was a landmark for the Venus research, because since beginning of the nineties no more probe was on the move specially to the investigation of this planet.
The newest research results which are introduced now in several "Nature" articles underline in the opinion of the researchers not only the uniqueness of the Venus within the solar system.
" You also show that the common characteristics of our neighbouring planet with the earth are bigger than at first accepted ", informs the Esa.
Thus the researchers also found a cloud whirlpool in the South Pole which still turns substantially faster beside the already known whirlwind on the North Pole.
The phenomenon reminds of airflows on the earthly winter hemisphere, writes a research team around Giuseppe Piccioni about the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The most second-internal planet of the solar system has almost the same mass like the earth and is big with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers almost just.
The planet also called morning or evening star circles in just 225 days round the sun.
However, he turns much more slowly on himself: A Venus day lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees centigrade and a pressure of 92 reminds cash barely of the earth, scientists assume from the fact that both planets have originated under quite similar conditions.
On both water collected which remained on the earth in oceans, however, on the Venus got lost in the space.
And while carbon dioxide on the earth is fixed in carbonate rocks, it puts out on the Venus the large part of the atmosphere.

Street battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns about riots like in France.
Everything must be done, so that social discontent does not discharge in Germany in power on the street, demanded the Federal Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burned, hooligans shot with shotguns at the police: After the heavy youth riots in France Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDP) fears a similar development in Germany.
" We must pay attention to the fact that also with us social explosive is not based and unloads in power.
We must take seriously this ", he said to the " new press appearing in Hannover ".
Not every young person manages with the quick change of the social reality.
Alliance, lands and local authority districts already worked with stress on diminishing problems, said Schäuble.
This concerns not only the integration by migrants.
" From the integration summit up to Islam conference points the already first success. "
Nevertheless, for all-clear it is too early.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time to the fact that there are not town planning and sociological problems like in France in German suburbs.
In northern suburbs of Paris youngsters had delivered heavy street battles with the police to themselves at the past nights.
Also in Toulouse cars and public buildings burned.
The chairperson of the Turkish municipality demanded meanwhile bigger integration efforts of the Federal Government in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France Kolat warned about "imitation effects".
Indeed, the position in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
However, there is still action need.
Kolat referred to the fact that the rate of unemployment is with youngsters with migration background less than 25 years " exceptionally high ".
It must be provided above all for more education places.
Kolat stressed: " We must give a perspective to the youngsters. "
However, the chairperson of the Turkish municipality added, in Germany " a social control in the families takes place more than in France ".

In the empire of Angela Wolke
The unrealistic appearance of the chancellor documents that the coalition is as regards content at the end - and that from herself nothing more is to be expected.
In which land does this Federal Chancellor live, actually?
After her hopeless appearance in the general debate of the Bundestag which wurschtig and was poor in contents one must say: not here - not in the land which would have to be governed by her, finally.
Angela Merkel with a badly haughty sentence has rejected the reproach that it concentrates too much upon the foreign affairs.
This is provincial, she said and showed with it only that she does not want to understand what it is for the critics about.
In the Bundestag she has documented for everything recognizably, how much their reproach applies.
There neither concrete interest nor even a feeling was to be felt for the problems in the land.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a removed politician who flees in the foreign affairs and remains even there in the approximate.
Example climate protection: There she praises herself without braking for the decisions of saint's dam, however, does not say how in this country the climate purposes should be reached.
Generally, the selfpraise - so much presumptuousness would have denied itself the CDP boss still two years ago.
Now she clings to the empty phrase that the impetus comes with the people.
With it she damages her image as the pragmatist who solves problems instead of the world schönzureden.
But in the empire of Angela Wolke domestic problems are a secondary phenomenon.
Child poverty and the worries of the low breadwinners?
She has a few subordinate clauses for it, for the rest.
Besides, it is typical, how often she makes a slip when it is about the children's allowance.
Merkel needs three approaches there to bring out a more or less straight sentence.
She trips like on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete.
Department of attack
In the Youtube debate of the republican presidential candidates both favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney deliver to themselves a hard exchange - and now must fear an outsider's candidate.
The strain of the candidates already discharges with the first subject.
He has done New York a " sanctuary for unlawful immigrants ", Mitt Romney accuses of his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This counters on his part with heavy reproaches: " I would say, his own house was a harbour for unlawful ", replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having occupied privately immigrant without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: Because the republican base has furthermore no clear favorite, eight presidency candidates use the debate on CNN above all to discredit her opponents.
The selfrotated 30-second videos in which Internet users via Youtube have sent barely are more than one.
" With this kind of isolationism we let come Hitler to the power ", accuses John McCain his opponent Ron Paul who demands an immediate deduction from Iraq as only in the round.
Also Romney agrees from the Vietnam veteran hard read the riot act when he refuses which is simulated so-called "Waterboarding", a questioning method, while drowning to condemn as a torture.
The fact that the important subjects of the campaign lie, in the meantime, nevertheless, on the other side from Iraq war and torture debates, the reactions of the hall audience point in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax rises are rejected, applause on surges in the lecture hall.
Besides, appears once more where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
" At that time I have wandered ", explains Romney contritely and performs before base and television audience for it apology that he belonged in 1994 still to the abortion advocates.
However, Giuliani comes to the rolling when he is asked according to his opinion to the literal interpretation of the Bible.

Soon after his swearing Musharraf will lift the state of emergency according to Chief State Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum and fulfil an other demand of the west with it.
The uppermost court of law of the land which Musharraf had taken after the Verhängung of the state of emergency at the beginning of November with him weighed lawyers had rejected all objections against the controversial reelection of the head of state last week on the 6th October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern family region Nord-Waziristan in a poster on a military convoy and four other ones were injured.
According to an army speaker the bomb on a street exploded near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the herbal rock return
Supergroup of Germany of the seventy-year-olds makes music again: Three tape members of Harmonia planned for her consoles with a concert in Berlin once more.
To the revival a recording from her big time " appears Live in 1974 ".
Even then they were substantially more famous abroad.
Then the fixed sensation occurs in the form of three sedate men in the evening board.
Everybody has his small box before itself, his cables and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius sits enthroned in the snow-white shirt at the age of 63 years in the middle.
On the left flanks from Michael Rother, 57 years young and in the possession of laptop and guitar.
On the right, from the lecture hall looks, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 curves, concentrates in the console.
Everybody contributes noises, every now and then even a beat.
And sometimes it submits by mistake to a customary piece of music.
Then this also seems to disturb men even not largely.
The fact that the volume Harmonia makes music again, has provided among herbal rock-lovers for some excitement.
And one may reveal here: Specific inquiries proved that the name whirred, indeed, through the collective pop memory, but by no means so with lasting effect to miss this tape for 32 years painfully.
But why should the German not be allowed to celebrate also his living legends from the seventies?
Particularly as that what calls delusively herbal rock, counted in England and America always more than in own land.
When the music economy lent to the survivors of the Cologne group Can in 2003 the echo price of life work, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
As the Red Hot chilli Peppers to itself in the eulogy still with the volume La Dusseldorf and Anew! thanked, the surprise knew no borders.
With concerts Michael Rother crouched later with the Red Hot chilli Peppers on the stage like an old pal.
Away from home that is the problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration one.
The memory is demanded too much if only for that with Harmonia because the trio only two years existed and unfolded in this time also a far lower effect power than them afterwards from others was assigned.
Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler already before under the promising name Cluster.
At first one played in the cellar under the Berlin show stage.
Afterwards in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons for one flat label maintained by the church.
Rother had briefly helped out with power station and afterwards as a guitarist with Anew!, the German group most radical maybe at that time, a call wins.
However, about 1973 Rother followed the cluster musicians into exile after forest in the Weser mountainous country.
There, in the old Weser court, ruins from the 16-th century, they lived as a town-brief Kommunarden.
Less ideologically than in the local authority district I where might slave Roedelius still as a nanny.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist's existence.
Supposedly a pennon of the song association Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art a name was also found in the bulky refuse.
Something held on Harmonia of it.
The first album called " music of Harmonia " and the following "De Luxe".
Since thus let and give the music also sounded, the tape suffered material need.
The brushwood collecting served not only the Selbstfindung.
The CD appeared now " Live in 1974 " was recorded with a concert in Griessem, before a just 50-headed record scenery, as somebody believes to remember.
At that time from Rother came the wish to force Harmonia and to practice now and then.
For Roedelius and Moebius an indecent demand.
The tape explained in 1975 her separation.
Rother landed in the esoteric-spherical and protected itself his existence with albums like " blazing hearts ".
Cluster was animated in the eighties again and is more successful since that time than it was Harmonia ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company Greenland has sat down it to the purpose to maintain the herbal rock as a very own German contribution to the living music.
Anew! besides, it was already dug out like Roedelius solo work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Publicly subsidized, within the scope of the festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the manual " herbal rock of sampler ".
There the Love Parade inventor Dr. is also a moth.
With which the whole range of the influence of the herbal rock on the following pop music would be outlined.
Besides, the empty place of the supergroup is filled by Harmonia.
The sentence of Brian Eno floats with the most strange sounds in the hall: " The only true music, you hear the future. "
There are pictures which show the producer with Harmonia in the farmhouse parlour.
Projections of other black-and-white photos of chaotically cabled tools serve the laying education.
Before it three veterans are occupied with the improvisation again.
No more, while they stick microphones to the organ and in the percussion to draw incredible tones of the instruments over self-tinkered effect devices.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tinkerers detailed in the technical.
The choir of the house also changes nothing in it.
Under the management of Barbara Morgensterns it is coughed under sound clouds and is whispered and at a nice place with emphasis " Aaaaaaaah! " chanted.
Herbal rock was always a very English concept.
It never concerned rock.
The roots were searched less in blues, than in colleges of music (Can), technologies (power station) or on the run before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Who here " in '68! " shouts, is not wrong completely, and Harmonia can be brought by it also now not from the rest.
Still the most natural is roofed on the stage thoroughly.
Where does music start and when does it stop?
This can rob one of the nerves or give brief moments of big luck.
Richard Gere is not simply cynical enough
Two films with the Balkan war deal with " The Hunting of party " and " of murderous peace " again.
However, both are not convincing.
Either the drafts place too much on action and Geballer or, however, them are too soppy.
There Richard Gere can also not help in " The Hunting of party ".
The good news first: Indeed, the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but just there, now in the sombre hinterland of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere has been found again.
We had lost the nicest man of the eighties years last out of sight because much too many nice-insignificant roles drove out the desire for glance in films for good sensations for women and much too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism to one.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, himself " The Hunting party - If the hunter becomes the hunted " (Why must film titles be so long today, actually, always and be weird like train driver's wage agreements?) to consider maybe, nevertheless.
He delivers a wonderfully winking representation: Basically his war reporter Simon Hunt is that what could have become from Gere if the destiny and the film branch were not so merciful: A man who has his very best times long behind himself which has still preserved substantial rests of the former charm, however, itself as the monument same to ruins of his decline.
But in spite of this trump " The Hunting of party " continues only the endless row of failed Balkan war-films together with the German production " of murderous peace " which likewise starts this week.
With " murderous peace " one can do short process: The film acts from two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian before kosovarischen sniper on which to itself one falls in love promptly still in them.
Although it is welcome that here once the Serbians are not shown as a sole root all evil, the television-level film loses itself much too fast in Geballer and action.
There remains a kind " alarm for Cobra 11 " without highway, however, for it with war.
Against it can be investigated in " The Hunting of party " virtually exemplarily, why there has never been, actually, a really good Balkans-war film.
The history of three US-war reporters who start to track down the Serbian upper war criminal " the fox " could have become with another director and another scriptwriter (both in personal union Richard Shepard) another time maybe new "Apocalypse Now".
Since the stories are similar remarkably: Both times go small teams to the wood to accomplish something what the military cannot do and both times it becomes a trip in the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of " The Hunting of party " is that one does not allow to be Simon Hunt simply the dilapidated cynic with heart when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the Script must still impute a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnierin to him in addition.
Finally " The Hunting of party " goes brook under it when the reporters within the last five minutes in the time-lapse photography procedure manage this what Nato, CIA and all reward hunters of the world have not created in five years: The war criminal catch and leave to the Muslim Bosnians to the fair revenge.
This is so bad that one would like to call the international court of law in Hague because of crimes against the film logic.
Besides, the film has a profoundly human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic walk around still freely, and he suspects the Americans and here the French (should agree they exceptionally sometimes) to pursue the pursuit on account of confidential political arrangements not too intensely.
But the well meant and this Nastily are sometimes so similar to themselves that to one a famous Brecht's poem comes to the sense.
In it one says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the working table of the poet: " Compassionately I see the swollen forehead veins, suggestive: how exerting it is to be angry ".
Films like " The Hunting of party " have exactly such Schwellköpfe which indicate, however, how exerting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of the Balkan war film.
Recently is in this newspaper reports become that all Iraq films of Hollywood were big flops.
One can add: There has never still been a good South Africa film.
Almost always counts: If a star on the crisis stoves or mine fields of the world hangs around, besides, such a thing comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, " beyond all borders " with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All conflicts are chronologically simply possibly still too close.
Decades had to pass, at least, before Hollywood with " roofer's list " could turn a good film about the Holocaust.
Some film will probably still mature - the Vietnam works counting now as a classic " The Deer of Hunter ", "Apocalypse Now" or " Full Metal of jacket " have been celebrated at that time by no means unanimously as masterpieces.
But today maybe we know where every mass murder comes on a real-time basis on immediately two screens at home, also simply too much about the conflicts of the world.
And this robs the screenplay writers of the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it to tell good stories.
" His or non-existence "or" the big dictator " have become so good, in the end, also because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know yet how badly the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe one may not want to be good if one wants to do good films.
Maybe one must have the sarcastically reserved artist's look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When was questioned about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Wörterbuch" and the Balkan war, he answered: " This is only due to the fact that some things never change.
Cities will be dangerous always terribly, people will be murdered always in horrific way and always war will rule in Yugoslavia. "
From Beust criticism harvests for Olympia-Absage
Moving away the mayor of the application of Hamburg for Olympic summer plays has bumped with policy and economy into violent criticism.
Many further want to fight for the plays in the water.
However, from Beust realism sends a reminder by the appraisal of the chances.
The general manager of the chamber of commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called on Wednesday a renunciation as " not well for the economic location ".
No other project has recently unfolded so big motivation forces in the town like the Olympic idea.
" Without this purpose the sports-political swing would not be able to be maintained in the same litre of beer. "
Schmidt-Trenz asked the senate not to bury the project, but to find for it a new long-term beginning, " that goes out from a changed time ray ".
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with earlier statements after which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg are unrealistic at least up to 2028.
" Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic sports alliance ", said from Beust WELT online.
He referred to the decision expected for beginning of December of the sports alliance about an application of Munich for the Winter Olympics in 2018.
" This preference means for us that we will have no realistic chances in the period angedachten up to now from us till 2028. "
The dream is not still for all time ausgeträumt, said from Beust.
The Hamburg sports alliance (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
The impression is thereby woken that Hamburg wants to apply during the next 25 years no more for Olympic games.
" It is too early to obstruct a chance to themselves, while one buries the plans already at that time ", said HSB president Günter Ploss on Wednesday.
Besides, a renunciation of the application stands in the contradiction to the statement of the senate boss on the occasion of a receipt to the plenary assembly of the general German university sport federation.
There the application of Hamburg has not called from Beust for the Universiade in 2015 " substitute " with Olympic games in Hamburg.
The university sport federation had nominated only last week Hamburg as an applicant's town.
The SPD-citizens faction accused the senate of not having used valuable time for the house building in Hamburg.
" For years the development of the small Grasbrooks has been delayed by the senate because he has placed on the map Olympia and has ignored the house building ", said SPD-delegated Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While SPD has always demanded an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residential use for the small Grasbrook, the CDP has placed unilaterally on the "event factor".
The application for the Olympic summer plays in 2012 had released in Hamburg at that time a big enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg had failed because of Leipzig.
These are not Warhol's boxes
Who connects the concepts Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or, nevertheless?
Nowadays produced wooden boxes throw in Sweden dark shades on Warhol's work list.
A large part 94 Brillo boxing listed there of the " type Stockholm " are forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" has poked doubt about the genuineness of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxing of 1968 some months ago, internal investigations come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering result: Six "Brillo boxes" which former museum manager Pontus Hultén has left the Moderna Museet in 1995 as a donation are copies - and probably also the large part about hundred other Brillo boxing of the " type Stockholm " which are at the international art market in circulation.
The prehistory is interlaced, a bewildering concatenation of artistic and kuratorischer productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo boxes", painted wooden boxes which are based on the red blue-white design of the cartons of the soap powder "Brillo" in New York.
An exhibit of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 issued - by Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes from cardboard: These came (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo board mill.
It concerned not pieces of art, but their models, around bare exhibit pieces.
At the same time Warhol has given in 1968 probably the permission to let produce some Brillo-wooden boxes in Sweden which were not issued, however, in the Moderna Museet.
Now contemporary witnesses speak of about fifteen boxes which have come " type Stockholm " rightly into the art and auction history at that time as an authorized Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name.
Some of them have achieved on auctions more than 100,000 dollars.
Now the problem is that legendary museum manager Pontus Hultén has stated later falsely, about hundred wooden boxes have been produced in 1968 in Sweden and have been issued which leave Warhol to him then has.
Really Hulténs 105 boxes were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for an exhibit in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was already dead three years.
Lars Byström, Chefkonservator in the Moderna Museet, has examined beside six Brillo boxes belonging to museum also three from Swedish private property by which two were made in 1968 in Stockholm: Their pressboard records were only undercoated and sanded down, then white oil paint with a paintbrush was applied.
The structure of the copies from the year 1990 against the fact betrays that the color with a painter's role was applied without priming directly on the pressboard record - in addition, it concerns not oil paint, but acrylic color.
" These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy's Warhol Brillo boxes ", the manager of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve lets announce: " If 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' does not come in New York to another end, the Moderna Museet will class six boxes in his collection as copies / exhibit material. "
Already in July, admittedly, the Authentication Board has announced to follow the " heavy accusations " which are raised in the matter of the soap powder boxes.
However, since that time one wraps himself there in relentless silence.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila surrender
On the Philippines rebelling soldiers have surrendered who had entrenched at a hotel in Manila and had demanded fall of president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can answer for no bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes who accused of corruption and of electoral fraud the president to reporters at the hotel.
Government loyalty soldiers had attacked the hotel before under tear gas application.
The about two dozen soldiers had entrenched since hours in the building.
Around half of them stood on Thursday because of a failed putsch attempt in 2003 in court - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to retreat suddenly with about 30 sympathizers.
The military policemen who should guard him, actually had apparently run over to him and joined to his mutiny.
They penetrated into the Peninsula hotel and demanded fall of president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops blocked off the district around the distinguished hotel.
The president called up an urgent meeting of the security cabinet.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
" The people have enough ", said Trillanes.
" We call on the people to join themselves. "
General Danilo Lim who commanded earlier the élite unity the scout rangers said, other army unities wanted to join to the march shortly.
Government critics had appealed for Friday for big demonstrations against the president.
For months their government is overshadowed by corruption reproaches.
Finance district of Manila was already in 2003 a main scene of the tried mutiny of about 200 members of the armed forces against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after just 24 hours because of the refusal of the army to join.
Since 1986 there were already at least seven putsch attempts against democratically elective governments on the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder with Versatel
United Internet has protected itself an interest of more than 20 percent in telecommunication enterprise Versatel.
The average price stock amounts to 14.46 euros as the enterprise informed on the Wednesday evening.
Now one holds 20.05 percent of the capital.
On a takeover had been speculated before.
One keeps open to himself the option to raise the interest in Versatel still.
With the step one wants to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market, informed United Internet.
Before surmises about an entrance had already arisen on Wednesday, after the mountain Beren has raised bank her participation in the Dusseldorf net operator by other 5 percent on 15.1 percent.
The monetary house holds the shares only for the third party, one said in the finance market.
The day before United Internet had already taken part with just 10 percent in mobile radio enterprise Drillisch.
Within the scope of an increase of capital has placed Drillisch 17.4 millions new stocks to the value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million stocks of it for 31.4 million euros.
Besides, the enterprises have taken up conversations about marketing cooperations for DSL-and mobile radio products.
" We strengthen our partnership ", explained an United Internet speaker.
Both enterprises have founded the joint undertaking MSP to take over the competitor Freenet.
For the time being both enterprises want to be content with an interest of a good ten percent in Freenet and do no use of her right to take over other 18.49 percent in Freenet, informed United Internet on Thursday.
However, both enterprises kept open to themselves all options to raise further in particular also the participation in the Freenet AG, one said.
Conversations between United Internet and Freenet about a strategical partnership had been finished at the middle of November.
The only hardly transparent poker continuing for months around Freenet is a part of the consolidation of the Deutsche Telekom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million mobile radio-contract customers and 1.27 million connection DSL and complete connection-customers.
The holding company of United Internet and Drillisch held up to now directly 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch introduces other about four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent from the investment company Vatas had been already agreed in August.
