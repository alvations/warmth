The lack of snow in mountain bothers hoteliers 
The deserted pose no problem that operators of ski lifts. 
The lack of snow discourages people to book their stays in skiing in hotels and pensions. 
It is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year. 
We have a lot of visits on our site. 
Internet users roam the offers, asking prices but dare not commit to reserve for the moment. 
And if they call, they ask immediately if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the information portal Spindl. Info. 
If you want to spend the New year of his dreams to špindlerův Mlýn, better not too reluctant to book. 
If the priority is given to economies and that the quality of accommodation only then, then we can try to wait a few more days. 
The Hoteliers of špindler propose for the moment that stays a week for the New Year. 
I think they will try again a moment of the place, but they cèderont them and accept shorter periods. 
And then the number of rooms free will rapidly diminish, "said Jandura. 
The tourism agency Ingtours of Vrchlabí also proposes still beds of free for all periods of winter. 
The week of Christmas we are most concerned for the moment, it is not completely sold. 
There are still free, say, half the rooms in our offer. 
That is why we have already prepared a few stays Christmas last-minute cheaper, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert. 
The agency of tourism agency may also propose The New year to Krkonoše, but there are fewer empty seats. 
The 14 days of February go well, the remaining winter stays are moderately. 
This year, the interest for stays of winter has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow to Krkonoše. 
People expect it to get to fall. 
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow. 
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas also will be complete, "think Schiefert. 
In contrast, the occupation of the hotel Horizont Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year. 
It was an improvement of about five percent. 
We have few places for the New Year as for Christmas. 
There is a great interest during the holidays of Polish January and February sells well too, "said Karel Rada, director of the best hotel of Pec. 
The Omnia Hotel near the central parking of Jánské Lázně is also full to eighty percent during the period of the New Year. 
On the contrary, half the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel Jánské Lázně. 
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we have already sixty percent of occupation at present. 
February is a little more low at the moment, but as soon as the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše builds certainly still indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch. 
The Hotel of Krkonoše should not expect more snow. 
On Thursday it will be fresher and if there is precipitation, they should be neigeuses mountain. 
But the time should warm, informed Jiří Jakubský station Hradec Czech Hydrometeorological Institute. 
United States: repetition is mother of wisdom 
It becomes even comical, the painstaking effort with which Barack Obama, president the reputation of wise, reproduced the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, that he considered himself as simple. 
When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had recopied carbon paper since the Iraq scenario of Bush three years ago. 
Not content to use in the text several times the expression "as in Iraq, it has not hesitated, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech:" A new way forward " 
At the same time, he has personally criticized the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences." 
The following month, however, have shown that the strategy of Bush, who came from the recommendations of commanders of campaigns, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers currently do not speak at all of Iraq. 
This has not improved the reputation of Bush, however, objectively speaking, it has left his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope. 
Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again 
It is again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley McCristal, which has severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination. 
He asked 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable. 
The president has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, at least he had defrauded the general of 10 000 soldiers. 
He has managed to root out the promise of 5, 000 additional from Europe, even if it were on 10 000. 
This brings the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan by 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it provides answers. 
Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq. 
In spite of fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders to honour the agreements. 
The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected. 
In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them. 
The political institutions, although based officially, will remain just window-dressing behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations. 
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are further complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences. 
Even the foundation of a "state quick to act ", which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real. 
The time horizon of Obama's strategy makes perplexed by his determination. 
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and she is currently on the brink of chaos. 
Only a heart purely romantic and out of the reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "prompt return home" will bring a real miracle. 
From a political point of view, set a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will regard as the indirect admission of defeat. 
The last NATO summit has shown that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative. 
European politicians know or do not want to explain to their constituents what security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush. 
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and that the sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force. 
It will respond by example when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan. 
Each solution of this type will, however, a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation. 
The only patch for Obama is the fact that there are three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, should it prove to be a flop. 
The leaders of the bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash 
Employees senior leaders of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year. 
The company announced in response to strong criticism about its pay practices. 
The group of 30 key leaders will receive shares instead of money, they will not sell before five years. 
The actions can be withdrawn to leaders in cases where they would take too many risks. 
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs raises leading the effort to link the rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street. 
I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that we must take, "said the former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan society 
The concern is in the details, he added. 
The bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after being set aside almost $17 billion in premiums on the first three quarters of this year. 
For the current year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters. 
With the arrival of the financial crisis, large bonuses in the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries. 
Britain announced Wednesday that it would affect a single fee of 50% bankers' bonuses exceeding 25, 000 pounds. 
France is preparing similar measures. 
This year women received the Nobel Prize in all areas except the physical 
These are five women, a record number, which have received today in Stockholm at the hands of the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature. 
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller. 
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compatriot Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize for Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes. 
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes 
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, U.S. Elinor Ostrom with his countryman Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance. 
The only technical discipline that has not been winner this year was The physical. 
This award was presented today scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith avecWillard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently at the basis of all digital cameras, fax or refracting telescopes. 
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of acquisition of financial reward. 
It reached 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)

The Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus has invited The Château 
The President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which weighs his stay in government because of its disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies 
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also the position of Janota cabinet will be on the agenda of their meeting on Friday. 
Klaus also criticised the budget. 
According to him, the deficit is too important, which is widening the crisis of public finances. 
It is the presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat who informed of the meeting. 
Janota then discuss its function Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer. 
According to the legislation on the budget which will be submitted to the signing of Klaus is a deficit of 163 billion kronor that the Czech Republic should manage. 
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved Wednesday the proposals of the left transfers of money and has increased the rewards of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
The government blamed the proposals of Social Democrats the fact that they would increase indirectly the budget deficit. 
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and right on the other hand, disagreement which calls into question the future of Fischer, who had been trained by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party. 
Critics argue that the budget, as it was voted by members, removes the package of savings spent by the government of Fischer and according to stem the indebtedness of the state. 
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but that there is no requirement, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs, that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "disability irréfrénable" of public finances. 
Now there is, according to him, no positive solution. 
Only a strong government could bring an improvement, if he could rely on a consensus of political parties, according to the president. 
The president of the ODS Mirek Topolánek has indicated that the budget is staggering and that the government should call into question its existence. 
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas told the ČTK that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly more. 
In its response, the Prime Minister Fischer described such words of "drastic ". 
The head of the ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed 200 billion kronor. 
On Wednesday, the ČSSD called a success the ratification of the state budget for the next year. 
The People's Party was also satisfied. 
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film 
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans say that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will present to the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories. 
The history of sport, relations between races and Nelson Mandela. 
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded the Oscars, embodies the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and first black president. 
Freeman said, that this is a Mandela aged ninety-one years who asked him to embody in the film. 
Matt Damon plays an important role. 
I told him: "If I must embody, I should be able to see you personally. 
The actor aged seventy-two years old who was awarded a prize for his role in the drama Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery become itself slave, a fictional U.S. president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and so important to so many people as Mandela. 
The ex-homme of state South African was imprisoned 27 years for his hard work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa. 
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years. 
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Invictus is a Latin word meaning unbeaten and this is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875. 
The challenge was to speak with him. 
The film tells the true story of joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country resteencore and always divided racially and economically after apartheid. 
It is sure to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world. 
The South African team will eventually move in World Cup in 1995. 
Freeman has worked a few years to bring the history of Mandela on screen. 
I had no other purpose if not play this role to the of the reality, said Freeman. 
The biggest challenge for me it was of course, talk like him 
The actor said that if he and the politician international were in the same region, it would have tried to meet Mandela, dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech. 
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand. 
I realized that when I give you my hand, I recover your energy, it is transmitted and I had the impression of how you feel, "he said. 
It is important for me to try to become another person. 
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players. 
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh environment of rugby. 
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise. 
I remember when I come to the door of the house, I opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: "I have the air much greater in the film ". 
Despite the differences between the actors and models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive opinions and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars. 
The film critic Todd McCarthy newspaper Daily Variety summarized his appreciation in these words: "This is a very good story, a film very well done." 
In the evaluations of films on the site rottentomatoes. Com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive feedback. 
The mystery of the will in Norway is resolved: the Russians tested a rocket 
There has been a strange light phenomenon of unknown origin over Norway. 
The Russian Ministry of Defence has recognized that yesterday have tested a rocket intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border. 
The launch has still been a failure and the missile "Bulava" which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. 
His presence repeated tests of the rocket has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights. 
Most of the time, Bulava has not disappeared, or it was damaged in flight. 
The Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "missile which do not steal" 
A missile that do not steal but shining 
This 13th test took place at the beginning. 
It is only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to equipment. 
This is clearly the engine of the third floor of the rocket that exploded. 
This time, "Bulava" is soaring nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea. 
This type of missile can be fired from a moving boat and submerged 
That is why the mysterious light above Norway caused by an unidentified flying object precisely the was by a "Bulava" flawed. 
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted a moment that it is a Russian rocket. 
The generals argue that this time, we cannot talk of failure. 
The first two stages of the rocket have resisted and damage has affected only the third. 
In previous cases, the engines have experienced failures on the first floor. 
Although none of the test launches happened smoothly, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers that only six out of thirteen have been failures. 
This success rate of almost 50 percent fills the general optimism and they therefore always that one day "Bulava" fly without problems and that it will prevail even ten nuclei hypersonic a total weight of 1.15 tonnes. 
The legendary Fetissov to 51 years has signed an one-year contract with CSKA Moscow 
The legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will return in a professional match in 51 years. 
The former world champion, Olympic champion and holder of the Stanley Cup will assist his team of CSKA Moscow in need and will make its entry probablementdéjà during the match Friday against Petrograd. 
Fetissov, which ended his career to forty years in 1998, is currently the President of CSKA. 
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender. 
Fetissov train regularly and agrees to help the team. 
We must still resolve some details on the form, says the coach of club Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the agency pa. 
It was not clear whether the comeback of legendary hockey player will affect only one match. 
I think that Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental other players, "said Nyemtchinov. 
According to AP, in the case of his return on the ice, Fetissov becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player. 
In NHL, the legendary attacking Gordie Howe played a season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.

Hyundai has listened to the unions and cancels all overtime 
The direction of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with unions to cancel all overtime. 
It is precisely because of overtime frequent that unions have declared a state of emergency strike Monday. 
The spokesman Petr Vaněk plant Hyundai has confirmed. 
However, still reach agreement with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year. 
We cannot abandon our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime were proposed on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk. 
The site Sedmička. Cz indicated that the company has proposed a bonus 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday. 
It will be awarded also afterwards for the day worked on 28 November. 
The company, according to Vaněk, decided to change the way to motivate its employees in exchange for overtime. 
Either they receive the supplement for hours, or they can ask a replacement leave on 28 December and extend their end of year holidays aindiqué Vaněk. 
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for the costs of transport and for their lunch. 
Given the fact that overtime were the most urgent and the warmest in the comments and the demands of the unions as employees who have ceased spontaneously production last week, management has taken the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk. 
Until last week, employees of the automotive plant were forced to work almost daily two overtime in addition to their eight hours. 
The Unions have cancel the state of strike after signing of the agreement. 
The following negotiations between the direction of the car factory and trade unions must take place Friday afternoon. 
The union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to stop the state of strike in cases of agreement on their claims and signing of a common document. 
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees started spontaneously on strike because of incessant overtime. 
They also protested against poor conditions of pay and so-called bizutages. 
Management has defended with the fact that employees had to work as a supplement to meet the imperatives of car production. 
At the announcement of the strike Monday, trade unions have also requested that the employees who have ceased production are not subject to any sanction. 
The unions are asking the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum. 
In addition, they want this year a reward of 5 000 crowns (209 €) for them. 
The automotive plant Hyundai of Nošovice currently employs 2, 000 people. 
She started series production last year in November. 
It has produced about 80, 000 vehicles until September of this year, with a production capacity of 200, 000 cars per year. 
Czech discovery: a substance that operates on the HIV virus "hard-working people" also 
A team of scientists Czech and German is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body. 
The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the viruses that have already developed an immunity to medicines. 
This is, in some cases, the upper hand on the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available. 
It is not possible to cure AIDS at present. 
We can prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the spread of HIV in the body. 
Their Consumption, however, a series of side effects. 
The repression of this increase is the development of so-called resistant viruses on which drugs have more effect. 
The work of experts of three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus. 
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus. 
The metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
This combination is blocking the development of the virus in a different way of all drugs used to date and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance. 
The work of researchers leads them to discover new substances "improved ", on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes on the proteins of the virus. 
The metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron atoms of hydrogen and carbon and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt. 
A virus traitor and resistant. 
The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus. 
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of the virus. 
If we stop the HIV protease, it will stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. 
In their work published in the scientific journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic link, which is then systematically amended. 
A little smaller but more reliable. 
The effectiveness of this series of substances on The HIV protease was tested in test tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV. 
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on medicines clinics, however it is not diminishing on versions resistant against which current drugs are often ineffective. 
The metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties as their biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to examine more to move towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína řezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences. 
Dispute around the budget. The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends 
The president of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Mirek Topolánek has described as "staggering" the budget ratified for the following year and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence. 
The prime minister has described the ODS of drastic verdict. 
He said take time to analyze. 
The spokesman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the idea of a Cabinet administrative supported by the ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party working more. 
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether ilprend to the Chamber of Deputies support on the minority who cares to combat the growing deficit, or if it is to remain in office with the assistance of the parliamentary left. 
Nečas has warned that the positions of the ODS and Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed. 
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, however, with the proposed amendments to the tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left. 
The House has increased the money for salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers. 
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion kronor. 
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, obeying the wishes of the government that a revised budget is a variant less bad than an interim budget. 
Disappointment and uselessness 
The Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of worthlessness, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will still consider the current situation. 
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in case of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation might be different. 
According to the Czech Television, Janota took meeting Monday with Prime Minister after its passage through government: 
He indicated at the same time that he wondered whether he would remain in office. 
His disappointment about the negotiations around the budget is the reason. 
If Fischer decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of ČSSD, which have imposed changes in the budget, have no place in the government. 
The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratifies the other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the law on services. 
Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in question. 
This is the case of the head of government Fischer and the government. 
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing harmful, said in a statement Topolánek text from the United States. 
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some departments profess TOP 09, who voted against the budget. 
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give his resignation to fight against the amount of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House." 
That said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of Democrats. 
I have not thought about it and once it will be on the agenda then I will dedicate, said since the House to journalists, the Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected government precisely by Democrats. 
The Prime Minister Fischer has soared in the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels. 
The ODS has backtracked at the request of the prime minister. 
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked Members Democrats to allow the vote on the budget. 
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, there is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered accusations from the President of the Party in the House or in the country in negotiating the budget. 
I have not noticed that my vote would have been lacking. 
I already knew when I renounced my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a bolchévisation of the House and destruction of all that was positive, reacted Topolánek in person. 
According to the new schedules ČD there will be fewer trains for the same charges. 
The Czech railways will remove or limit from 13 December some express trains or regional less responsible and will instead some others. 
The full coverage of transport will fall on the day of entry into force of the new schedules of two percent compared to today. 
Most of the charges will not change, including the basic rates and the reduced fare. 
For example, the inhabitants of the region in Ostrava who will have more connections to the capital, the railways will add a rowing pendolino. 
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava. 
There will also be less fast trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, the hotline Prague - Letohrad will be drastically reduced. 
At the regional level, the largest decline in transport in the region of Hradec Králové eight percent in total, Prague and its environs can celebrate an increase. 
Two night trains on the line Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice are also cancelled and the movement of some express trains on the line Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is reduced to only a few days in the week. 
Among the biggest changes, we can see the introduction of a new direct line of Milovice in Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice must change at Lysá nad Labem. 
It is the fifteenth line of suburban Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice. 
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at the main station in Prague (Praha Hlavní nádraží). 
The ČD will introduce more lines HC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave by intervals of two hours. 
Travellers can no longer take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December. 
The bill this year for regional railways: 200 million kroner. 
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Department of Transport and will pay the railways next year in all four billion kronor to address the losses visible, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate in height of nearly three billion. 
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive. 
The railways have newly signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was always a year. 
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains that they have not used a price increase of the vast majority of tickets. 
The changes will affect only tickets a day ČD Net and tickets at reduced prices eLiška. 
For travellers without reduction card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns. 
The price of eLiška will depend on the miles, whereas previously it was valid between cities in a region to choice and was a single tariff of 160 crowns. 
The Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released 
The rebels have kidnapped today 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some students of a primary school and their teachers. 
It is the AFP Agency who informed, but who spoke to the origin of 65 hostages only. 
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as a primary school teachers. 
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur. 
It is reported that about 19 rebels have used the hostages as human shields during a flight to the police. 
The local negotiators are trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages. 
According to the AFP Agency, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). 
According to the AFP Agency, police initially pursued the kidnappers following violence caused a settling of accounts between two family clans. 
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre during which 57 people were killed. 
Among the victims of the massacre of 23 November linked to the administration of Governor there avait30 journalists. 
The governor of this province in the southern Philippines was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan. 
The island of Mindanao also includes Muslim separatists assets. 
They have nevertheless renewed peace talks with the Philippine government Tuesday. 
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela 
The new Hollywood film of Clint Eastwood arrives in the U.S. in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official title Czech is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrae part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela. 
The role of the fighter against apartheid world-famous returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody. 
The second male role of The legendary champion South African rugby has been attributed to Matt Damon. 
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, returns of critics and the public are heard. 
Nelson Mandela 
Its full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 to Mvezu in South Africa. 
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit, in 1993 he then received the Nobel Peace Prize alongside de Klerk. 
He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. 
The film contains great expectations as it is presented at a time when on the one hand South Africa is in full preparations for the football World Cup, and secondly because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants of the black majority in power. 
According to the AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations towards the main roles where "pavanent" Hollywood stars. 
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, using his own words, proud of the film. 
I dreamt of this role for many years and I am well prepared. 
I have also repeatedly personally met Nelson Mandela to power - as they say - recover his energy, he said in the first official film in Los Angeles. 
I think it is a good thing if we had the opportunity to remember via the film personality and the message of Mandela. 
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but It is each individual he added. 
Wear the jersey of the national rugby team 
The film based on the history of the British writer John Carlin the title being freely translated. In the role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the room that gave his creation to the people depicted the South African defender of human rights during his presidency. 
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to pick up two racial groups of a population long divided and even that Nelson Mandela in 1995 it between wearing the jersey national team of South Africa on the lawn of the World Cup, that South Africa had won. 
To be shown on the lawn in jersey, which is regarded in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been widely cheered fourteen years ago mainly white audience and has been recognized by the white populations. 
Let us hope that the football championship will manage to unite people again in a single nation, "said the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995 the only" black "of the national team. 
It remains to be seen whether the South African tense situation will improve. 
The South African whites are however sceptical as recently said in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, rugby fan who has fled to Britain. 
The championship starts on 11 June 2010.

Jančura will sue for defamation against three prefects of ČSSD 
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will file today complaint for defamation against three prefects Social Democrats. 
And specifically against Michal Hašek region of southern Moravia, against Radko Martínka of Pardubice region and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesařík. 
Jančura indicated in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál. 
The complaint is linked to the attempt by the company to operate regional railways in some regions. 
All regions have eventually sign long-term contracts with the Czech railways. 
All three have attacked and say that the fine mouths, while there has only made an offer for what they wanted to themselves. 
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways which is not true because we know the price of Czech railways that were signed last week. 
Therefore we have to defend ourselves. 
It is in exchange for slander on society Student Agency, said Jančura in Radiožurnál. 
Similarly, he had evidence that no region has proceeded in accordance with European law. 
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission. 
Hašek considers that the complaint of Mr Jančura represents the result of its media spectacle that provides free publicity for his company and his person. 
I am of course prepared to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on other prefects to do the same. 
I assume that this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and using false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek 
Jančura has already informed last week that it will invest a few million kroner in an advertisement that indicate the steps unfavourable regions. 
He said to Radiožurnál that it halt the campaign after Christmas and that it intends to resume after the New Year. 
He said that the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense. 
Jančura began his campaign after the regions have agreed to entrust the Czech railways exploitation of rail links to an order of about 150 billion kronor, without issuing tender. 
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice. 
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions has even led to Jančura threats of a member of the ČSSD. 
The only threat was that if we do not stop, we could lose our licences bus. 
It is presented as a member of the ČSSD, I do not know who He is but I will not say his name, said Jančura today to Radiožurnál. 
Vaccination against pneumococcal will be free and voluntary 
The Vaccination against pneumococcal reverse old habits as early as January. 
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families. 
Some already, saying that a compulsory vaccination would be more effective. 
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peak. 
The Pharmaceutical Institute for vaccines already defines the maximum prices that will pay for health insurance. 
The experts also see clear in the process of vaccination. 
A new vaccination. 
Free vaccines for children of August. 
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated for free against pneumococcal. 
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated. 
If we began vaccination last year or earlier, we will have to pay yourself vaccinations. 
The first dose of vaccine should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child. 
Last year a quarter of families has voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal. 
Yet parents paid 1600 crowns or even more for a dose. 
The vaccination of younger requires four doses. 
Experts estimate that each year the health insurance spend 300 to 450 000 SEK in doses of vaccine. 
However, they save on medical care that unvaccinated children would require. 
So far the state was spending approximately 500 000 crowns per year for any vaccination of children. 
Vaccination repaid was introduced with the "Janota package ". 
The Pneumococcal are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning. 
According to surveys in hospitals, there has until 28 deaths of children under 10 years caused by pneumococcal infections. 
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced vaccination refunded. 
The Vaccination will be mandatory? 
There is advice on a possible obligation of vaccination in the future. 
From January, it must be resolved by insurance and optional. 
For example, the president of the association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a compulsory vaccination would be more positive. 
His association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcal. 
At an international conference to which our association has participated, experts were not really satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination. 
It is not ideal. 
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this. 
I think it is a direction that we must now follow said Kalovský. 
But the Department of Health does not change the process of vaccination against pneumococcus. 
We are definitely not for the moment, "said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň. 
The optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors. 
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of paediatricians, recognizes that a vaccine based on the volontariata its shortcomings. 
If all children were vaccinated, we could consider a reduction of renewals vaccinations "in the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional" said however Cabrnochová. 
The Experts predict that next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will vaccinate their infants. 
Vaccination against pneumococcal also marks a break from the fact that this is the first vaccination of children which is funded by the insurance and not the state. 
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, they save and on possible future medical care. 
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves 
This is linked to concerns of pediatricians practitioners, concerning the purchase of vaccines. 
The original intention was to purchase vaccines by insurance, doctors receiving the same way as other products of vaccine provided by the state. 
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance "deduct the amounts of health insurance." 
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance reimburse them. 
According to estimates, pediatricians will individually invest nearly 40 000 SEK per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum. 
It will be far from easy, according to Cabrnochová. 
Always them and we 
Islam can be French? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
Roger Bootle, Deloitte 
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well documented on an issue that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today. 
The last book by Mr Bowen presents a much broader and more ambitious. 
Good anthropologist, it does not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is happening in the country. 
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutions that provide now in France this queM. Bozen calls "spaces" for 5m-6m Muslims. 
He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on issues that concern them most. 
A Muslim should marry in a mosque or city hall (or both)? 
The evolution and The rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims? 
A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim? 
A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests to obtain a loan? 
These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media. 
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Muslim Arab born in Switzerland. 
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They do not push the debate until the end. 
Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam. 
The Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia that today, are a small part of Muslims in Europe. 
M Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and secularism of French could be compatible. 
But a compromise can be achieved only with the efforts of each camp. 
He wondered how the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism. 
According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make historic compromises with the secular republicanism. 
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values ". 
Islam can be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet." 
The view The world's darkest 
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other place on The planet. 
The ice is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere. 
Oil, gas, shipments and new fisheries sail in open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake. 
In "on a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, painted a natural history of the symbol of the far north, the polar bear. 
Who knows the history and complicated political of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were their evidence in hunting polar bears. 
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspiring 14 years who had to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true. 
The young cubs, captured while they swam alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a show celebrates 75 bears At the same time. 
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are still generally a millionth of the surface necessary for an adult in liberté. Climate is rarely mentioned: a polar bear living in Singapore became green because of algae that grew in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and is often on the threat posed by hunters on the survival of species. 
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killings continue in Greenland and Canada where hunters by helicopter and Inuit Indians in motoski use fusilsd "powerful assault to hunt their game. 
Ironically, it is in the most northerly waters of these two nations of hunting that ice will remain the longest. 
In his new book, "after the ice ", Alun Anderson, a former editor of new Scientist, offers a clear summary and frightening science of the Arctic and a fascinating glimpse of what may be the future there. 
Not that scientists have all the answers. 
Neither the atmosphéristes nor oceanographers cannot tell exactly the speed of change. 
It is not for lack of trying. 
Late nineteenth and early twentieth, travel pioneers of Fridtjof Nansen gave the initial information on the melting of the ice cap. 
The submarines in the Cold War were then mapped changes of relief sous-celle-ci. 
The Surveillance satellites and probes placed on icebergs are a great help, but most of the work is done by men hardened, camping in the cold. 
Mr Anderson looking at the world extraordinary and tiny system dependent on the Arctic ice, formed by the nets of brackish water pressure by freezing. 
But the bear mentioned above the wonders microscopic contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050. 
"In a few months, this may be our turn" 
The Marines, among the 6, 000 people who have laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington 
The first class De "Angello Robinson, 19, made a trip of seven hours by bus to file a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier that he had never met. 
For him and the other Marines who made the trip to Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina at Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was devoted to salute the men and women who, one day, were in their place. 
In a few months, where we will be sent, we will be in their place, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers. 
If this happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that is why I just trying to show respect. 
It was one of the 6, 000 volunteers to be gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans, in different sections of the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony. 
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company to Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others have decided to decorate several hundreds of graves in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony. 
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year the journey, stopping in different cities on their way to organize the commemorations in honour of the military and victims of terrorism. 
The Worcester have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America (Wreaths Across America), which aims to promote the event in all other states. 
This year, volunteers have placed more than 16 000 wreaths on the graves of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the cemetery Fayetteville National cemetery enArkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the memorial to the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation has given more than $150 000 to buy and carry the crowns. 
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a career military died. 
Although her husband is not buried at Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed. 
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said. 
It is like visiting a family tomb. 
Emmitouflée in several layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked between the lawns and hills tracts of the cemetery. 
The volunteers have chosen graves old, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited that new graves, organizers said. 
The mood was optimistic, while children played and couples were held by the hand, wearing the crowns of pine costs on the graves grey. 
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red butterfly knot on the top. 
Nearby, were silent on Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. 
The United Service Organizations gave 1, 000 crowns to decorate the section but the sour mood of current wars filled the area. 
Individuals without hiding, others prayed and families and friends supported in the cold air. 
Some read aloud the names engraved in stone while others looked to see small black and white information cards, stuck in the wetland for those whose tomb had not yet been completed. 
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on the grave of her son. 
It is part of Zanesfield, Ohio and had led eight hours to come to collect on the tomb of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, died in combat in July. 
No one should never forget thanks to what we are free... My son has paid for it, she said. 
"Long after I have disappeared, I want someone to remember him." 
A U.S. citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities 
The Cuban government has arrested an American citizen who disseminated mobile phones and laptop computers in the country, said the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs American. 
The citizen, which has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for clients such as the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
The consular authorities as well as the U. S. Interest Section in Havana trying to access the inmate who was arrested on 5 December. 
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested under the pretext of being "dangerous ". 
All the so-called revolutionary activities, including protests moderate and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest. 
The anti-government graffiti and speeches are regarded as serious crimes. 
Cuba has a community of bloggers increasingly large, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentator who writes often about how are husband and are followed and harassed by government agents. 
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards but authorisations have always been denied. 
The detention of an American citizen may increase tensions between the communist government of brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration that pursues a "soft" approach to improve relations with the island. 
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times, Friday evening. 
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government advance by concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. to reciprocate. 
Mobile phones and laptops are permitted to Cuba, although consumer goods and desired in a country or the average salary of an employee is $15 per month. 
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15 - minute conversation which corresponds to a day of salary. 
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited. 
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities. 
The Cubans wishing to connect often must provide their name to the government. 
Access to many Web sites is restricted. 
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare. 
Most of the few American imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U. S. Interests Section in Havana. 
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest. 
The arrest and detention are a big mistake. 
An activity that, in any other open society, would be permitted - distribute free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, "said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas program director of the group Human Rights Watch, which has recently published a report severe on freedoms in Cuba, called" new Castro, even Cuba ", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as leader of the country to replace Fidel, his older brother ill. 
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day. 
He said that any solution would probably be policy and that the Cuban government often causes a negative reaction in the United States, when the two countries begin to initiate a dialogue. 
The Pakistani authorities prevented a plot to send men in Afghanistan 
Saturday, the Pakistani authorities have identified an organization supposed to prepare a plot to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would disassemble an important network of recruiters of terrorists scouring the Internet in search of young men radicalized. 
Investigators said they hunted a personality insurgente hidden, known as Saifullah who invited these men in Pakistan after having discovered when one of them has commented approving the waves terrorists on the YouTube video site on the Internet. 
Arrived in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them to reach the remote area of the tribal belt of Pakistan, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps. 
But a representative of the secret service Pakistanis who has been informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince the al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the conspiracy of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network. 
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the mountains banned northeast become a haven of terrorism. 
They were seen as undercover agents. 
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the case. 
The representative of the authorities said that the men were determined and that they were always trying to obtain the necessary approvals for the entry into the camps al-Qaeda when they were arrested by the forces of Pakistani law. 
The case of these five men - who remain in Pakistan and who are interviewed by the FBI - insist on the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and perhaps more important, in the determination of people who trust. 
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret services have been a priority for infiltrate men in the al-Qaeda network. 
The organization Recruiters play the role of firewalls, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may be spies. 
According to analysts, the American potential recruits are studied closely by al-Qaeda. 
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their value propagandaire. 
However Evan Kohlmann, expert of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also do more attention in recent years in the choice of people they accept because the U.S. secret services have become experts in relation to their recruitment methods. 
If you try to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow its recruitment model that so many other people have already followed? Said Kohlmann. 
The model is increasingly on the Internet. 
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen called a "action" for the climate 
Tens of thousands of Protestants have walked the streets here Saturday, calling for greater action on the part of the negotiators working in the palace of Congress Bella Convention Center of the city. 
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100, 000 people, but 25 000 according to police estimates. 
This event was held relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists has lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown. 
On a day when little has happened during the discussions on climate sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying There is no planet B "and one in Spanish, saying" the Earth said she has enough ". 
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the top model and photographer Danish, Helena Christensen, who said that travel to the home of his mother, Peru, has opened our eyes to the problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that are already happening. " 
This is one of the reasons why I decided to join the great march - to get the word and to launch an appeal to leaders around the world to take the right decisions, ambitious and committed, she said. 
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it. 
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives. 
The police prevented the protestors from coming too close to the Bella Centre and said that it had arrested 19 people on the ground that they were wearing masks or that they were in possession of pocket knives. 
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of its involvement in discussions on climate, the activists who wore masks and black clothing, started several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some departments. 
They launched near buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "a few large explosions ". 
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon. 
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate. 
When asked if he thought that a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "in fact, this is something that I had no conscience. 
He then continued in Mandarin, saying "the event is important, I cannot hear what is happening outside ". 
He observed that the march could be harmful or helpful perspective. 
It shows the interest of the general public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said. 
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or that they are harmful to the freedom of others." 
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races 
The federal report last week on the results in mathematics has made a good news for public schools in Washington D. C. 
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that the Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1 - cm2) are much greater progress over the past two years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York. 
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (National evaluation of Progress of education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and white, both local and National. 
The results of white children of Grade 4 (CM1) to WashingtonD. C. have increased over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212. 
The gap of success has actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points. 
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling just one point, from 245 to 244. 
The result means of white has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough. 
The overview over a period of six years is not more encouraging. 
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in class of Grade 4 (CM1), when the first report NAEP District was published, was 60 points (262 to 202). 
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points. 
Last week, some advocates in the District have expressed concern that rising celebrated by the Director of group of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by white students who were already good elements. 
This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that promotes equality in education in the District. 
I do not jump for joy for one or two points earned, "said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), member of the Council of D. C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, Eaton elementary (elementary school). 
Often critical of the management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention. 
Really, you always see the positive signs and I respect that. 
But the fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges). 
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty. 
This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading System, schoolchildren classes of end of elementary and early college who have not incorporated the foundations of reading earlier in their school and who are lagging behind their peers. 
Every day, the mathematics curriculum for grades kindergarten (kindergarten to Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and real life experiences, as they have been put in place in the District by former responsible Clifford Janey, which must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week. 
I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these students below the level of the class, said Rhee. 
Others believe that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap. 
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of education at the University of California at Berkeley who studied the results of tests of cities. 
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington. 
Also this targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program. 
But the problem, of course, is that as the other superintendent of schools, it is trying to use the middle class whites and blacks. 
We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools. 
We must strengthen our schools districts so that all families, regardless of where they come from, be assured that their children can obtain an excellent public education. 
Janey, now superintendent of schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success étaitla duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with the Charter schools. 
It must obtain approximately 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of its teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a "starting point" for even an increase in the next contract.

Although this question is still largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic immigrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will enable them to enter the middle class. 
In fact, "Hispanic" second generation "on cinqpoursuit his studies at the Lycée - a notable success if one considers that both of their immigrant parents, most from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school. 
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way to future generations that will play an important role in the country. 
Researchers studying the wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed. 
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools. 
The Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as it to reach the university - in particular, if its efforts are regular and long-term. 
When you look at children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who has studied the Latin American students. 
We need to provide a support network for these children from kindergarten to high school. 
The federal program that has funded the visit universities of Graciela is a good example. 
Known as the gear up (prépares you), it provides more than $300 million per year to systems of local schools to organize preparation programs at the university that begin when students from low income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of years of high school. 
Since 1999, the programme has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U. S. Department of Education. 
The ministry of Iraqi oil obtained agreements with 10 foreign oil companies 
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auction that ended Saturday. 
The 10 agreements reached by the Ministry of Iraqi oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are poised to play a major role in the rehabilitation of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions. 
American companies are left with an interest in only two of 10 fields auctioned. 
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began Friday. 
The only one that had set an auction has lost. 
Two American companies have obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June. 
The low representation of American oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq has surprised analysts. 
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, are Asian and European companies that pave the way, "said Ruba Husari, editor of the forum Iraq Oil forum, a site of information on the Internet. 
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq. 
The concerns about security, corroborated by massive coordinated bombing, Tuesday, and political instability while American military troops withdraw have hampered the American oil companies, preventing them from entering with more force in Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve, say analysts. 
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, especially the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders. 
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to obtain contracts with the department. 
The most important American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong links with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and brought their technical advice, are left empty-handed. 
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. 
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, has more enchéri on contracts that other companies and is left with significant shareholdings in contracts for two main fields. 
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, spokesman of the Ministry of Oil. 
We are confident that Chinese society will be equal to its competitors and achieve its commitments in Iraq. 
The pre-selected companies to submit auctions have made offers which were then compared to the tariff per barrel that the department agreed to pay to motivate the production above current levels for each field. 
One of the main organizers of al-Qaeda would have been killed in Pakistan 
It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-qaeda's operations, this week, said Friday U. S. authorities of counter-intelligence. 
If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn. 
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the town of Miran Shah, in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region. 
Local authorities have said that the missiles had been fired by a pilotless aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside the lawless tribal border of Pakistan. 
They drove a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the secret services Pakistani civilians, speaking by telephone from Miran Shah. 
The representatives of the authority said that local activists suspects rushed to place and quickly confiscated what remained of "body completely shredded ". 
It was completely impossible to local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two representatives counter-terrorism officials have given evidence not specified that Somali was among the dead. 
Somali was described as one of the organizers military organizers who ran the al-Qaeda terrorist operations group outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. 
Its role was to organize conspiracies around the world, "said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistani territory. 
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe. 
It followed the strategic leaders of al-Qaeda and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks. 
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had progressed rapidly in the ranks of al-Qaida "s and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region. 
It is perhaps not known to the general public, but this does not diminish the threat It poses for us and our allies, "said the second official representative. 
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important figure of al-Qaeda or the second leader Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators. 
The pace of attacks carried out by CIA drones has declined since the summer, about six operations per month to two, according to the figures given by the Long War Journal, a Web site tempered by a non-profit group. 
This decline is perhaps due to improved tactics of terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while killing also ruthlessly suspected informants, says the site. 
The U.N. special envoy in Kabul withdrew 
The U.N. special envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of corruption extent during the presidential elections supported by the United Nations. 
The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration decided to send 30, 000 additional troops in Afghanistan. 
The U.N. envoy said that he supported this increase, but he expressed concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and that would force the other NATO governments to withdraw their forces. 
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, "said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
Our commitment must be long-term. 
The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the U.S. and other military powers to increase the number of international staff assisting the political transition in Afghanistan. 
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said. 
Eide said he did not resign but that it would respect the commitment that he made to his family in March, will spend two years in Kabul. 
He said that he wanted to prevent the United Nations. 
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement. 
I simply said that it was better to start looking for my replacement, said Eide. 
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival. 
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement. 
The representatives claim that the name of Staffan di Mistura was quoted; it is a citizen Italo-Suisse recently chaired an U.N. mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations. 
The reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September, President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to conceal evidence of massive electoral fraud. 
Eide denied these allegations but he said that the accusations of Galbraith - which has been thanked - "have damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of éléctions ". 
Eide said that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of American forces in Afghanistan. 
He also urged the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that it is attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence about how their money is spent. 
Eide has expressed his frustration about the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy hiring regulations of the United Nations hindered its ability to bring new talent. 
The rules of The United Nations are such that I could not recruit only one person since May, he said. 
It is catastrophic and it cannot last. 
Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions 
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions. 
Gates, speaking before a crowd of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has dédramatisé the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic. 
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. 
One of the things that weighs me most is that if I learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent in the war. 
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that target the military and political elite in Iran, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street. 
He said that "a set of incentives and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons "because" his people would suffer greatly "of these sanctions. 
Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the administration has joined the European leaders in warning that Iran will face consequences "probable" if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes. 
In the talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that it would resume dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor. 
The administration has prompted such an agreement, way to develop a confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations. 
Since then, Iran appears to be away from attempts to agreement - in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States. 
Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of Iran with some of the proposals of the international community to which they had in fact given their agreement in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join what they had not considered, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates. 
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions ". 
In a statement Thursday in New York, the mission of Iran to the United Nations has denounced what it calls "baseless allegations" of some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities of Iran and said that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to obtain a satisfactory solution in the long term ". 
Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning, Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before flying to the oil rich region of Kurdish to derencontrer troops to Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil. 
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly concerning the borders, property rights and the sharing of income. 
Gates has urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays of U.S. plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August. 
Gates also wishes to calm the anxiety of Kurds concerning the withdrawal pending. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within an unified Iraq ". 
We will not abandon you. " 
In China, a change of direction 
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster of propaganda lecturing, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "a baby, this is a grave in more ". 
They have learned the lesson that the authorities of the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never. 
We have already given all our time and energy to one child. 
There is no second, said Wang, 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months. 
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed "little emperors ", a crisis of the population threatens the country. 
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented. 
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent. 
This imbalance is even worse in the rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai. 
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning) said that the fertile couples to have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the aging Population and prevent a lack of manpower in the future ". 
Shanghai is on the verge of becoming "too old - but not as rich, however - that developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said. 
A gradual mitigation 
In the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial requirement introduced by the communist government. 
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay huge fines - up to three times their annual income - and suffer discrimination in the workplace. 
The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country to avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers for human rights have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy. 
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced pregnant women a second child to have abortions. 
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to a ratio boys - girls abnormally high. 
In recent years, the authorities of the population have gradually softened their position on the one-child policy. 
In 2004, they have given more exceptions to the rule - including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women are already children unique - and in 2007, they have softened much of their slogans hard. 
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Peking University, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child. 
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births. 
In no time, the posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization. 
The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slipping leaflets under their door. 
He has also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child. 
According to the head of family planning, the response has been disappointing. 
Disappointing response 
Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for records of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change. 
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, is always that four to five requests per month. 
Officials in Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be only about 165 000 - slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008. 
Feng Juying, Head of the Committee of family planning in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. 
They want to fill their first child, she said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, said that they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed. 
But like many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life assurance given by the government. 
Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible. 
The Western mistakenly see that the one-child policy is a problem of rights, "said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child. 
It is true, we stole the chance to have more than one child. 
But the problem is not only the law. 
It is money. 
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation. 
Wang, human resources, said she wanted a single child because it was an itself. "We were the centre of the family and had used that everyone cares." 
We do not have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. " 
Chen Zijian, 42 years and owner of a translation the said more bluntly. 
For couples working at two, middle class, which restrict the birth rate, he says, it must be selfish pourbien succeed. 
The People of 20 or 30 years have grown up seeing their parents fight in the early days of China capitalist and do not want to have themselves this way of life, "he says. 
Even one child asks a lot of time his parents, he says. 
A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life. 
Then there are the problems of space - "you must change your apartment" - and planning - "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write his CV for a place in the best mother tongue." 
Most of his friends are willing to this experience once, said Chen, but not two. 
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, "he says. 
We do not want to make too many sacrifices. 
The group of the United Nations has plans for reducing emissions 
The climate conference, sponsored by the United nations - characterized so far by postings disorganized and mutual recriminations - is back under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden in the coming years. 
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, stressed the remaining obstacles, as much as it has informed the path to take. 
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving next week in Copenhagen. 
Written by a special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to withstand global warming, short and long term. 
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate. 
It gives great flexibility in the process, said John Coequyt, Representative of the Sierra Club. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what has described the Secretary-General executive on climate change, Yvo de Boer, as "the full picture ". 
It shows the guidelines of a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, during the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 percent. 
Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050. 
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change - to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation. 
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week. 
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the negotiating climate has rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries. 
This change is the signal that the Obama administration becomes harder to China that the Bush administration has been two years ago. 
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and actions of major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not enough to ensure that the reductions could be verified by outside observers. 
Stern made his comments a hour after the Chinese deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei has said that the U.S. chief negotiator, lacked "common sense ", was" extremely irresponsible "for having said earlier in the week that the U.S. would not help financially China to combat global warming. 
With the future economic trajectories of major world powers involved, defects are both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies. 
The current battle is more the rescue of individual economies that the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States querellant on their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen countries most influential ignore scientific imperatives to act more boldly. 
Ricardo ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, stated that it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of the reduction of greenhouse gases, even if the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the major emitters accountable for their actions. 
It is really a game in which has developed a new economic hegemony, said ulate, which is also on the climate adviser for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International. 
Some of these countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they would continue to put pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to a minimum, a political agreement. 
The Alliance of Small Island States which brings together 43 members, has drafted a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday morning. 
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of unit climate of the European Commission, said that the action of small island states has "put political pressure on the political process complete ", in part by what they are now unified and they seek to emerging economies such as China and India, to act. 
The debates have become a matter of urgency, while delegates focused on the fact that they should solve most problems pending before the heads of government come to an agreement. 
High-level officials such as the Minister of the environment, Jairam Ramesh Indian and Chinese Vice-Minister descended from their plane and rushed into the building of the Bella Center to attend meetings in camera and conferences of information, in order to make claims that will be reviewed during the following week. 
The true image of the gathering - during which 13, 000 people entering and exiting the Palais des Congrès every day - activists guitar players are nocturnal entertainment mocking of countries that they betray and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by emails - constitutes a real challenge. 
The intensity is increasing: almost all key ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of governments will be in Copenhagen. 
We are entering the big boys, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of Conservation International. 
Lorries arrive. 
In Britain, the first train to 225 km/h will redefine the syndrome Monday 
A 5h13, Monday morning, a whistle percera night to signal the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed commuter train the country will reach 225 km / h, whereas it filera of Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes. 
Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first commuter train Javelin outside London. 
He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and will link the large conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland in London. 
The small holes lost become commuter cities successful business travel will be much less long and the passage of the plane and the car to the train will reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads. 
In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project. 
But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of dangers to the environment may curb high-speed lines. 
According to the Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to achieve for the government a feasibility report, will make his document to Lord Adonis on 30 December. 
It will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage for the high-speed network. 
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial. 
In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary. 
It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high-speed network more towards the north. 
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. 
The preferred options are put forward in a configuration in Y for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands. 
The line split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch from west Pennines àManchester and Scotland and another towards the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. 
A single line through Scotland. 
"It seems that this will be the best option of performance" said a professional rail. 
When this is completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes. 
The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to travel a hour now. 
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world. 
The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and can carry 1100 people. 
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham. 
A terminal that can accommodate 20, 000 passengers per hour would be necessary. 
Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high-speed network. 
The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility. 
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election. 
Even if it launches the machine, the network will be built part by part. 
The trains will initially be forced to drive out of high-speed lines on existing track north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland than three hours. 
This solution seems to be the best to ensure passage of trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution. 
Taxpayers repay the loan of £75, 000 for the Orangerie of Tory 
Alan Duncan, senior Tory member of parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year to reimburse the cost of an Orangerie that it has built in his home in his constituency. 
The head of the party that has been demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were "maintained ", has increased its loan of £75, 000 to build an extension in oak at his second home in Rutland. 
He had been authorized to pay the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer. 
The authorities have received complaints at the time and have not been interviewed by Sir Thomas Legg, who has a control of expenditure. Last night, Mr Duncan said that complaints could not be "clearer or more simple ". 
Mr Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, is the owner of a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton. 
The neighbouring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds. 
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and dining room, but the office of emoluments asserts that Mr. Duncan needed more space. 
Last year, he added a porch at home, describing in its plans as an orange. 
The neighbours describe it as a "porch for pleasure ". 
It has not been asked Mr Duncan to give an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation made by the Committee of Privileges and standards of the Commons, on its loan provisions. 
The Committee has cleared last month of any accusation of non-compliance with the rules, after an investigation into his expenses. 
In 2004, Mr Duncan has changed the legal certainty of borrowing of GBP 271.406 of his property in London at home in his constituency that he bought in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament. 
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately £1, 400 per month of interest loan until March last year. 
In April, its applications have increased by more than 1, 800 GBP per month. 
The interest rate on the loan RBS of Mr Duncan has not been changed at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to finance the borrowing of £75, 000. 
The interest rate standard variable RBS rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving since then. 
The last publication of Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May. 
Mr Duncan lost his position as head of the shadow cabinet in September, after a journalist in coverage was allegedly filmed saying that members of parliament were to survive "on budget" after the expenses scandal. 
"In fact, it is now national, you must live" on budget "and you are treated as" m... " 
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and I asked a small part, based on what was correct. 
And I could ask sacrément more, but I did not do. " 
The member of parliament, millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, has begun to explain its expenditure, in May, after it emerged that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden before agreeing with the fees office that this "could be considered excessive ". 
An activist has dug a hole in the form of £in the lawn of M Duncan to protest after it was revealed that he had requested 4, 000 GBP for three years. 
Asked about the increase in borrowing, last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for improvements capitals, approved by the fees office then by Legg." 
He added: "There is no problem of evasion or development or use of rules or anything. 
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc. 
This could not be clearer or more simple. " 
Faithful, come all see the Advent calendar of Brighton 
The cabs of Brighton beach have found a new way of promotion for the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar. 
Beyond, a group of church alternative that encourages the spiritual exploration by the creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each day of December, using as a theme, songs of Noel. 
The event began on 1 December, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5.30 pm to 6.30 p. m., every day, with blocks and wine served free of charge. 
The songs of Noel selected so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and the First Christmas ", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist. 
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant marketing TV of Hove, is a priest of the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond. 
He said: "We want religion is closer to the people in a society post-chrétienté. 
"As a church, why do we expect that people come in an old building strange? It seems to me that the church should get closer to the people and celebrate more exciting. 
"the idea of Advent calendar of the cabin of beach came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner. 
Brighton is a place if creative and vibrant and we try to experiment and to represent this through spirituality. " 
Late payments: anger prison guards, planned actions 
The prison guards unions have called Friday to the "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of year holidays bonuses and overtime which payment has been deferred to January for budgetary reasons. 
Fo-pénitentiaire (2nd union supervisors) asked the personnel who will not be in service to demonstrate Tuesday morning before prisons and the "block ", to" denounce the theft of their due. " 
The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union of the profession) calls to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilisation" as "shameful and unacceptable" non-payment in December of "overtime, night premium, Sundays and holidays" worked in October. 
And the first Union of supervisors, the Union autonomous federal prison (Ufap / Unsa), "appeal to the general mobilization (...) to raise the discontent and anger ". 
The direction of the prison administration and the Department of Justice explained that overtime have increased significantly in 2009 and have not all been budgeted, but ensure that the leftovers will be paid in January. 
The Chancellery said late in the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month. 
I know the efforts made by staff for the operation and the modernisation of our prison system, writing the Minister of Justice in this letter. 
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation born of a wrong assessment of the number of overtime does not recur in the future, "added Mrs Alliot-Marie. 
The pay of December will therefore be lean, except for the personal direction with the famous premiums of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap / Unsa, for whom "the budgetary constraints have good back ". 
It is a pure scandal, has outraged the union interregional fo of Marseille, in announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and meetings ". 
The staff will not work on Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, ditto for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne. 
At a time when increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our workforce, it is more than regrettable to dare to take money to staff, believes the CGT-pénitentiaire of Bordeaux. 
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some less badly off than others. 
But it is not, found the secretary general of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.

Absolutely, he was forced to concede before reply with humour by pointing to the string of pearl of the First Lady: "Who do you offered this? ". 
During this one-hour, casual atmosphere, with the famous moderator who has been a staunch support of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife were also remembered their favourite gifts as children. 
Barack Obama has mentioned a bicycle to ten speeds, but also a balloon basketball that his Kenyan father he has rarely seen offered him at Christmas. 
I remember the time I met my father came to see us for Christmas and where he gave me a ball basketball, the president said. 
Only much later in my life that I realized that it was he who gave me the ball. 
The First Lady was remembered for his side of his house of doll. 
I do not know how to organize a house so I had aligned all furniture against the wall, rather than around the chimney, but I loved this small house of dolls, said Michelle Obama.

For the franco-polonais filmmaker Roman Polanski franco-polonais called again Thursday in Los Angeles, California, western United States), the abandonment of charges against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a case of mores of more than 30 years. 
Chad Hummel, counsel for the director of "the Pianist ", has denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the Second District of California serious procedural errors at the time, in 1977. 
I called for the abandonment of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back ". 
According to him, the Judge Rittenband - died since - would have discussed, before making his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved the prison - which is a serious lack of procedure. 
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), the lips of the prosecutor, David Wells. 
But Mr Wells had finally declared late September have "lied" to the author of the documentary. 
If the court refuses to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel has demanded a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his arguments. 
The prosecution has reiterated the arguments already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment charges could be seriously considered as Roman Polanski would not be before the court. 
The filmmaker, aged 76, had fled the United States in 1978, before the sentencing, for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years. 
It has never set foot in the United States since. 
The deputy prosecutor in Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing ".

One of the three judges - who now have 90 days to make their decision - underlined "that there were other alternatives to the flight ". 
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request the abandonment of prosecutions against Roman Polanski. 
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, has also claimed, once again, the end of proceedings. 
Recalling that his client no longer supports to be harassed every rebound of the Polanski case, she added: "Nobody in this room can say that the procedure was fair. 
Thirty-two years is enough ". 
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on U. S. arrest warrant. 
After more than two months behind bars, he was under house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.

The head of orthopedic surgery and trauma of the Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel Monday in Los Angeles with the singer. 
The producer has vehemently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinic international Park Monceau in Paris. 
We were told that it was a massacre. 
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, "said Mr Camus. 
I have heard talk of a possible judicial proceedings, he said. 
Jean-Claude Camus said that Johnny Hallyday was "party much too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the surgeon Parisian ".

To support his approach, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP past in NC) which claims ownership of the mark UDF for being the first to file in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property. 
But Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to be deprived, has emerged from his silence to launch a formal notice to the Minister and MP, instructing them not to use the acronym and transmit the ownership of the mark, under penalty of prosecution. 
You have multiplied in recent days, the statements indicating that you would suggest to your political movement of + resume + the acronym UDF, writing the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez the modem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis centrist Alliance. 
You have also seen fit to follow up on your equipment activist and on the front page of your site, the name of this movement, the New centre +, the slogan + the UDF today +, also see the signatories of the letter. 
As you know, you have no right to the use of this acronym, explains the office of the UDF that remains the NC to withdraw "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF of any medium and (his) website ". 
It also calls on Mr Hervé de Charette "to convey the property of (the) marks its legitimate right holders ". 
If you do not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of members of the UDF, prevent the signatories. 
In their letter they specify that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a movement competitor, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP ". 
The New centre has therefore, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy). 
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its accession to the modem for three years and the creation of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. 
As for Mr Hervé de Charette, continues the bureau, "when he filed the mark ", it was" more adherent of the UDF for three years ", but the UMP. 
It benefits scandalously and fraudulently of the absence of filing of the acronym UDF to conduct on its behalf. 
This brutality is turning into crime, dénoncent-ils, before ironiser on the strategy of NC: "it seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for yourself to try to break the anonymity fraudulently taking a name which was not right ". 
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged for abuse of weakness 
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as in accuses the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness of the octogenarian to rob a portion of his fortune. 
The photographer 62 years, known for his photos of stars, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and a fine of €375, 000. 
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter will snap while taking the reins of the L'Oreal cosmetics empire. 
But the 15th criminal chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87 years old, should be carried out collectively by three doctors. 
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such a review, at least not in the conditions proposed by the prosecution of Nanterre during the investigation. 
Doctors Designated Friday will submit a report before 10 March 2010 by saying whether Liliane Bettencourt could find themselves in a state of weakness and what periods. 
I think it will. 
I will speak to him, said the of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman. 
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court. 
This is excellent news (...) the expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said. 
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist hands-on, which it accuses of having benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or tables of. 
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, as a long-standing friend. 
While the court should examine the admissibility of the action taken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have sometimes turned to unpacking family Friday. 
Thus, counsel Liliane Bettencourt reported three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said beware of the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers. 
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years. 
Françoise, I have never been able to speak to him since his marriage ". 
For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre again suggested that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially as a guardianship judge has refused in recent days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother. 
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and has no guardian. 
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney. 
The court has finally decided that it would decide once the trial will be held on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers. 
Revolution Managerial or end of economic intelligence? 
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence will have been in vain... 
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies vis-à-vis its employees, recalls the position vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to "values" determined from above as it was once, to impose the consumer products designed by the technicians of the plant. 
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the revolution has provided marketing strategies of conquest of markets to the... Although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected factors of preferences of clienteles return regularly! 
A demobilization of employees can lead to A deadly demoralisation. 
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects in particular. 
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including of R D and, more importantly, the economic intelligence. 
Indeed, the IE "requires of all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; it requires on the part of employees a commitment that the revenue management authoritarian bedevil completely. 
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put the staff at the centre of the concerns of the company as the client. 
The usefulness any opinion surveys internal 
The internal opinion surveys as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its salariés- will encourage this revolution in managerial practices? 
Unfortunately, I fear not. 
- Firstly because I could see that, faced with a new situation, any structure is finally, after many detours, priority... What it has always done.! 
- Secondly, because authoritarianism - a pathologies of pouvoir- increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures. 
- Finally, because most of the leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour. 
From the major engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology. 
They adopt, by intellectual comfort, the old theory Behavioriste, cranked up recently by the "neuroscience" American and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes and the media. 
Thus, suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) the commitment of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro. Fr conforte-t-elle leaders in a mechanistic governance posture, unsuited to today's world. 
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization 
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, to adopt a finalist vision of human behaviour. 
It is to integrate, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clear as a means of achieving a portion of their dreams, their ambitions, their projects. 
Currently, only studies from the analysis motifonctionnelle adopt this design of the motivations of employees. 
These studies have shown that they consider their company based on a predetermined doxa which allows them through their image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life projects. 
Through the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilization, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and submit their management of human resources "to the place ". 
They create a breeding ground for joint development of a robust and effective economic intelligence. 
Oslo speech: the "just war" is right to praise Obama 
The American right has welcomed Friday speech the eve in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States. 
The Conservatives, who had brocardé the award to Mr Obama on 9 October, applauded this time the presidential speech, like Sarah Palin, former candidate for the vice-presidency in the 2008 elections. 
I liked what he said, "said Mrs Palin, égérie of the right wing of the Republican Party daily, USA Today, adding she herself addressed the theme of war" sometimes necessary "in his memoirs that have just been published. 
The war is obviously the last thing in my opinion that Americans want to do, but it is necessary. 
We must stop these terrorists everything out there, she said. 
Mr Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked Thursday to Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30, 000 additional troops in Afghanistan nine days earlier. 
Another opponent of Mr Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done in Oslo "a very good job ". 
I found that the speech was really very well, welcomed the former speaker of the House of Representatives, which has particularly appreciated the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential. 
By some side, I found this quite historic, "said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio program" the takeaway ". 
The former elected, regarded by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not put a price of peace if the use of force did not exist ". 
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush converted columnist at the Washington Post, Mr. Obama delivered "a very American ". 
In addition to appear in "citizen of the world" as "it always does," he spoke as an American president, "reminding Europeans" that they live in a bubble of security that they have not created and that they do little to preserve it, "said Mr Gerson. 
Among the few right to not be convinced, a hawk in the Bush era, the former ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, called the speech "dull, ampoulé and without inspiration" on the site National Review Online. 
Has the left of the president, the Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force. 
When envelope the war in the concept of justice, can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned. 
The centre-left press remained however commendation to the president. 
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel prize was awarded prematurely to Mr Obama, described his speech "blockbuster" even for a speaker known for his talent. 
The speech Oslo "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression ", has ignited the Daily Californian. 
Mr Obama "delivered the speech that he was," said the New York Times, saying "both dark and inspiring ". 
Road: three marathons for an agreement that saves the supplies of Christmas 
After three sessions of négociations-marathon, the road sector unions and employers' organisation TLF, only to be stayed until the end, arrived Friday evening to an agreement that puts an end to the strike and the threat to supplies of Christmas. 
At the meeting of signatures Friday evening, the secretary of state for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" of this agreement, after several rounds of negotiations, launched on Wednesday morning. 
After a second night of discussions the negotiators were left in the early morning Friday, with the hope of signing quickly in late morning the text of agreement. 
Even if three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door. 
But it took more than six hours of a meeting began at 11.00 for everyone to agree and that the text is signed. 
The conflict "would have been very damaging for business" and "it was feared that it will disrupt the Christmas years," said Mr Bussereau. 
The text provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in road transport local and regional), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport). 
In hourly rate, for the bas-salaires, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06. 
It is not much, but it is very far, explained Patrice Clos (FO). 
It will give the order to our activists that there is no blockages, no blockade of centres of supplies. 
But we can always have some recalcitrant who are not happy, he added. 
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good agreement ", even if it was" difficult to concede the increases on high salaries given the international competition ". 
According to him, the increases will be of the order of EUR 170 monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest. 
It is the agreement of common sense and respect of employees, "said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed" a historic agreement ". 
Richard Jaubert (CGT) has mentioned "an acceptable compromise ". 
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel expenses of 3%, and the holding of general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will address the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective agreement. 
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' contributions" has been the subject of a government amendment to draft amending finance for 2009, voted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly. 
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical ". 
The signing of TLF allows that the agreement applies initially businesses adherent to this organization, and in a second time, the entire profession, in the case of an extension by the Minister of Labour. 
It will be "as soon as possible," assured Mr Bussereau. 
The opposition of employers' organisations can only delay the process. 
The FNTR denounced a "fool's bargain ", because the EUR 100 million" had already been promised the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax ". 
The Secretary of state for transport has obliged us to negotiate in the urgency, not in conclusion d? A shared analysis, but not to thwart the turkey eaters of the next eve, deplored the Unostra. 
For the Otre, the agreement risk "digging the grave d? A very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months ". 
RER A: disruption this weekend, unions unhappy with proposals of the RATP 
The disturbances on the RER a, the largest urban transit line of France, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting Friday at the 2nd day of strike between unions and management of the RATP left on their hunger on their demand for premium. 
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend of purchases before Christmas, there will be no trains between 10 a. m., a train on two on the central portion (between Defence and Nation) and a train on four outside the central section. 
The interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change trains. 
The Galeries Lafayette, who expect 200, 000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP should make efforts to serve the department stores ". 
The RER A crosses from west to east The Paris conurbation. 
The RATP short of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée. 
Friday, about a train on two was circulated at peak hours, and almost no rowing in off-peak hours, as planned. 
As Thursday, there has been no crowds on the docks, Franciliens organized. 
And in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially because of the absence of school students. 
Has Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer of 29 years, explained to be lifted "a hour and A half earlier, so be sure to arrive on time ". 
The station Saint-Lazare has not been saturation, indicated the SNCF, which had provided a framework of agents and security forces. 
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left the station Saint-Lazare to join the subways. 
New general assemblies of strikers will be held Saturday and Sunday, which will review the results, deemed "meagre" by the unions, a meeting with management on Friday afternoon. 
The director of RSP proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for the RER an on all aspects, working time, career path etc. 
This is not what the drivers, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South). 
The RATP puts even its proposals for premium in brackets, has outraged the CGT, stressing that the direction "was not kaput to solve a problem while among road and the SNCF is done ". 
A new meeting is planned Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of exercise of the profession," said the RATP. 
What has also say the unions that the company "scoffed users over the weekend ". 
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded a committee of establishment at headquarters in Paris. 
It was then that the direction, which refused until then any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in a spirit of appeasement" the meeting. 
The conflict threatens to widen the RER B Tuesday, after the filing of a notice by Unsa and Independents. 
The trade unions demand a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to EUR 150 and EUR 30 variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line the million daily passengers. 
Drivers of RER, all in the second part of career, affect 2.200 to 2.700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for the shifts, Sundays and holidays. 
The Turkish justice dissolved the pro-Kurdish party, decision with serious consequences 
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul. 
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is to reach out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict. 
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the press the president of the court Hasim Kiliç, at the end of four days of deliberations. 
The decision was taken unanimously of 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to deliver the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of party officials, including its president Ahmet Türk and member Aysel Tugluk, are banned from politics for five years. 
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Mrs Tugluk and confiscation by the Treasury of the party. 
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (550). 
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without label. 
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP to obey "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many countries. 
Many observers believe that the DTP is the showcase legal policy of PKK rebels. 
The party maintains, however, that it was "no organic links" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with him. 
The verdict of the Court comes at a time when the government is to reach out to the Kurdish community in proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, to try to shrink the support of the PKK and put an end to the conflict. 
The leaders of the DTP had said that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks. 
After the announcement of justice, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeast populated majority of Kurds. 
The security forces fired tear gas and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with slingshots. 
A hundred people demonstrated also in Istanbul. 
After the verdict, Mr Türk said that the decision of Justice would "deepen the despair." 
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, Ed) by banning a party, he said to the press. 
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision. 
We are opposed in principle to the closure of parties. 
This resolves nothing, "said Minister of Energy Taner Yildiz. 
This decision is a total torpedoing of democratic openness launched by the government, "said political analyst Ahmet Insel. 
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added. 
On Thursday, the PKK has claimed an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey, one of the most deadly in recent months. 
The new "Silicon-valley" 
For a long time she had the reputation of city secret, prohibited to Western visitors. 
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the Soviet regime, a place of research secret weapons, under strict supervision. 
Today with its 216 000 inhabitants to 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the "Silicon Valley" Soviet. 
Important places of production and of micro- and nanoelectronics are located. 
Since September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, place of science francfortois - with academic institutions and companies in the centre of innovations in Frankfurt (FIZ). 
There were meetings reciprocal last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "protocol of close collaboration ". 
The signatories were the Deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz section chief project for Frankfurt. 
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose strong point is scientific research, will Zelenograd for a seminar. 
Scientific exchange 
It is a scientific exchange sustainable. 
But also of economic relations. 
It will enable companies of FIZ to enter the Russian market in full expansion. 
Unlike the Russian scientific societies seeking contracts in Germany. 
Zelenograd is the seat of research institutes and companies Soviet famous. 
There is the Institute of Electrical Engineering from Moscow, the big firms Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika. 
The municipality was founded in 1958 as "socialist planned city" for research. 
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City ") gets its name from forested hills in the heart of which research centres are located. 
The project S21: a brake for Stuttgart 
We Cannot place high enough the magnitude of the project Stuttgart 21. 
To its supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe ". 
If you want. S21, it is more than the burial of a railway station, more than a massive construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, in a chaos despairing of yards for a decade. 
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s. 
The stations head of line, with routes which ended in town, had a reputation at the time to be the relics of the technical transport of the 19th century that were effect of brake shoe modern rail traffic because it was once a lot of time to get the locomotives back to the. 
Arrival, stopping short, departure - that is what needs to be done. 
That is why the head of line must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And Stuttgart also: a station of passage of trains, which is about halfway on the trans-European rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava where the slogan "heart of Europe ". 
The project S21 will really start, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality. 
Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant. 
Indeed, the head of line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern trains, reversible with railcars and voiture-pilote at both ends. 
However, it is now launching the achievement of Stuttgart 21 alongside the new line inter-city towards Ulm. 
The regional and communal policies prevailed. 
The railway company is in part because it is the taxpayer who paid the cost of the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company. 
From the point of view planning this project is relatively well justified. 
An urban space which - according to the charts planners generated by computer - will be very green. 
For the system of rail transport the S21 is harmful. 
The station and enlargement of the section are designed for a trafficking which assigned - and this is typical of the 1980s - an enormous growth. 
At the time there was not yet competition from cheap flights. 
The policy of modern traffic should first focus on strengthening the traffic of goods transport by rail is much more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road. 
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains. 
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the draft of the souabe. 
It is the official figure. 
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic. 
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will for other junction and congestion in the network. 
The list of the Department of Transportation mentions in all 60 major projects. 
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section across the Rhine Valley of 180 kilometres. 
Since 1987 the line is built in slow motion. 
It would be really urgent support here to build on the fungus. 
But the project S21 had the effect of brake shoe. 
The route of the Rhine Valley is becoming the bottleneck of international freight traffic, and this in the heart of Europe. 
The government is considering the judgment on the airport 
The regional parliament in Wiesbaden, the Land government has raised the possibility of appeal to the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flights. 
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the coalition CDU / FDP had entrusted experts to examine the legal point of view the ruling by the Administrative Court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages. 
The Tribunal of Kassel was justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the case or the construction of the runway aterrissage northwest of Frankfurt airport was realized. 
The approval of attérir for 17 aircraft between 11 pm and 5 in the morning, as envisaged by the government of the Land, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against air pollution at night. 
The coalition must have decided on 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgment. 
The opposition criticism this deadline and tries to put pressure on the government representative for celui-cirenonce to appeal to the federal Administrative court in Leipzig. 
The head of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and which was to ban night flights. Otherwise, it will be condidéré as a total failure to a word. 
It is damn hard to be allowed to keep its word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir in referring to the slogan éléctoral FDP "We want our promises ". 
The Minister Dieter Posch denies the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel who claims that the Land government tries to authorize still night flights using "avocasserie and roublardises ". 
It takes time to conduct a legal review. 
The coalition does not take a decision on the basis of a "rapid" first impression. 
The decision is legally reliable, said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of its fraction on the prohibition of night flights is completely érronée. 
US banks repay the aid 
The big American banks, very affected by the crisis, shedding their ties vis-à-vis the state. 
The Bank of America announced Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than 30 billion euros), corresponding to the aid granted under the rescue plan Tarp. 
The chain of American television CNBC reported in a story that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received. 
The Banking institutions seeking to get rid of restrictions, which accompanied the acceptance of money, such as limiting bonuses awarded to leader as the Regulation of higher costs. 
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by The sale of securities to investors who reported $19 billion of fresh money. 
The remainder comes from the coffers of the bank that are met through the sale of several branches of other sectors. 
On Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis the Director General of the Bank of America held specifically to thank American taxpayers: the injection of capital has significantly helped to overcome a difficult period. 
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil. 
The Citigroup also plans to get money on financial markets to free themselves from the guardianship of the state. 
The U. S. bank could launch as early as Thursday a capital increase of $20 billion, reported the chain CNBC citing the banking community. 
The spokesman of Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information. 
In June the banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid the public funds they had received. 
Election Accelerated 
Finally it is still spent more quickly than expected. 
Barely two weeks after the dismissal of the current taking the post of chief writer Nikolaus Brender by the board of directors of the German ZDF, the successor is appointed. 
The committee wanted to vote yesterday evening to make the appointment. 
Peter Frey who heads the drafting of ZDF was the odds-on favorite. 
The chain has not wished to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure. 
However, it appears that there was also the desire not to further undermine the steward of the ZDF Markus Schächter in case the proposal would not be accepted by the Council of Administration. 
Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14. 
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition. 
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed to the Council of Administration to extend for five years the contract of Nikolaus Brender but this had been rejected. 
Only 7 Council members had expressed support for the continuation of Brender and 7 others had voted against. The dismissal by vote of Brender represented a failure although predictable for Schächter. 
Indeed, the CDU majority in the Council of Administration had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his position. 
It is Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse who had organized a league against the editor. 
He had denied that the contract of esteemed writer in chief is extended, citing the fact that the rate of listening to the news of the ZDF had fallen under Brender. 
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denouncing the growing political influence on ZDF. 
At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and who felt that the action of Koch was unconstitutional. 
But it will have achieved nothing. 
Peter Frey: Who is it? 
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen. 
He studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish). 
He then worked in radio body Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) and the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau (national). 
In 1983 he became editor in the ZDF first the news magazine "heute-journal" (newspaper today). 
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the assistant editor of the time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was head and presenter of "Morgenmagazins" (emission information presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the policy of the ZDF and head of the Berlin. 
After the disgrace of Brender, which had just been elected journalist of the year by the trade magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens have announced that they will launch a constitutional complaint 
The enemy of Koch to the Council of Administration, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the intergovernmental Treaty of ZDF so that the proposals of the intendant staff cannot be blocked by a political majority biased. 
However, Beck has no plans to seek the withdrawal of political figures who are members of committees overseeing the ZDF. 
Peter Frey, the likely successor to Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the Council of Administration in criticizing the Commission vehemently in its decision to dismiss Brender. 
This evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose for the position of editor without losing face, as well as the Council of Administration could elect without the soupconne to place as a partisan politics. 
In the representations arithmetic of parties, Frey is classified liberal left. 
Large Cleaning in university studies 
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike the ministers of education and cultural affairs of the Länder decide to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between ministers and delegates to the conference of Presidents, an agreement has been developed stipulating that the working conditions of students Bachelor or Master should be improved. 
In the future, students should be able to overcome their studies. 
They are particularly accordpour lighten the burden of reviews: a single review should close the module of study chosen. 
In addition, the workload will be reconsidée to ensure "realistic and acceptable ". 
The political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad. 
The Länder have also committed to organise common structural requirements more flexible for The channels of Bachelor and Master. 
At the regional level, there should be no different from land to another. 
Less reviews 
Since the beginning of student protests last June, the Minister of Education of the Länder and the university rectors have repeatedly to mouth the buzzword: "étudiabilité ". 
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a practical meaning. 
The accreditation council decided to significantly reduce the number of some reviews: "Each module should normally be concluded by a single review," in a document of 30 pages on future conditions for admission to university cycles. 
Reinhold Grimm, president of the Board of accreditation said that by sharply reducing the burden of reviews should be able to stop the slippage, which interfered considerably to the étudiabilité. 
The "étudiabilité" should also be, in the future, the decisive criterion of the organization of studies. 
The modules like the substance must be examined carefully to see if we cannot avoid this smothering sensation that you feel sometimes in the choice of courses. 
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception. 
Students should "have the opportunity and the flexibility to allow and encourage the personal initiative ". 
The new regulation will access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles. 
These cycles must be "réaccrédités" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only by 2015 that all cycles have been reviewed. 
There are 10 relevant accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on accreditation Board created by the Länder. 
In October, the Ministers of Education had exerted some pressure on the Länder to weigh on the agencies so that the programmes are not too loaded and the regime of not too strict. 
In some Länder, universities and colleges specialized have already agreed with their regional departments to take the appropriate measures. 
The Rhineland-Palatinate is so far the only Land to have agreed to grant more resources to the development of the Bologna process. 
With these funds, universities must organize programmes tutorielset strengthen educational guidance offices and the offices of examinations and the service of international relations 
The Länder and universities provide for a budget of EUR 10 million. 
In early 2010, the government wishes to submit to Parliament an amendment to the law on higher education institutions. 
Following this there will be no more make one consideration to complete his studies. 
The organization of studies should be more flexible, more must be able to guarantee the recognition of transcripts of other institutions of higher education and access to the Master must be simplified. 
By the end of next year, "étudiabilité" of all graduate will be examined. 
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition have again discussed the question of study conditions in the country. 
The décisionsont been appreciated but critics were heard. 
The Federal President of the student union Socialist has indicated that he would like the organization of educational policy does not happen in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and presidents of universities. 
At the latest after the strike educational, students as people concerned should be able to speak a little. 
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of delegates to the Conference of Presidents (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of education of the Länder with which the HRK is working on a project of common reform. 
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It calls the right and the opportunity for each bachelor graduate to enroll in a cycle of Master. 
Andreas Keller steering committee member of the GEW also requested that the Länder ensure students bachelor today, tomorrow there will be enough places for studies in Master and conditions of studies as good as possible. 
The Länder must hire more lecturers. 
By contrast, the Ministers of Education have not raised the possibility to ease access to the master. 
More than a footnote on Herta Müller 
It is by these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that begins a work of the poet Werner Söllner, in which he dealt with in snippets of disturbing sentences, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany who won freedom but lost at the same time its linguistic territory. 
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and, subsequently, director of collection in a publishing house for youth before moving to Frankfurt am Main. 
Söllner received various literary prizes; in 1993 he was the highly coveted chair of poetry of Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he is director of the forum of literature of Hesse in the house of artist Mousonturm in Frankfurt. 
He has done a lot of him in circles not literary last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, whose theme was "the German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate ". 
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his fellow writers germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had worked as an informant for the Securitate police policy. 
Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants. 
The trials of enrolment insidiously in 1971. 
I am, therefore, concludes Söllner "someone who has not sufficiently stood auxessais intimidation of the Securitate." 
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (Im Walter). 
Almost simultaneously with the honoration Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, in a case which clearly shows the pitfalls and baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage. 
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim. 
In his own Securitate file, Im Walter played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of Im Walter who had interceded In his favour. 
"He had been drawn from all difficult situations at the time," according to Markel. 
Markel has felt the need moralde make this comment. 
The form in which Söllner made his statement and before the public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident its collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact, not so surprising. 
Germany is a reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal "Die Zeit ", having read the 914 pages of his own record. 
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and sometimes have guessed what real names were hiding last names borrowing Sorin, Voicu and Walter. 
Unlike Germany where the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused. 
A systematic clarification was constantly frustrated and slowed in past years. 
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work with the assimilation of Archives of the Securitate (CNSAS) but the return of files rather dragged since. 
Since 2005 there is a law that defines the management of archives. 
The influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by an interview with a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, expressed very dismissive of the winner. 
She had a psychosis, and ultimately it had questioned only once. 
The infamy of power felt able to speak here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression. 
Certainly, many questions are associated with the case Söllner as happens so often in a context of guilt hidden. 
Why now? Which has been despoiled? The weighted response from listeners, the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge that by accusations and a sense of shame. 
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote. 
In the Champions League 
We had the impression that a representative arrived here, fired four pins from any right of a Christmas party cool, on which the manufacturer of sports had spread its goods when the new coach VfB Christian Gross monta at midnight quarter in a Mercedes C Class, that he had just called, a plastic bag orange the hand. 
The man, whose skull bald drew attention, was driving in the city that was still foreign. 
Otherwise our quinquagénaire could have taken the wheel - he had not been drinking alcohol and it was not drunk with happiness. 
He had spent a pleasant evening but tomorrow it should return to work. 
It is now that it would begin. 
The words of Switzerland that had to hire three days earlier were clear: "we have reached the eighth of final ", that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by success. This will be a brutal struggle not to fall ". 
The "big job" we expected Sunday. 
Here, it is to repeat in Mainz the results of the Champions League. 
And it will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three goals expeditious of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11). 
Drawing of lots 
The eighth final of the Champions League (match go 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / return match 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18 December in Nyon. 
The joy of the inauguration of the successor of fulminant Babbel was moderate. 
And the joy was not only moderate who had brought luck, who had sent to professionals in Stuttgart destabilized, motivated and fun to play. 
I see the players and I told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised to be more courageous, explained the "plumber souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded if bienmais which was more effects with the trainer Babbel. 
It triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - supporter of Babbel - "in football when there is a new impetus it happens sometimes things that we would never have thought possible ". 
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" found by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "it is someone who takes action and requires discipline. 
That is what we need in the current situation ". 
But apparently Babbel had failed. 
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet turned the corner, warned the manager Horst Heldt 
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs of tenacity. 
Just As Gross, the players and the manager tightlipped about overstate the victory against a defence completely outdated and weakened guests Romanians. 
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with 0:4, objecta Khedira. 
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved the goals of the season but they had others who were still far away. 
We have not yet past the difficult. 
That Heldt the day of its 40th anniversary does not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first victory at home for three months, the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann did rebound just before the start of the match. 
There are decisions that others take and not Jens, confounded Heldt, in response to the criticism of Lehmann. 
He had accused the direction of weakness of style and said that it had decided to change of coach under pressure from fans pubertaires. 
Lehmann had seen also as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousiele fact that his day of free after the matches had been deleted. 
The statements of Lehmann were "marked by a pure selfishness" broke Heldt and announced consequences for the goalkeeper. 
They were more likely to become friends for life these two quadragénaires. 
In any cast, they agreed to everything else, that is to say that without the work of the group by the coach replaced, the strong representation and combative would not have been possible. 
Babbel and his assistants were "for a large share in the success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in choir - and even the plastic bag obliged. 
World championship heavy 
Combat Hot in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly verbally and gestuellement the world champion Vitali Klitschko. 
But after 12 rounds difficult Ukrainian defended his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles from the version of the federation. 
The unanimity of judges it imposed on points. 
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retained his title of world champion of heavy goods vehicles. 
The federation WBC announced that in the Saturday night the champion of 38 years had won a victory points to the unaminité judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10). 
For the third time Klitschko defends with honour its title since his comeback on stage in October 2008. 
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of WBO federations and WBC. 
Unfortunately it has not passed the long-awaited KB. 
Klitschko, out 39 times winner in 41 professional fights, say twice its defeat because of injuries. 
The challenger Johnson has to accept its first defeat in 24 fight. 
In the arena of Berne, before 17, 000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from its 2.02 metres, by its against left. 
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller, which before the duel, announced the end of the era Klitschko, managed to avoid the blows of champion, empéchant Klitschko to bring into play its against right-wing dangeureuse. 
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has tried to move the rounds. 
Although he continued to cause Klitschko in words and deeds its assault reached very rarely the champion. 
It is the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, have exceeded with Klitschko distance of twelve rounds. 
The challenger had done a lot of noise in the capital Switzerland before the fight. 
It insulta Klitschko the "dirty" zombie "is not really capable ". 
During the weighing Friday, the champion has not been able to prevent cause Johnson by removing his sunglasses nose "to see his eyes ". 
Fourth victory since the comeback of Klitschko. 
Klitschko imposed again at its fourth combat since his comeback on 11 October 2008 
After a pause of almost four years, he had beaten at the time the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "its" WBC belt that he had previously abandoned without a struggle. 
This year, defending his title of champion, he won the battle against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola us. 
"I just took a blow in this fight and am in perfect form" had said Klitschko to explain his rapid return on the ring. 
His rève is to try to bring in the family the four most important titles. 
His brother Wladimir is champion of WBO federations and IBF federations. 
But it is the British David Hague who, having détroné the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 metres - in November, is the WBA belt. 
This summer, Hague had cancelled a game against Vitali Klitschko which was to be held in September. 
It would appear that his promotion company plans to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London. 
The case Kunduz 
Frontal attack opposition: the head of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the case Kunduz. 
The SPD and The Left party (Die Linke) asked The Chancellor explanations. 
Hamburg / Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the air attack in Kunduz, the opposition has criticized the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) délibérémentdissimulé some facts. 
The Minister has intentionally "made an untruth" on the deadly strike two tankers last September, said the head of the parliamentary Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the broadcast of information chain ARD "Tagesschau" (the Journal of 20h). 
Clearly, this means that he lied. 
The order to kill has been given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF). 
It is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said. 
Last Friday, according to new revelations of the media, the objective of lafrappe was in reality, not to destroy the stolen trucks, but was intended to eliminate two important Taliban leaders. 
According to the investigation report of NATO, 142 people were killed or injured in the U.S. air strike which was launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz. 
The Greens, the SPD and the Left have requested Saturday Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), to decide as soon as possible before the federal parliament and reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident. 
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Mrs Angela Merkel must say clearly whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the government's Afghan policy fédéralet if the Chancery, the army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy. 
The government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms. 
The Chancery has in no way influenced the interventions of the army in Afghanistan, he said. 
Saturday, voices were increasingly strong to express doutesquant the real reasons the removal of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as had been presented by the department. 
According to the information of the newspaper SPIEGEL, the information they had handed over to Guttenberg concerning the attack tankers were both correct and complete. 
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the report of NATO and hid the Minister some details troublesome. 
In the entourage of two senior officials suggests that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of Colonel Klein and a report of the military police. 
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung "reports that Wichert would have meanwhile requested in a letter a clarification of the facts. 
So far, it has not received a response 
Saturday, the department did not wish to comment on these accusations and referred to the Committee of Inquiry of the federal parliament which would be the next Wednesday to dapporter light on the facts in question. 
The worlds of dream 
Some see, awake, images and hear voices that nobody else sees or hears. 
It is not only among the mental patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between fantasy and reality blur. 
As these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is going very well. 
When we are lying in our rooms clouded, we can do without hindrance to the dreams and wildest fantasies. 
However, awake, experienced dream, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly reputation in our western world to be crazy or drugged, or at least to be an original. 
Such images and voices do not appear in the mental patients or under the influence of drugs. 
It is our imagination that is at stake: It is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to merge. 
A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, may be in various forms, in the best case it is called visions, at worst madness. 
But even if the trigger and the effect differ, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the prophet of New Age Carlos Castaneda, the latter of chamanes, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to process very similar. 
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmettrices brain - first and foremost the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achétylcholine - breaks down and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted. 
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis. 
The force of attraction land has more power on the person. 
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and the dream. 
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great similarity between madness and the dream," Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who composed ". 
We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic strip. 
His body is in two dimensions to the garish colours. 
The attraction land has more power over him, to the ceiling. 
He feels a coup. 
Behind him creatures of devil ailées, grimaçantes, mouth bloodied, showing the teeth. 
They continue, give him kicking with heavy boots, the cast against the walls, he feels pain throughout the body. 
The thundering voice, nasty, howl, leaving the walls and radio. 
It can no longer bear those voices who insult and humiliate. 
Henning T. pulled two cables of its stereo, in fact a loop and attached to a hook attached to the ceiling. 
It is on a baffle and happens the loop around the neck. 
He jumps. 
The loop stands out. 
That you serve as a lesson, shout the voice in a chorus to extract the eardrum. "in a clinic and fais-toi treat!" 
Today Henning T. 40 years ago, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years. 
It was triggered by LSD. 
The diagnosis: psychosis schizo-affective, paranoid, furthermore it is maniaco-dépressif, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia. 
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. 
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair. 
The illusions are a cruel reality. 
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics is the most common illness after the depression. 
In a crisis of schizophrenia, people can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitation, that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution. 
It is very common to hear voices - voices command, which elicited comments or dialogue. 
The optical hallucinations are not rare. 
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the trivial, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations. 
Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of conscience. 
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum). 
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the situation, meaning focused on him. 
At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively. 
That is why the schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated. 
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust the reality, the illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded. 
To experience once in her life of a hallucination. 
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is seen during the psychosis, is fundamentally retained ". 
The thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of lived in a real framework. 
Why does our brain this kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers. 
Exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose momentarily the perception of reality, according to Fuchs. 
But only a small number of people develop a psychosis. 
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants. 
The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are tiny brain damage. 
It is assumed that the neuronale maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example, by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs. 
But what remains unexplained is how the neural system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years. 
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is a predisposition. 
Similarly the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters. 
When our brain heats. 
This is crazy, says professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck is that the psychotic suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to undo while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain. 
The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective. 
Kasten brings together for ten years reports of hallucinations and phenomena of images illusory: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "the unreal world in our heads ". 
The hallucinations are part of concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases. 
They include psychological problems such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma. 
It is surprising that in certain conditions even the brains of healthy people is subject to hallucinations. 
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that normally are inhibited. 
They take form when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions, are hyperactives or not sufficiently refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is lack of stimulation. 
The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis. 
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other mental states exceptional. 
In recent studies, a third of participants acknowledged having made at least once in her life experience a hallucination. 
In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years ago, she lives a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and it goes to high school. 
A young girl to normal indeed. 
If there was not the images and voices. 
During the recess, sometimes a young boy, thin, with long hair, wish him the floor. 
When she replied his comrades watch, surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy. 
They believe that this girl timid is a lunatic but Sarah K does not dream, it is certain. 
She is awake, hears and sees the boy as she sees and hears the girl who is sitting next to her on the bench. 
It can even see its presence temporarily. 
It is a good feeling, she found this young sympathetic. 
Am I mad?, wondered sometimes. 
But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again. 
The night appearances are, in general, frightening. 
Often the visions are cumbersome. 
When it is in class, sometimes it can follow the course because the teacher is just being present a new student in his eyes and ears When it is invisible to others and that the professor is clearly explain the equations in table. 
The night appearances are, in general, frightening. 
When, in the darkness of his room, it expects the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, it often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dream already, if the images she sees, faces grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on his arms and legs are before its eyes open or closed. 
Let me quiet, Cree to these creatures. 
It does not speak or his parents or friends, they would take to a mad. 
Fall 2009. Sarah K. has now 20 years. 
She had her ferry last year and she lives with her friend. 
A year ago the hallucinations have ceased. 
Since it came into contact via the Internet with the psychologist Kasten she knows very well that it is not crazy. 
The madness is also a work of art of despair. 
When someone is socially isolated or has not sufficient incentives, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain time. 
I assume that the brain is not busy enough, ensures that there is animation. 
Sarah K., single girl, was afraid of other children when she was small and often played alone. 
Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called Daddy, since it was in age to think, was not his real father. 
These are the same brain areas that are active for visual hallucinations and acoustic, and the impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to differentiate between the illusion and reality. "every experience ", according to Kasten" takes place in the brain, the reality is formed from there. 
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. " 
For Kasten, nocturnal dreams are also a form of hallucination. 
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those in acute psychosis. 
Unlike the schizophrenic, mentally healthy person is able to recognize that the fantasies are not real images. 
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent. 
There is only a step between the dream and the hallucination. 
In our world too focused on the conscience has unfortunately quickly tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the Clinical psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf. 
A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - madness is a work of art of despair. 
Schmidt-degenhard has studied the form of so-called oniroïde experience, a particular form of the conscience stirred by the dream. 
The experienced oniroïdes are very complex semi-rêves which are seen as real by the lives and that it cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of awakening. 
The state of consciousness oniroïde occurs during a trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathie which fully aware, experience a paralysis engine. 
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total inability and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation that affects his life, by his own imaginary world that is divorced from reality. 
It is a state of mental boundary between the dream and the hallucination. 
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world but the real situation is represented in the imagination. 
It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation itself intolerable, organizational capacity that is given to us men, not to sink into the none of the loss of consciousness. 
Everything is real even later in the memories. 
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian also describes his experiences oniroïdes in his book "change of heart" as action to safeguard the soul. 
He was 49 years, when his conscious part for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed a transplant; meanwhile, his body was sentenced to remain motionless in resuscitation. 
Claussen plunges into a world that it has created from scratch, visit foreign travel in time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot at his bedside ensuring on his health. 
He lives in the middle ages of noble who manufacture drugs based on blood. 
It is abducted by a Greek motorcycle who takes in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the firn Alps and meeting a Korean mafia. 
It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories. 
According to Claussen these domestic trips are fundamentally different from any dream. 
The dream is a completely different state, he wrote in describing what he lived. 
Instead of dreams, memories from mental travel are extremely clear and very detailed even years later. 
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience. 
The intensity of this lived shattered the horizon of our other everyday experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard. 
Ultimately, the oniroïdes, psychoses, hallucinations and experiences we show how our internal representations of external reality are fragile even in eve. 
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes the psychologist Kasten "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality." 
An experience that can also be quite rewarding. 
The first snow can fall 
Burda 
A 27 years, children will be the result of the publishing house. 
The appointment of Kallen to the position of CEO of editions Burda is an intermediate solution: over the longer term, Hubert Burda hopes that his two children resume the press group, he told the newspaper Spiegel. 
The holding company must remain 100% a family business. 
Hamburg - A long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of its children 
The two children will inherit 27 years and are firmly committed to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69, Spiegel. 
All the details have been settled in advance. 
The question of whether they will be active in the business will thereafter. 
It will also see if they are capable of. 
We cannot impose its children to 7, 500 staff without knowing whether they have the capacity to deal with them. 
This démolirait children as well as the company. 
Burda said last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the position Président-Directeur-Général in January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen. 
Kallen, 52, is a member of the Board of directors since 1999. 
It was responsible for the technology sector. 
He held the sector Treasury that is to say that he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance. 
And For the first time this is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions. 
The children of Burda have respectively 19 and 17 years, his son Felix would now 42 years, died a few years ago. 
The appointment of Kallen also serves to make the connection of 10 or 15 years " 
Burda said that the holding company must remain at 100% in the hands of the family. 
The ruins have always been held in families that have left lead by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous speculation unfortunate in thinking that they could climb ever higher. 
It has never been my strategy. 
I have never had rêvede universal power, Burda said. 
I see absolutely not in the role of a tutor as could be Springer and I do not intend to be part of these leagues international as the Time, these companies have taken too much importance. 
The promise of FonPeek 
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to watch his e-mail, without offering the possibility if only to see some type of attachments or surf the Internet. 
He took advantage of its five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the designated as one of the products of the year. 
In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people. 
Unlike smartphones, Peek offers a price and a monthly subscription very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone. 
Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service data to life, for six times more expensive than the Peek. 
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the event the Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation. 
It is also limited its grand-frère American, but includes a surprise. 
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes The roaming across Europe. 
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the WiFi (or a connection of Fon) to consult his mail. 
The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is a long time that it should operate. 
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a thesis in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print. 
The repeated reminders to the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have had a barely perceptible effect. 
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and it was not wrong. 
A small device as the FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators are starting to think differently and are studying various proposals to make their data network. 
Kindle is another good example, it includes the downloading of books and other research on the Internet. 
Without subscription and Without soup. 
It is a device connected and pay at its purchase and not every month. 
And that is what I hope to see a day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek proposes already in the United States. 
I do Not want to buy it. 
I look am mail on my phone, thank you. 
I would simply because I believe that it is a fairer formula for the consumer. 
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system. 
The preferred colour of Michelle 
The Yellow is, without doubt, the favourite colour of the first lady of the United States. 
If she went to the inauguration of Barack Obama to the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this colour, it has, in fact, chosen the same to accompany him in the second time, without doubt, the most important of his life: the award in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Michelle Obama was a model very similar in these two occasions: in addition to their colour ressemblante, a yellow firing towards green with brilliant, twice, consisted of three parts: the dress, jacket and the mantle, in the same tissues, and was decorated with a large embroidery or a necklace. 
So a first glance, it would appear that the first lady of the United States to follow the wake of Princess of Asturias and chose to deliver the same held. 
But the fabric in which are cut both sets them very different. 
If the it was a lace thick, however, it was in Oslo a printed velvet. 
The accessories also are different: green shoes to heel means for the first opportunity, and a similar model, but, this time. 
The hairdressing also has changed: The hair are now records when it was released last time. 
75% of working mothers have had problems because of their maternity 
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers. 
This is what reveals the study "Fertility and professional career women in Spain," conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer. 
The survey, conducted on 9 737 women aged 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of motherhood. 
The study indicates that there are many differences concerning the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of job. 
Those who do not work outside the home, working part-time or have a stable, are earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children. 
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, pushing the entry in the couple and the first pregnancy, and have fewer children. 
Women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after being installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to it, which led to repel the union and the arrival of children. 
In addition, the type of employment exercised influence largely motherhood, but less the start date of common life, "explains the researcher of CSIC Margarita Delgado. 
The level of Education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child. 
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later. 
The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation. 
For example, in the group aged between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher have been mothers respectively For the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average. 
"Another disctinction is also among women, depending on their level of education. 
While those who have done studies elementary marry and have their first child before finding stable employment, those with studies of average level or higher reverse this programme and give priority to obtaining a stable work as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child, "said Mrs Delgado. 
Diane Kruger also worth 
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its list jalousée ambassadors: Diane Kruger. 
From next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the mark, singing the universal currency "Because I Vaux. 
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses of the international stage, and join other celebrities included among L "Oréal Paris, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz. 
Before it, the last to enter this club if select were the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire). 
Among men, the brand of cosmetics also ambassadors of luxury: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, lessons of anatomy) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost). 
The price of British fashion 
The British have much to say in the world of fashion. 
Its greatest representatives, creators and mannequins, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual price, which took place in London, the Royal Court of Justice. 
No one has missed the appointment. 
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected best dummy of the year. 
The poker as Manuel Vincent 
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer of ases (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) 30 "X-rays" writers who have crossed his literary life (and sometimes, his other life). 
It does not depending predictable and apprehended (summary biographical, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the core of ignition of character created. 
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither fear nor the illuminations. 
Delicious pleasure, this book is also an invitation moving to readings and reviews. 
I leave you here a few snapshots. 
On Albert Camus: "In its pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual longing, almost physical, one that I felt without the name: the pleasure against the sad fate, morality without guilt and innocence no god." 
On Samuel Beckett: "nihilistic, Christian allegorical, he wrote what he had in the blood, not in the head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, as the blade of the knife which threatened to kill him." 
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman a passion that lasted 13 years, in the flesh of which he conjugua emotion of adultery to the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky by the road to perdition." 
On James Joyce: "Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand metres of literature, he must climb by the north face, on which the best climbers dropping still taken." 
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange type. 
In itself, he said that he was the heir of a landowner county and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile. 
These two dreams were of magnitude. " 
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up cry pushed from a bridge by This character of Munch to bring its echo until the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and it did in the brain itself and invoking the postériorité with a speech violate the maggots." 
On Dorothy Parker: "One day it began to knees and prayed:" God, I beg you to do that I constantly write as a woman. " 
On Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb were engraved to Spenser:" Sleep after the effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life, tired death delights. " 
On Virginia Wolf: "in its baggage she was carrying its depression. 
Her husband accepted very normally it tell him that Edward VII the épiait between the azalées or that birds singing in Greek. 
There has never seen a man as patient and lover of a névrosée whose literary talent exceeded the madness. " 
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos if it is to try to conceal Joyce in Baroja? 
That tried Benet if it is to shoot Baroja by Faulkner? 
What did this if it is to suck the glory of this man to serve as a pedestal? " 
A cowardly aggression 
Last week, my mother, who was about 70 years old, was walking in our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent beside it and our dog, a sang-mélé, saved the spa and not weighing more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they assenèrent two feet who left the dog seriously injured. 
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is funny to attack a free small animal without defence which, moreover, was on a leash. 
Add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking calmly and which, when it injuria these individuals, came to fear for his physical integrity, since a énergumène which attack an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, anyone lower than him. 
The episode occurred around 17 p. m., Tuesday as another in a district usually quiet. 
The dog has gémi all day. 
Of course, we have filed a complaint to the police station in the district although we doubt that this serves to much and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish. 
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact. 
We do not understand what is happening in young people to find amusing to mistreat free a defenceless animal which gives us the affection, friendship and is company. 
We do not know where is the good education and respect for animals and people. 
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmets 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among motorcyclists younger, as indicated today the two structures. 
This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of helmets, since it is the only element of protection to avoid injuries to the head, or even death, in the event of an accident in two wheels. 
Michelin indicated that the campaign was in line with his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of products always safer" and said it contributed to this objective by other actions to educational and informative. 
This new campaign of encouragement of helmets in two wheels, under the motto "to be or not to be ", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages of motorcycles, in order to ensure the widest possible dissemination. 
Finally, Michelin has stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop products always safer. 
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing 
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. 
The 9 425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the employers' federation of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, the dealers. 
However, to qualify the good news, since the reference for comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year. 
As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year. 
Since January, if you add up all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickups, vans, light vans and trucks lightweight chassis) 95 853 were sold. 
The big clouds that most affect their application have not dispelled. Indeed, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding. 
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of poor economic climate. 
Faced with this situation and the difference of passenger cars, aid for the purchase of the 2000E have little used. 
In addition to individuals, the self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself. 
Yesterday, in Ganvam, reminded again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses). 
The dealers association provides a year 2010 similar to that end, for which she calculates a drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4) of 19%. 
The emergency braking is now mandatory 
As has occurred with the anti-lock brakes ABS and as will take place with the ESP stability control systems, the emergency brake assistance will be a compulsory element on European cars. 
They are already mandatory on passenger cars and light commercial vehicles newly registered, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set up at the end of February 2011. 
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, even if, by its mode of action, it can also help prevent many rear shocks. 
The assistant emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the kick given by the driver. 
But it does not always maintained the pressure until the end. 
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for cars Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to build on the brakes before the collision, and half of them had not benefited from its full force. 
Up to 1 100 accidents 
The intervention of aid, in revancha, requires the maximum brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop. 
According to a study of the EU, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year. 
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that a disaster on four with injured would be avoided. 
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or a camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, In addition to acting slightly on the brakes. 
If the driver reacts, it aid by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary. 
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device carries the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage. 
General Motors regrowth until January the plan for Opel 
While the workers at the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April - probably the 8 - after Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the contingency plan for Opel. 
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, meant that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned. 
And this may mean that the final document, which will be submitted to workers and the governments of countries where the factories, be postponed until early 2010. 
In contrast, among GM, it ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days. 
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible. 
GM admits be in contact with potential new buyers. 
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch manufacturer of sports cars Skyper, supported by the Russian group converg, takes the importance. 
In the case where there would agree with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic. 
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained. 
The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder 
To design their last and valuable jewellery, engineers are parties of the Porsche Boxster S and managed to the thinning of nothing less than 80 kilograms, leaving the balance to only 1 275 kilograms. 
This has led to happen, first, the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manual, to reduce 21 kilos, to employ doors aluminium as those of the GT3, other 15 kilos of less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the gas tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of earned, climbing bacquets of sport, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos. 
Finally, they have relinquished the audio system CDR-30, winning six other kilograms and have replaced the poignéesdes doors by handles in tissues, saving the kilo remaining. 
Although the model also exists with the box PDK dual clutch, the test was carried out on a model to manual box of six speeds, mainly on secondary roads network of California, mountain, with particularly tortuous turns. 
His behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach. 
The weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with aplomb. 
On the contrary: it was a long time that we had not tested a model as small and light, at the same time, guarantees security in the turns, including at high speed. 
It is a small athlete, able to heat its musclesà small speed for the time, until we ask him to sprinter, to curb, recover and grow again its engine... 
It is out what we wanted. Through his leadership, also communicative that, the car will do what will indicate our hands on the steering wheel. 
And it will do so with surgical precision. 
Its engine at will 
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or through a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera. 
The ability of acceleration is brutal, either to The judgment or during recoveries. 
The suspensions are firm, but not harsh or uncomfortable. 
The roads that we have travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car was well managed potholes. 
The electronic assistants were barely act of presence throughout the journey, while some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning. 
Ultimately, a car ultralégère, more fun to drive and is much more than a simple amendment of the Boxster S. 
The car will be for sale in February 2010, at a price of 70 831 euros. 
"Bag Girl" 
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the line Coco Cocoon and starlette occasional parades of the house, the singer posted his face of bad girl with as much capacity as its bags Chanel. 
More than a "Bad Girl" or "it Girl ", it is a" Bag Girl ". 
The Baskonia is a victory in Israel 
The Caja Laboral received a resounding triumph in 91 - 82 during his visit on the ground hard of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences that plagued the team of Dusko Ivanovic. It is at the top of his group, after the great spectacle of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets to three points was the best of his team (29 evaluation). 
The team of Vitoria was able to fill the absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a great deal of commitment and collective work, even if she had to wait until the end to win. 
In addition, the great skill since the perimeter, with 16 baskets to three points scored, determined the final victory. 
The match started quickly for the blue and red, who took the advantage from the beginning. 
The fact that the first four baskets of the team of Vitoria are marked since the perimeter, foreshadowed that they had jumped on the ground with his wrists hot. 
English and Teletovic were the main architects of 18 - 20 final of the first quarter. 
The second quarter was on the same tone, but the team of Alava chose the game within Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by cheers and applause of return to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34 - 43). 
Teletovic was already starting to standing out as the best player of his team, with 13 points scored, although the "least six" Splitter assessment was already likely that this night would not be the best of Brazilian. 
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and the team of Avala wanted to remind the Vitoria that it does not win so easily on their ground, and through "the hand of Elias, they managed to enter the match. 
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to what the yellow take the advantage on the light (50 - 49). 
Other difficulties 
The players from Ivanovic, injured but far from dead, needed to pick up some clever actions to take the air, and it is at this point that the gun of Mirza Teletovic who, with three baskets to three consecutive points and aid to English and Ribas gave the meter to a reassuring score (54 - 67), and that the premises managed to increase at the end of the third quarter (57 - 67). 
The team of Avala out to play everything for everything in the last period and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) avisèrent that they were tired person their take what they had earned during the 30 first minutes. 
Nevertheless, Pnini Eidson, the best of their team, does not résignèrent and tried to support since the three points (70 - 77). 
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the players from Ivanovic did not rushed, defended well, and although the Israelis are closer together at the last minute (80 - 85), the party was already performed and the victory to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season. 
The Injuries prevent Unicaja of battle 
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece "Olympiacos and has given him the head of Group B of the Euroligue, in a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the domestic game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which have facilitated the Greek victory. 
The team of Malaga has not been frightened by the atmosphere of the flag of Peace and Friendship or by the scale of the rival, without doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget. 
The first quarter, helped to dream the Andalusian. An aggressive defence and three baskets to three consecutive points, two leader Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12 - 18, in the ninth minute. 
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the game within Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, has helped to reverse the score 22 - 20, in the thirteenth minute, when an action, an early fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led the disqualification of two players. 
The Greek team began operating in showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury the pivot English Joel Freeland and three personal misconduct of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja. 
The players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their baskets to three points, dug the advantage 44 - 32, in the nineteenth minute. 
A rebound impossible 
The third period was particularly offensive to the Olympiacos which, despite the 19 losses, was higher and arrived even to match the difference of the meeting in Malaga 66 - 48, at the twenty-seventh minute, as the head of the group. 
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the final exit from the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, injured during the meeting. 
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to his organization, baskets at three points of Cook, and the support of Lewis, left a little hope with 66 - 57, at the thirty-first minute. 
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players were pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area. 
The Croatian Nikola Vujcic, managed to trace the score to 81 - 62, in the 37th minute, and the Unicaja is submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.

Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya 
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa. 
The deposed president will abandon the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of its mandate. 
Francisco Catunda, chargé d "affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that" Mel "knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has refugee since September 21, before that date. 
"it is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of its mandate, it must seek another destination ". 
The chain has also cited the former agent, who has confirmed its intention that leave the embassy before the end of the deadline established: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone. 
After the elections of 29 November (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Embassy of Brazil until January. 
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil. 
The operation has ultimately failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of exiled political intended to impose the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti. 
Thank you very much 
After days roses since last spring, during which asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty there arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where officers take decisions on a future inherently uncertain. 
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize. 
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets were virtually finalised, and without questioning their political maverick of liquidity, begin to put a bit of sand in the wheels, as did the ECB, with their award to a year next week. 
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without measures heterodox and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums. 
The volatility of stock markets and business obligations are rising again, although they remain very distant paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year. 
The states were obliged to socialize the risk private and public debt is again affected. 
There is again a flight to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany were the shelters chosen by investors, causing an increase of differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany. 
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard Poor its threatened a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain. 
On the other hand, a bit of uncertainty is not bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard, trying to provoke a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy that had hampered the destructive effects of limiting the credit derivatives on the destruction of employment, whereas what we should do is declare a new day of Thanksgiving. 
However, the situation of Dubai resembles a fight between the tribal sheikhs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece. 
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government who discovers the pot in roses. 
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It would be perfectly irrational that Ecofin saves Hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a member country of the euro area not to meet its commitments. 
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has prompted the Greek government transparency and makes its citizens share the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances. 
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of standardization of risk premiums transitional, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable. 
In the case of Spain, as our differences of public debt increase to the obligations of European companies, nousn not to worry. 
If the European gap decreased and that our continued to increase, it would be a risk idiosyncratic Spanish. 
The Standard Poor's is an anecdote. When our forward-looking indicators require most services studies to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise up their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, returning to the burden with a Japanese model pourl Spanish economy, it does not bode much hope for their warning. 
Again, this has all the air to form an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spanish, even if for the moment "caution is mother of safety ". 
Sectors connected 
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene yesterday, before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where is discussed these days the energy strategy of Spain for the next two decades. 
After his speech, which was followed by the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán has outlined for the press that he had raised before the subcommittee, huit-clos. 
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest euros 50 000 million until 2020 and 60 000 million more between then and 2030, where nuclear power stations today in operation would remain open. 
If this is not the case, the necessary investments do not amount to 60 000 million but to 95 000. 
By contrast, Iberdola considers that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but the distribution networks and international interconnections. 
From 2020, the question is changing, and it will increase the power. 
His bet focuses on the gas to coal, with mechanisms for recovery of carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy. 
In this area, it considers that 18 000 MW of more are needed, with other "energies of support ". 
Galán, who believes that the bill of sustainable economy that the government has just approved is in line with what calls for his company, did not wish to attack the royal decree aimed to encourage consumption of national coal, which contradicts the policies to combat global warming. 
According to him, there was "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the measures "one-off ", as the president of Iberdrola. 
In any event, Galán believes that decisions to invest, although they are in the long term, must begin to be taken, because they are some time before reaching their maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them.

Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, market on which it is already working as a business manager of energy and water. 
The site at stake is a tunnel estimated at 1 700 million Australian dollars (around euros 1 047 million). 
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.

GBA is just to win a place on this market by its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of Leighton. 
Active millionaires 
Acciona on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier and activity in the sector desalination. 
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and directs the grouping of companies to build and manage the dessalinisateur of Adelaide, with a budget of 700 million. 
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets of the construction and management of infrastructure.

The French competition regulator imposed a fine of 63 million to France Telecom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region in the country. 
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and loyalty programs to consumers in the margins of the regulation. 
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-run company, accumulating more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it puts its competitors.

Their participation in the Champions League reported 476, 4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation 
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs, since its birth in 1992. 
Indeed, Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona won 467, 4 million, which puts them in third and fifth position of clubs who have pocketed the more money in this competition. 
The Manchester United is at the top of the list. 
The Manchester United is at the top of the list. 
Win the UEFA Champions League does not only the glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of big clubs. 
Indeed, competition has allocated 5 362.5 million to 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992 - 93 season, according to information from UEFA. 
The Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have been well served in this distribution. 
The club white was the third of the continent to reach the more money for his participation, and the only one, with the A. C. Milan, has won three times the trophy. 
The Catalan club, current taking the title and last winner of the old European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list. 
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams which, moreover, have billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League. 
And that, although they have lost before the Barça. 
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two). 
Distribution 
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distribution of money applied by UEFA. 
For this year, the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to earn 1 090 million through the Champions League. 
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413, 1 million fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million. 
In addition, those who have managed to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 euros for each match. 
There is also a bonus in the event of victory (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eighths of final receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in a quarter-final reçoivent3, 3 million. 
The last four teams will each receive 4 million. 
And the champion will win 9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist. 
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum 31.2 million. 
On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for winning the Super Cup in August. 
But in addition, there are the payments variables, which are enshrined 337.8 million. 
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market. 
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four dedicated places. 
The champion of the previous year gets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth. 
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played during the edition of the year.

A decision that in fact the first woman to hold A post leader in the food company. 
It is a newly created position that will depend directly to the president of the group. 
And it is not without controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged embezzlement of more than 230 million SOS to companies of Salazar. 
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months SOS reveals new misappropriation of funds cannot be ruled out. 
On the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the national Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.

New tools for the expertise of cars 
In these days of bad weather and accidents, garages are not the only winners. 
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are reduced to a garage, where an expert to assess the damage and the cost of repair. 
Every disaster is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex. 
To calculate the cost of compensation of between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including parts and labor can take two or three hours. 
However, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes. 
It is for this reason that almost 100% of experts use such systems. 
The Suppliers of services and solutions for the assessment of claims and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers, and then treat them and offer their customers in the form of an useful tool. 
In Spain, Audatex, Solera North American group, is the company leader; 80% of estimates are made with its products. 
Other companies in competition in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax. 
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple. 
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them their provides information in a different format. 
In addition, the amount of data to treat continues to increase, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and motors were launched that over the past 15 years. 
When a new car fate on the market, these companies are at work. 
It is a very difficult, because catalogue each thousand pieces of the vehicle and include its price. 
In addition, it establishes a graphic image "smart" of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger vehicle. 
If it is a model sold heavily, the work can be ready in a week if the process moving very quickly. 
If it is a little car sold, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.

Audatex invests 90 million every year to develop these databases. 
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and clients receive updates every two days. 
The development of this enormous flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and propose various products. 
The most common application for the repair and maintenance, but in different countries, there are also tools for the management of parts or to calculate the residual sale value or a car. 
The only company that has a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax. 
Audatex does not propose in our country, but it is in the United States.

There are cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles. 
In addition to the cost of parts, it takes into account the time to repair estimated by the manufacturer or the scales of paint. 
This tool is bought in terms of its use, for each estimate. 
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use little, up to 10 times per month. 
Then, each insurance company, which conducts thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex. 
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he came out of the assembly line, only through its chassis number. 
AudaGlass focuses on the glasses of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is open to the professional sector server on the Internet to bid on vehicles reported wrecks. 
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, analyses géo-démographiques or know the common problems by brand or model. 
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a specific mark went to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period.

Last October, the group Solera purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles evacuees. 
The operation has involved a cost of 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could widen next year to 15%.

The vintage cars can be re-registered, although they have been withdrawn, after complex approaches. 
Specifications of garage in four stages 
With the tool Auda-Taller, the company Audatex ensures that the user gets a quotation in only four steps: identify the vehicle, seek the replacement part, create a quotation and generate. 
The Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince the older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to the use of new management techniques. 
The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 of tourism, 109, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks. 
Of course, to use a computer and an Internet connection is required. 
Once the model to repair identified through its chassis number, a graphic image of model in question appears then selects the necessary part. 
The user can include variables such as the price of labour, increases or reductions, then it can print the specifications for the client. 
AudaTaller is not a tool to estimate as AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references. 
The main difference between these two systems is that for garages does not include The time of Labour estimated. 
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which may be the subject of a credit. 
Currently, the company Audatex works for that these images are in three dimensions. 
It is an innovation that mechanics are a very good eye, as it will, for example, to select a door and turn to see the inner.
