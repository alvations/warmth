What should they do, the ČSSD? the Czech Social Democrats in Prague are not aware of Voldemort, "Konditorei."
The new Office gentlemen of capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously some language barriers to overcome their old-new colleagues from the ODS in Prague Council and in the city of representation to understand at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "abgeklopft ', as they dominate the notorious Slang that has become popular in recent years, in which the current coalition partners in Prague at the helm.
The codierte vocabulary, in the long era of Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite was introduced, some of the most well-known actors, situations and Causae borrowed.
Surprisingly, the new councils in relation to these new notions something in the dark.
That, At least, they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I am more of a newcomer in the Prague policy", Lukáš responded Kaucký, the new Office Mr for culture, to the test "godfather of vocabulary."
But the Council Mr Březina - a political veteran, reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the concept of 'Golfloch'.
"This is the only expression of which you are submitting me, which I use now and again."
"otherwise, I think that not much of slang."
From the days before the leaf Aktuálně.cz in this year's June election vocabulary, the Congress of the ODS had published pickte editorial six words, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should the concepts' Voldemort ',' biggest Prague golf hole, "" Konditorei go in ',' bull necks "," betrayal of the capital "and" verblechen ".
Three Prague Council agreed to the test, the fourth - Mr Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first his participation in the talks, but then not even the headphones.
The fifth-in-Office, Mr, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"These are things I don't care and how the Civic Democrats themselves talking about - I do not."
"For me, it is how we understand our programmes," he countered.
As already indicated, would have Lukáš Kaucký mentioned in the above headline allegedly not recognised by the influential entrepreneurs and friend of the ex-mayor who Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only concept, he erriet correctly in the test, was "the greatest Prague golf hole."
"This is the tunnel Blanka," says Kaucký, added to security but added: "But I know this from the newspaper".
And jokingly: "I will probably have to show a language course."
"The Gulf hole" will not only matador Karel Březina, but also by the Council on the Environment Lukáš Plachý right as tunnel Blanka entziffert.
Both Social Democrats also know, however, for whom the term Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý senses even where this figure is and what it means to go "in the Konditorei
"I believe that that is, in some kind of Prague to go Gastronomiebetrieb ', is Plachý quite close to the solution to the problem, when we know that it is the seat of Janoušeks firms.
In line with Březina, but he claimed that this knowledge to have drawn from the newspapers, rather than him this vocabulary would own.
Judging from The test participants, there seems to be no similar naturalisations Slang 'repatriations' under the Social Democrats.
"I asked my colleagues too, but there is obviously something we really not."
"We call upon us, and we also use acronym or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - from his party colloquially called "Hulda."
"in school I was Bříza (Birke), but I do not know whether to call my colleagues," tells us Karel Březina his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried and behold - it works.
Mr Weinert Office is for the party of the kind of "one's grandfather" or less friendly to the 'old', the representative Miroslav poche ahead of the elections by machinations of the party-sponsorship is vocal by some colleagues' Igráček "(known Czech Lego-figure).
Moniker is the only one that the Social Democrats in the whose language.
Hulínský may not, if we call it "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another moniker the Prague chairman.
Be Spitzname 'doctor of rubber truncheons-rights "has alleged that Petr Hulínský his title juris doctor in the Bratislaver police academy.
The government wants to prevent the torture of "witch" and was a brochure out
Women in Burkina Faso to branded witches, usually some common social features.
They include more of the older generation, they cannot find work - for example for health reasons, they are constraint and have no children.
If one of these women to witch, they will be strictly isolated the rest of the village, so that they can be dangerous.
"Men are affected by this fate quite rare."
"Young and healthy women is spared this, since they help in the work and bear children," describes a Orden sister, the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a Spezialheim cares about more than a hundred women were emitted by their communities.
The local government now decided against these abnormal 'social measure ".
And, for this reason, a brochure, which is designed to prevent.
But There is a catch.
"More than 70 per cent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper 'derStandard "on the problem of written information.
To be accused of witchcraft, but also in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová tortured to death by three women and two men - with Petroleum and burned.
On this incident, the BBC reported servers.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would be only a combination of unfortunate circumstances.
Their version is oil inflamed, according to ritual Salbungen.
And, after the group tried, "an evil spirit" of the woman 'cure'.
The isolation of "witch" supporting the people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso," Fresserinnen human souls are used as a threat today, "he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso at least trying to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambia niche President last year the President himself mitgemischt properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh revived after the death of his aunt, a monstrous witch-hunt, since these supposedly share whose death had and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called Schamane from nearby Guinea to aid the accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's bodyguard indiscriminately treat detained men and women from Gambia niche villages kidnapped and on the farm in Kanilai expressed", the organisation Amnesty International in her report.
On the farm were forced from prison, a Absud plant with halluzinogener effect to drink, but also bowel and kidney problems.
Two of the arretierten people survived the residence on the farm.
Just because of international pressure, the almost a thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He fueling the kiln, yet pays higher rent
An elderly untersetzter men just leaves the society clients centre RPG Byty of "Kohlebarons" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest Privatbesitzers of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a commemorative envelope with three new rental agreements to three homes: For our own and the homes of his daughters and his son, just a sentence.
All three in the context of the so-called "deregulation" just rent increases.
Instead of 3,500 kronor per month to rent the son next year for a two-room apartment with kitchen in the second category 4100 kroner fork out.
"And There are times in housing not fluent hot water and heat must be in a simple coal stove," if he angered pointing the finger at the new lease of the son, whose signing he has a power.
"But what I," he says - signed half annoys and half resignedly.
The citizens association BytyOKD.cz, the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises not to sign the tenants, the new agreements simple, and to wait until 7 December at which it intends to publish guidance as it combats such contracts.
But the man beckons only.
"One says this, the other the", it makes a benighted face.
The region is Ostrava to large "deregulation laboratory."
After the New Year is this deregulation most rental housing in the Czech Republic before, whose tenants have not been highly marketable pay rent.
Aktuálně.cz, therefore, this "laboratory" personally.
The RPG-waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the region Ostrava and nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday packed.
Alongside the door the Bodyguards a safety agency and a call.
"Rent in 2011, so is a special Tastfeld Touchscreen.
Short angetippt and already spuckt the device a list of numbers.
Hardly the number entziffert "157, and we have already piepst at the large display from the ceiling of the waiting area.
Half a minute later is seen in the series.
A little later an old couple enters the waiting room to ask after the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room is obviously not the new rent.
Most people are here to the usual problems to solve - repairs, insurance and so on.
As of mid-November fly in the region Kuverts Ostrava with the new rental agreements with the most tenants of a total of 44.000 apartments in the portfolios of RPG in the letter boxes.
The RPG Byty proposes them in the letter a rent increase of around 15 to 38%.
The special switch to the new rent in clients centre is opened since 18 November.
"The action is a little over a week, which means that this is only the beginning," answer the ladies behind the counter for a moment of hesitation, as the "client" as a journalist dictator.
The deregulation and Bakalas former miners' homes are a sensitive issue.
Before the elections, the Vice-President Lubomír Parliament originating in Ostrava Zaorálek by the ČSSD raised this issue quite loudly, no surprise that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years of them I want a new floor."
"Not even ne besch. WC-glasses they were positioned," is the aforementioned man air.
Until now, according to the staff, especially pensioners on counters, in order to convince whether they promised tenants moderation really receive promises RPG when they Spezialangebot sign in time.
In a half reduced February rent the other tenants, the new lease until 15 December sign.
Until now, "switch" in Havířov but anything other than overloaded of questions.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent due in 2011," here appreciate the counters officials.
RPG offers both on their websites, as well as Wandtafeln individual Mietvereinbarungen, where it appears necessary.
But they will not agree to the new rent, the set by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but as information about the only viable and legitimate legal approach to understand," said RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court," says one of the workers from RPG Byty and one man on the street before the clients centre gives it at least partly right.
"I have 13,000 (kroner) pension, it left me 5,000 eating, where I should find the money for a legal dispute," he says.
Then the employees but uncertain.
"Time."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media, they should not sign and people still waiting for it," she notes.
The regulated rent ends in the largest part of the Czech Republic New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to increase the rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of maintenance rent is not the Wohnfonds from," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the Wohnungs portfolios of society RPG Byty and - particularly of the disgruntled tenants criticised neglect of housing fund is the homeowners believe that the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rent collected four billion in housing could invest in the four years from 2011 to 2014 to 5.2 billion.
At the large format LCD) display from the ceiling to the Polstersesseln in the waiting room of Havířov appear staged is always a few red shining information.
"The rent increases by 15% in 2011 and less concern 31 200 homes, which means more than 90% of the homes of RPG."
"Always this means most 7,50 CZK per square metre and month" is on the LCD screen to read.
Only 400 homes from the portfolio of RPG has increased the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is to increase extremely low rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square metre," argued RPG.
In 2600 housing remains the rent at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation rents not spectacular, but gradually within four and eight years ago.
What more - the company imposes a further commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see diagram) wants it back in the houses, especially in heat savings - in new windows and insulation.
But, primarily to those people benefit the agreements on the Mieterhöhung sign.
The architects saw - the office is also a nursery
The office building Avriopoint in Brno, the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini nursery here already, with all that implies: Colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the Außenterrasse.
This nursery is available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The Projektierungs- and architecture office Arch.Design, whose Ateliers a number of prominent Brünner buildings are expected from the first drafts for the new building Avriopoint to with the premises for its companies mini nursery.
Wise in, because most of his 90 staff (Interior) are in the baby boom-age and the company is keen that the Projektantinnen and architect women returning to work as quickly as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shortened the nursery is another bonus, the Arch.Design its employees in the concept of social programme to offer.
A politician's -architektinnen have it easier, their demanding professional and child care to reconcile.
The mini nursery is an original idea of staff, of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded financial assistance from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for its project.
The occupational mini nursery through the Operation programme, human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and from the state budget financed the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting CZK 8 million), the necessary facilities and equipment procured and for the duration of 2 years is for qualified staff and for the operation.
After The absorption of funds (2 years) is the company Arch.Design committed to the mini nursery 3 more years at their own cost.
The preparation of this project has a full year, although the company economy rating and the Antragsabwicklung active assistance.
The children looked very active qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the nursery can moderate children without age restrictions, although most of them over three years old.
And since this involves a mini nursery school, only 5 children to be present, however, change the day over several children each.
The nursery is operating flexibly to the needs of parents, the children all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the the without regard to the companies and their respective positions.
Although it is individual education and care, the programme content in the mini nursery nevertheless comparable with the framework programme of pre-school education.
The Children play not only here, especially will offer excellent teaching - ranging from basic knowledge to Vorschulunterricht, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative Games, but also equipped with a computer, which is available to children.
What is more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive Firmenmilieu.
The parents can always take a look at the children and so is stress during late collection of children from a nearby nursery.
So the parents use their work more productive.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relations.
Arch.Design reihte so under the Czech companies in the recruitment of new staff are clear offer Benefits, the family-friendly and encourage their recruitment marketing through these programmes.
A bone House fascinates even after 100 years. If you look at the Interieure of Gaudi
The roof seems to the backs of prehistoric Echse, the stairs as the vertebral column of Dinosauriers and Balkone are aufgerissene Fischmäuler.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local residents, the house with his organic forms the nicknames "bones house."
Organic forms, wild colours, the unusual use of stone, Kachelsplittern and mosaic, the scales facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all of these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the House plays with dream liable lines lack force paints and Texturen in nature and living creatures.
Only On closer inspection, they noticed that everything from geometry, rhythm and thoughtful dominated order.
In the night, the whole facade still plastic, dramatic and the special Anleuchtung reinforces the glory of the colours.
The same dynamic lines and tortuous forms also dominate the interior of the House.
Waves geformtes wood copied the window frames, support, Zierelemente of doors, even Gucklöcher and trade.
The House Batlló in the quarter Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43 was created by converting a house in 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese said.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialists Josep Batlló, was originally on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but in the end it agreed the idea Gaudís on an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The rental house, Casa Batlló devised Antoni Gaudí but not alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol together.
Just On the drawing board created the Dekorationen for representative housing and the Realitätenbesitzers use of mosaics of responding façade was his idea.
In the design of the facade, but also worked with many other Bildner and artists.
The joint work on the drafting of the Casa Batlló was the start of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also involved in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Park Güell where other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the home of the local inhabitants of its organic forms for the moniker Knochenhaus'.
Others called it the specific Fensteröffnungsmechanismus because of the "yawning House".
It also says that the top of the building is the sword of Saint George, of the existence of Catalonia.
But further bildhauerische elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí devised a unique central heating system for the time for the House with Entlüftungskanälen and typical Kaminen.
Something weird is their 45-degree slopes already.
In his creation Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes and did not influence this.
Before the appropriate planning permission but the start of construction - although he absorbed from the city of it claims made about the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later in completing the city fathers were so horrified by the result that they remedy.
Gentlemen of The Council found that among other things, that the construction with its pillars even in the public pavement intervening.
More amendments, however, it was not quite the opposite - only 15 days after the call of the urban community, Josep Batlló a motion authorising the lease of the two upper floors of the House - and was promptly given him.
The homeowners themselves, in the lower floors.
In the gallery in 2 Stock was a Gesellschaftssalon, on the third floor were bedrooms and private rooms housing.
The ground floor was leased to a Juweliergeschäft.
The whole sechsstöckige buildings undergoing a steps up to Dachterrasse.
The main elements of the redevelopments were all right corner and straight lines removed and replaced by bent and geschwungene walls.
Gaudí worked but also with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces.
The social part through the opening of Salontüren completely combine and greater society chatting comfortably without vertraulicheren on talks with a certain degree of intimacy.
The House received by Gaudís retrofit except a new facade of a very unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressively is also Gaudís game with the light, and the blue and white glasierten Kacheln with which the courtyard dressed and light.
The game these two colours gives maximum light all floors of the House.
While he made simply exploiting the principle that white reflects the light is better than dark colors, contrary to absorb sunlight.
The House Casa Batlló, in 2005 the World Heritage List Unesco, everyone can now visit.
The first floor is the geräumigste and prächtigste home made available to the public.
Homeowners decided only in The years to this step and that the 150.Geburtstags of the famous Creator.
As we noted that this is a very profitable business, retained inspections, indeed we extended it to other common and the Dachgeschossräume, including the Dachterrasse.
The price for an inspection of the is no trifling matter, however, he is EUR 16,50, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourists cards get 20% reduction.
This figure exceeds the entry prices to other Gaudí-construction in the city.
Who the real atmosphere of the house with his Drachentürmchen acquaintance should try to close friendship with one of the inhabitants and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the proper beds rust Women have other wishes than men?
Not the tollste bed framework, but the quality of the deck area - mattress and rust make the good bed.
These are, however, ways to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In selecting many things play a role - the weight, size, health and, last but not least, the sex of the Schläfers.
Equally important is the Interieur where mattress and rust.
Typical example?
In a Wochenendhaus, not regularly heated, are not well suited to Latexmatratzen because they are much longer, "warm".
In addition, they are much more serious than usual polyurethane foams mattresses.
And, it should be changed regularly.
If it is not enough Entlüftungskanälchen essentially have and still have a strong record, snarled moisture in, so it is not ruled out that the tape.
Of course, also plays a role in the election, accustomed to what one.
Anyone who has been a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with soft class, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"All you get from the NHL have returned, have complained to me that they can no longer sleep right here."
"For their abgeschundenen shoulders, and Hüften they simply need a soft layer from Visco-foam (memory Foam - a form of memory-Polymer)."
"This I recommend including sugar people under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the" information "from the ligaments and the skin is bad," says Sylva Hadamcziková, specialising in Polstermöbel.
I therefore have many years ago Eishockeyspielern, but also other customers this mattresses with Visco-sparkling (memory Foam) concerned.
"today, it is no longer a problem, because such mattresses provide among manufacturers Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. '
And one need not necessarily be a famous you learn to appreciate the benefits of foam Visco-.
This "miracle" actually works quite simple.
The foam optimalisiert his toughness and form in accordance with the absorbierten heat, in other words, he schmiegt downright warm body.
Nowhere is there in the night, rolling around as after a serious fight.
It is simply sleeping much better.
The viskoelastische sparkling also offers protection against Dekubitus (gangrene).
In the election of the Matratzengröße should be to body size is still the length of the Fußsohlen add some 21 to 34 inches.
As Mrs Mann on the 180 cm are large need as a 210 to 220 cm bed.
Each of the Schläfer should at least 90 cm is widely available, is 180 cm.
In Einzelbetten, for example in singles, 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort and also for the visitors.
Otherwise the following applies rule of thumb for the ideal bed broad: "If you on the back, should have enough room for the easy angewinkelten arms," advises mine. Polsterer Helena Prokopová, Zunftmeisterin and Raumausstatter for years the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this discussion at a university.
In a double bed everyone needs a own rust and his own mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are too high.
Otherwise there is nothing different amounts than the Roste assembling and this is not possible in every bed framework.
Schaummatratzen should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with the skeleton 15 cm, should be at least three centimetres in the form of class and the fine cushion.
"With the hand or the Hinsetzen the feathers on no account should we felt", warns Helen Prokopová.
Each mattress makes a specific Rosttyp.
Ganzgepolsterte beds with mattress and under position as evolved Siamzwillinge have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot drop and you cannot wash, which is already commonplace today.
And since we are in a single night between 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat loses, it is clear that the mattress after five to seven years slowly to a huge (and sieve).
Also therefore reject specialists advertising slogans in mattresses a life span of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantee.
Every cause has its ifs and buts.
And so a practical Council by dealers: Mattresses of 120 or 140 cm diameter the hygiene of waschbaren abziehbaren salaries should not be afraid, however, it is recommended to use a Matratzenschoner you can easily leave and wash.
Even if today usually Matratzenbezüge with Rundumreißverschluss manufactured so that you get after the opening two halves (immensely important for the Waschvorgang and washing machines size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, often alone, especially as the unequal struggle between David and Goliath.
They have in bed instead of a Rostes firm record?
Get out of it.
Or for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
So should they prefer the record with ventilation holes (if not content) and mattresses with pen skeleton and 15 cm minimum height so pockets with pen core and finely cushion.
Polyurethane foams mattresses belong on such a basis.
For not verstellbare Lattenroste with 14 to 18 (Lamellen) are Latex- or Sandwichmatratzen suited (possibly also combinations of Latex and Kokos), always afford it with a larger Lattenanzahl Roste from 28 and more pen with Lordosenstütze in Lendenwirbelbereich and the ability to regulate the Lattenhärte.
On verstellbare Lamellenroste does not include mattresses with Federskelett, since they do not belong to the ergonomische hardly react.
Alongside the attitudes of stiff the pen will make special flexible shoulder modules.
This is a special strengthen the pen, which allows the pen makes einzudrücken or even to verwinkeln that they allow the individual Einsinken the shoulder of the Schläfers.
Especially important for men with broad shoulders.
There is even Matratzenhersteller which have started to use "soft Herrenmatratzen" zones for the shoulder area.
In The ladies is thought - them fighting these soft zones in the Hüftgegend.
For most demanding customers are punktelastische wing stroke systems (Lattoflex) or Roste burden with points of contact-Pads with so Multitorsionsfederung.
The pressure will be distributed on several points, thus reducing the tension.
But, if the right mattress and right rust a bad (too big and fülliges), most are used Kopfkissen benefits lost.
Here too, a rule of thumb: The to the head, his top should only up to the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles relax.
Ideal is therefore a 50 x 60 cm big cushion, as for example the Scandinavians.
In the side should Kopfkissen (along with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the bed) offset the shoulder height.
Have our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (fat) Strohsäcken but with hay.
Modern manufacturers use natural materials, or at least their mixtures.
Also In the new magic formula "organic".
Instead of oil raw materials used to manufacture of Polyurethanschäumen increasingly naturelle oils - for example, Rizinus- and soya oil.
Soya is well used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic mattresses, which means their nuclear materials from purely natural origin is," said Petr Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials, but also in the production of Matratzenbezügen - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But one can also micro-capsules grant in sleep, Mr President fresh woodland or Lavendelduft spread.
Here too there is a difference between men and women.
While the men a "kühlender" Pflanzenextrakt from Birkenblättern used so that the Matratzenbezug absorb heat and cool the body can have the salary for women "wärmende" effect.
Extracts from red Paprikaschoten stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex will sleep, Mr President wohlig warm.
And The current favourites?
Foam mattresses from cold (he has greater Poren with devastated Zellstruktur and is therefore breathing trade more active than usual Polyurethan) and also a lot more flexible.
The combination of the various Kaltschäumen stiff (severity) and Visco-foaming does occur create More zones mattresses, know exactly where capita, hip and closely.
For a quality mattress, though, has to fork out 7,000 kronor and more.
Gesundheitsmatratzen but are usually with lower VAT burden, because they are considered medical device.
The first Czech companies were Gumotex this advantage.
You see, in the bed and the pair to save is not so easy.
And there are special offers of manufacturers and distributors, the two mattresses for the price of one.
So the brand Magniflex offers the mattress Duofreeze with in relation verstepptem Visco-foam memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will get free to do so.
It was the Tempur material which the era of viskoelastischen sparkling substances with open Zellstruktur and high density in almost kosmischem pace.
No surprise, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are involved in the launch enormous excessive.
Tempur will heat soft, cool milieu entrenched it again.
So it is to the human body is perfect and distributed in the best possible way, the body pressure.
It is therefore not only on the prevention of Druckbrand, but generally the sleep of comfort.
Viskoelastische sparkling substances will not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as for specific Fußpolstern used the legs and the Gefäßen provide relief.
Domestic producers use the example of sparkling substances Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people to have the kids under control surveillance devices
The fear for our own children, and so consider more and more parents are to monitor by GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for tracing cars that can equally well people locate what would be helpful in cases such as the trail recently unemployed disappearance of nine-year Anička Janatková.
The device is about as large as a packet of cigarettes but soon it will be no bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people, the case of the missing Anička in a funk and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
For the price of a violation of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that it is not all around pioneers, but an effective way to reduce the likelihood that it leads to tragedy", Petr Pilin society Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it cannot abuse of such devices, for example, if you know someone in the pocket, without it, but so far we have had no such case."
"Most customers buy it really," Pilin adds, for security reasons.
In his opinion, should the child but always know what purpose the "box" and how they are used in an emergency.
The Kinderpsychologin Dana Bočková notes, however, that if a child is such a thing may not wear, it simply emptied.
"Even very small children show great creativity, when it comes to certain things deliberately to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
"The phones awoke initially great expectations among parents, but they can be just as easy, as this new surveillance equipment," says Mrs Bočková.
Their opinion is also questionable whether such a body in the event of an attack really help.
"At Planned abduction, the kidnappers almost always checked whether the child has any electronics, it could be located."
"Today is the mobile phone."
"If such monitoring equipment wider use, they also because their sales would certainly accompanied by massive advertising".
"In these cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psychologist.
It acknowledges that similar devices in a sudden attack by a paedophile can be extremely helpful.
Roberta Čech RC monitoring by society, according to the tracking services offers both for cars for individuals, the existence of such an appliance can then help, even if it destroys immediately after the attack.
"The device is that it is hiring the respective position at certain intervals reported."
"Even if it would be destroyed, at least the final position of the person involved is available immediately."
"In more expensive equipment is even a Neigungsmesser integrated, in other words, if you are going hinfällt and movement, the device sends a warning immediately indicate the position," said Mr Čech.
His opinion, similar services could also smart phones with navigation, it just needs a special software einzuspielen.
The problem with the current positioning equipment is that it is either equipment in matchbox-size, similar to the supporters or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk that they will lose.
Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, it therefore testing devices, which look like ordinary digital clocks in the present.
"This has the advantage that the possible attackers do not realise that it is a monitoring and tracking device.
"Or he realises what the police only after a certain time, a time lead there," he adds.
Regardless of the direction in which the development - Armbändern or trailers, as always, the same technology used in vehicle tracking.
So The combination of positioning function through the GPS system (just as the Ms in the car) and the function of a mobile phone, which the current position.
The army has so many Zündschnüre quite the Czech Republic that umwickeln could you but only two years
The Czech army has 445 kilometres Zündschnüre purchased with explosives bomb.
The year before, the Ministry of Defence has 224 miles powder to the army camp.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces for 225 years ausgesorgt.
The only problem is the durability of the Zündschnüre - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the Zündschnüre by the Company STV Group, including For paltry 40 million kronor.
In his explanatory statement for the procurement of this huge amount of powder said the General Staff MF DNES, the soldiers would annually to consume 60 kilometres powder.
According to The research from Armeepyrotechnikern, MF DNES point raised is clear from this data that the whole army of an intensive year pyrotechnic training - all the generals and officers of the army commandos, up to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek is no exception.
Only then could the substantial annual consumption of 60 kilometres Zündschnüren reasonably justified.
This length to 25,000 Detonationen.
But would this army enough stocks for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts is that the training each new professional soldiers two metres powder is quite sufficient, then the army by this Neueinkäufe - also from the point of view of the increased needs of the pioneering special units - a reassuring supply for the already mentioned, 225 years.
It complained soldiers quickly use Brigade recently, in the Defence Minister Vondra, they have almost no more cartridges for hand guns, so register are severely restricted because of lack of resources.
Not to mention The Unterhosenmangel.
"Me is not why they are such huge Zündschnüre buy."
But it is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need. "
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want as traders largely concession," says Jan Děcký distribution managers the STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Department of Defence justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of powder, the army had so for at least ten years with this "ammunition" heckle him.
Jan Děcký use of the STV Group but talks only of a four-year duration of the Zündschnüre and police and Armeepyrotechniker only two years.
"With perfect storage are also mentioned possible four years", one of them, but wants to remain unnamed, not to be a soldier accused the criticism of the army.
After the expiry of the term must use any ammunition thoroughly tested whether it is reliable and not the lives of soldiers at risk.
But These tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the amount rebate for 445 kilometres powder.
"They cost us 60% less than last year supply of 244 miles," spokesman Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only by way of comparison, the annual consumption of Zündschnüren of Pyrotechnikern police, the munitions from the second world war or the Soviet brother army liquidate exceeds some years has barely 1,500 metres.
And ordered the police always just such quantities of ammunition it before the end of the long-term use can consume.
The safety of the Pyrotechniker because, furthermore, if one considers the possibility of more modern flexible purchases and therefore reliable Zündschnüre open.
The Ministry of Defence has already huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the times of the Warsaw Treaty, as the zweihunderttausendköpfige Czechoslovak People's Army for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyrotechnikern MF DNES raised the Czech armed forces have the same problem in a few years in the killing of hundreds of kilometres of old Zündschnüre today as "good" has bought.
Until today I have the contacts that I won because of competition
The winning placement in the competition "small entrepreneurs of the Year" have Lukáš Pytloun sales helped the franchise of its hotels.
Winners of the last year of competition "small entrepreneur of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success seems like a film script.
Lukáš Pytloun went willingly.
Only abroad he was aware that it lacks good accommodation options at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his holidays working abroad and by a bank loan erstand he baufälliges house with five homes.
Bearing in mind that he did university student in the sixth semester was, this was certainly a daunting.
"The price / quality ratio angered me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rekonstruierte apartment he rented to foreign workers.
The entire profit he immediately invested back into the house, which he then step by step to pension umbaute 54 beds.
Since then it managed in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec four pensions, two stilgerechte restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds all accommodation categories.
The komfortabelste them was until recently the four-star hotel "Pytloun design hotel.
This year, another first-class hotel.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties on the Pytloun franchise-hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneurs number one last year.
"In this licence sales at the behest of hotels had just the victory in the competition" entrepreneur of the year, "adds Mr Pytloun appreciation.
The victory gave him greater fame, popularity in Liberec and surrounding areas.
"I even realized often congratulated me on the street, they subsequently and I must say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend all who want to create something in this competition.
You also need not equal to win any visible is good.
He said that he until today from the contacts and acquaintances benefits, it would not.
"With Some people because of competition, I still maintain regular business relations.
The success of the glory, in his view, even a little on any of its staff.
And since he has the seventy.
"When I see them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something, the general recognition."
I see this not only as a personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us. "
"My name is just something to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my successors a ruhigeres year than we had in Farmet
The victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination has Farmet the worst.
The price of the first rank of competition Vodafone company of the year last year, Karel Žďárský, the company owners of Farmet.
The jury then paid tribute to the effort he is from the small Werkzeugbau in Česká Skalice a company from the ground stampfte that hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this not only myself but also encourages all my staff and our self-awareness in the fight with the competition has encouraged," says the previous winners.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet was the effort to do something useful.
And when the state his father Karel Žďárský as compensation for confiscated property by the communists as a small workshop offered to lease, did he not long left his career in his father's company, and in the ditch by then he was founded with a few comrades a company to manufacture their own Plastikwannen.
A short time later, they began to focus on Pflanzenölpressen.
Within 18 years, they are the largest manufacturer of automatic Pressen across central Europe.
But the success in the competition and its Medialisierung it is also a non-specialized public.
"Not only that our customers the brand Farmet now clearly intensive exercise, including our foreign partners began the fact, to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success to attach greater value in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year was in Farmet, however, not only in the euphoria of victory.
The tribute came from the economic results of the company in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And 2009 has been the most difficult year for the sale of tools construction products.
The crisis, still less the citizens but, above all, particularly schüttelte reached its peak, many companies were forced to their investment projects and the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"This situation we could not escape."
"The sales were reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and even resort to layoffs," said Karel Žďárský
A viable companies must sometimes such unpopular measures.
But managed to get to grips with the situation and to keep the company in the black figures, although lower profits than before the crisis.
When the company was not prepared to make cuts in investment in research and development.
"From The grant, we built a research and training centre, bestärkten our presentation at international trade fairs and domestic prices bought main exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The sales are growing, and with them, the number of new staff.
"I wish The new winner much joy of victory - but in ruhigerer atmosphere," Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll, removing nonsensical regulations
The survey "the absurdity of the year" is the fourth time part of business competition.
Some nonsensical rules were already from the face of the earth.
The winners of the dubious next year round the opinion poll "absurdity of the year" has the duty to documents to authorities, the online available.
So, more than a third of not quite four thousand stimmabgebenden entrepreneurs.
So the social security administration demanded a paper extract from the register, even if the officials had access by two Mausklicks.
The opinion poll is changing now.
"The Czech social security administration will in future when controls of Sozialversicherungszahlern no extracts from the commercial register demand more," led by ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the survey "absurdity" of the year, it is all rules and orders to entrepreneurs have to meet in the Czech Republic and lift the nonsensical.
This is the fourth time this year as part of a business competition, the tsch. Business newspaper (HN), the public is growing in popularity.
If the three thousand people participating in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No surprise, because there are still a lot of legal obligations only serve to hinder the business.
"For example, on the number of income tax forms, we take a front rank in the world," said Karel Havlíček from the Association of small and medium-size companies and businesspeople in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of business activity in the last few years the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank is the Czech Republic in terms of corporate conditions the rank 74. An eight seats, compared to the previous year, worse placement.
The competition was absurdity of the year for the first time in years and each year to the same scenario.
Everyone can from April until print of competition at the end of September, administrative and bureaucratic nonsense.
The gym is the website address www.firmaroku.cz. after the organisers of the competition seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and the public Internet websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz vote.
It let the absurdity of the most votes.
For this year's survey were already more than a hundred, 105 senseless rules and orders.
The clues come not only from employers, but also of professional organisations and journalists.
Among the nominated "Fina list" of competition, including provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and quickly road tolls to pay or that employers with 20 staff, two offices and two toilets vorrichten every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The proclamation of competition at the beginning of November at the Prague Wenzelsplatz is part of a Happenings, regularly attended personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of small or medium-sized businesses and the Tsch businesspeople. Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the game.
"Where the state is the entrepreneurs spanner into the works, there can be no real economic recovery, so it is my aim every year at least thirty paragraphs lift today entrepreneurs unnecessarily complicate their businesses," said Martin Kocourek, the minister of industry and trade.
The efforts of nonsensical orders from the world to create effective.
In 2007 rankled people most entrepreneurs obligation, the Gewerbeamt on where their permanent factory have the intention to declare three days in advance, with an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes drive.
This duty was under a review of Gewerbegesetzes lifted.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes - the duty, the labour office missions by workers in volume by up to 30 days to notify - was abolished by the law on so-called "green card".
And, all good things come in threes.
The absurdity of 2009 was elected the regulation which it imposed physiotherapists, in Sprechzimmer a mirror, a refrigerator and two Personenwaagen.
This regulation was by the Ministry of Health in this year - the refrigerator duty fell away.
A new category validates socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environment, education or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition between economic newspaper (HN) is the category "responsible company of 2010."

This year "s first year in this special category of the main competition Vodafon company of the year school firms for success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirativ and would provide enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they differ in regard to the subject of their activities diametrically opposed, yet their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
Here it is, for example, gehandicapte people, because of personal problems or the health of its own staff.
Among the fourteen Fina lists from across the Czech Republic appeared as, for example, the Prague software company et Netera that created not formal sports teams among its staff, which then attending many tournaments in a variety of sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the region Pardubice is society Isolit-bravo for the past 17 years, the main sponsor of a trust fund for gehandicapte children.
A paper mill from Poděbrady cares exemplary for their health disabled employees, which represent 70 percent of its workforce, for which the region Bohemia "was celebrated in competition; they entitled" responsible firm Vodafone company of the year, documented in this region, the third rank.
In the region Olomouc won the accounting firm MiRyz soft, including a fluid and also to an average of 35 hours per week reduced hours and this without proportionate cutting wages.
The jury in the title honorierte award but also the fact that the company predominantly in Czech shopping manufacturers, citizens' initiatives in their area and environmentally friendly principles.

Pilsner soil Fund - arrests the police during a public tender
In The building of soil Fund in Pilsen, anti-corruption police arrests in recent days.
It was the local media entrepreneurs and real estate dealers Luboš G. from the Detektiven in handcuffs.
These had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition to be held just Restitutionsansprüchen processing so that the competition offered plots a specific zufielen interested.
This should Luboš G. paid for half a million.
"At this stage, I can only confirm that the police a person for the offence of fraudulent practices in a public competition is," said Antonie Zelená, the leader of the newspaper 'Právo' Pilsner prosecutor, further details could not provide it in terms of the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman from the police.
In what way he could manipulate the public competition, we can only speculate, given the lack of official information.
The spokesman of the soil fund Lubomír Černá led to the question of Právo, the police have Pilsner of soil Fund arrests and this during a public competition.
"It was a client, and not one of our employees' defined her.
The public was Mrs Černá competition, according to the correct designation 'call for tenders of claims on the transfer of land in accordance with the law "and would take place in cases where several applicants offered interest in the land bezeigen.
"These people offer under the request by the transfer to a higher value of begleichenden Restitutionsansprüche than the proclaimed land value."
"In accordance with the offer entitlements will determine the order of the potential acquirer, then gives the soil fund the land on the person with the highest offer," said the spokesman of the fund.
Luboš G. were obviously provide information to those who request had notified and because he was justified in person as he had bought a number of Restitutionsansprüchen, he offered a property interests in that he is withdrawing from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in to arrest him.
Luboš G. had in the past too good contacts with the Pilsner land fund.
He also played in the issue of the former head of the soil fund Václav Sankota a role has been prosecuted because he Ersatzrestitutionen plots, which already works location decisions were taken.
Then acquired Luboš G. on soil Fund for example plots to build public roads, more precisely, to the place where the construction of the Zufahrtsmagistrale were destined for the industrial area Borské Pole was planned.
Later He exchanged these very favourable to the magistrate directly against a house in the historic centre of the city, the value of the land far exceeded.
The local authority had to then reluctantly gone in order not to jeopardise the works by blocking of the land.
Housing households rise by several hundred per month
Households need from January not only with higher costs for all types of energy, but also with more water and sewage charges and for district heating and grow some rents.
Families are so from January several hundred kroner per month must learn more from the wallet than before.
Electricity is more expensive, gas up 4.6 per cent to 2 per cent and more in some cities, it will be up to a tenth have to pay more for water supplies and some expensive district heating supplies.
The electricity prices Only costs the housing budgets every year several hundred kronor.
The high electricity prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, is to blame so the clear support of electricity from renewable sources, notably from photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only moderately expensive, however, if the people most heat must have and the highest consumption.
So here is with several hundred kronor per year.
While electricity and gas in the Czech Republic will be more expensive, prices for heating vary from city to city.
Above all, more places are planning price increases.
So, For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové from January for distance heating pay up to 50 kronor a month, more than 1,000 kronor per year pay families in Liberec.
The people of Prague again threaten 9% higher water and sewer fees, and this is the case that the city infrastructure rent increases.
If changing the rent, there are only 6.8%.
The price is compared to the whole, still the lowest in the Czech Republic in Prague.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges by 7.4% rise.
Huge rent increases, for example, in 140,000 rental housing to expect that from January is known as the rent regulation disappearing.
So for example, Is planning the housing company CPI Byty in Ústí nad Labem 2,500 homes has to increase the rent from January equal to 100%.
Anyone who does not agree with this rental increase wants the company to court.
The regulated rents, which today still in approximately 300,000 homes pay should increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children betrinken with 'Fernet and rum, beer is out - it is simply too slowly
'Fernet, rum and vodka, for just a good whisky, the father of Hausbar has stolen.
These are the drinks after enjoyed drunken Czech teenager under fifteen most notbehandelt.
Children are No exception, their hangovers repeatedly in hospital ausschlafen.
This is from the experience of doctors, with similar cases in the inclusion of child departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion, simply because it takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly of hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief doctor of the children's unit in the Bohemian clinic Hořovice.
"whisky, if it succeeds, the father of a bottle of Hausbar to snatch, and if not, then at least 'Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that it blended with juice can smell it not so hard," says the head doctor.
The spokesman of the Fakultätskrankenhauses Motol Eva Jurinová gives him right.
"Most 'Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools."
"Sometimes it was also about slivovice, you take home", Mrs Jurinová.
Chief doctor Pelikán, three or four ten year olds drinkers in the hospital admission long is no exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice he ten years since this year, he was working in the hospital Motol paediatric use section, where ambulances angetrunkene pupils from Middle and distance selling of ablieferten.
"A girl had four allergic."
"It began her career with 12 years ago, when the first time with 3.5 per mil alcohol in the blood and in combination with" Extase "has been hospitalised," the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"It was in the exhibition site Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing is that it was their mother not strange found that 48 hours not her daughter came home," the chief doctor wondered.
The lack of interest by parents or their incredible tolerance in Anstoßen with their own Sprösslingen is regarded as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism by children.
A real dependency in the true sense of the word, according to the experts in children.
"under Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomenon to understand and that is not the case with these children".
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic, "says chief doctor Pelikán.
The spokesman for the hospital Motol, according to Mrs Jurinová until mid-November, were around 40 drunken children admitted to the abandonment of children and youth Department of medicine.
But only with severe cases of alcohol poisoning, a hospital to go in the statistics.
Drunken children after ambulatory care from parents or may be brought home by the police, not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children as only a bottle of spirits in school desk austrinken there are opinion of Mr Pelikán three year time Amplituden, 100% is good: Walpurgisnacht, Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either from pain because of the bad certificate or joy on the holiday."
"In the Walpurgisnacht I have already seen in the opening seven drunken children at once," said Dr Pelikán.
A betrunkenes child spend the night under medical supervision, paradoxically, is better off than a child who has to contend with a nasty hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after the Dehydration and lack of glucose that can be in hospital with a flüssigkeitsspendenden Infusion with glucose, the body of the missing, distribute and nutrients.
"Clearly they are better off, because after the 'nice' experience in the evening, raise them with good humour to somewhere without something hurts."
"They are only slightly confused about where they are," Dr Pelikán admits, although he sometimes at least good humour to perish by the patients he considers the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because of the transport with the rescue and the night in an acute bed come well on a few tens of thousand kronor.
"Occasionally I have an educational resources used, if I have direct the children to visit calculated what their drunkenness has cost and that it may well happen that they take must work to earn the money for a single such Fete", the whole holidays added Dr Pelikán added.
In his view, the health insurance but not after Regressverfahren, in order to cure the trunkenen children still-necessary costs of the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light aircraft L-159, out of a total of five of the Czech defence ministry against the Casa C-295M transport plane has flown on Tuesday in the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish plane manufacturer EADS Casa - sets.
It is the first time that machines of this type in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they were only manoeuvres or air shows to see.
It is the airline capable Zweisitzerversion L-159T1 by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are einsitzige L-159.
These are currently einkonserviert in Aero Vodochody, the broker this business - the company Omnipol - it has accepted last week.
When the aircraft physically from Vodochody expediert, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence is not yet known.
The einsitzigen fighter plane L-159 again from long term stored planes have been singled out and this without further deposits and investment on the part of the portfolio of the Ministry.
"The dual seat-L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," said the newspaper Pejšek Právo.
He added that the army will not have to manage without zweisitzige fighter aircraft, because the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million-dollar contract on the reorganization of four superfluous L-159 on the two-seat version signed.
A new aircraft, the Army in July, the second wants it by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek EADS has pledged to fight to aircraft in the equipment of NATO countries.
"The Treaty is clearly stated that the company EADS customers of the aircraft L-159, and that this training of pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the Abnehmers how he realised the matter" that led Pejšek.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government has no interest in the L-159.
Barter of five L-159 against Casa a transport plane and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion kroner was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence had had to buy a tender procedure advertised, but spoke directly to EADS.
The former defence office argued that this exchange will support the future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which they used only 24 it wanted to sell the remainder.
The purchase of aircraft Casa will also have a legal process.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select The aircraft because of a ganzeuropäischen tender and not by raising a single manufacturer.
The army has already adopted three aircraft Casa, the last to land at the Airport Kbely within 14 days.
A long finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose finger is long, as the Ringfinger, are obviously a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That is the surprising results of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer can serve and this particular to sixty in men," said the signing of the study, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men are necessarily a prostate cancer testing should, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health problems, added Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009 followed it with their colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants of the study was the fingers of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
For these men was the same likelihood of prostate cancer, as for 19% of those men whose vaccination and finger were equally long.
In men, whose finger was longer than the ring finger, fell by 33%, however, this risk in men to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, in prenatal age form obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child in the womb.
Less testosterone is a long finger.
Previous research found that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticists and former chairman of the National Academy of Sciences, said ČTK him was this study fleetingly aware, he nevertheless consider that the relationship between the finger length and cancer risk have not proved to be "completely".

American soldiers have a new 'smart weapon. "
The American forces in Afghanistan for the first time a new "smart" weapon, the only under their Codebezeichnung XM- 25 is known.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon influenced the conflict there with the Taliban and shifts the balance in their favor.
The new weapon is such a thing as a super-precise walnut.
Their projectiles by laser with an accuracy of just a few metres into the goal.
The specific bore 25 mm shells that were developed for firing grenades and contain dangerous explosive work practically how small.
The missiles can be programmed so that they can not only to the target, but at any point their ballistic explode on impact.
That means that you cannot use it against an enemy that hides behind a barrier - a wall or in front.
From the top, it is usually not protected, the murderous steel cluster rain can therefore easily except shoot him from above.
Richard Audett, according to the development of the XM-25, is involved in the new battle rifle the first infantry weapon to harness the 'intelligent' technologies.

400 jobs will be relocated
The company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year will be 400 employees their jobs from the previous office building on Marienbader place in bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu shifted its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and their maintenance specialist sectors giant on Wednesday told their jobs will be 400 men and women in July next year from the previous office building on Marienbader place in bad Homburg the Astro Park, this is a huge office complex on the part Niederrad Lyons Frankfurt street in the city.
A spokesman for Fujitsu said, in the medium term, there should still be another 100 jobs of the group be placed in the region were distributed.
The rental supply is extremely attractive also would have been the major offices in Astro Park, the way the staff better.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu has been only tenants.
The competent manager Bernd Wagner said, with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure ".
The excellent tied to the airport is for a global companies such as Fujitsu is of great importance.
The latest move a major company within the region called yesterday joy among the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurt Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a player has been won.
It was a "fantastic location commitment".
Fujitsu passe to the city, the location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Green) regretted the decision.
The city early in the management of the intention had been informed.
"We have offered the companies naturally our aid," said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts had nothing to the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property on Marienbader place can change.
Ultimately would economic reasons made all the difference.
Now there is a long, empty to to prevent such prominent.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is helpful."
The Fujitsu has used House on City Hall and the neighbouring 'small vertical "were with the other buildings on Marienbader place ten years ago to the most controversial works of Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private Projektentwicklers arose between City Hall station and a new Stadtentree, both because of the massive building before land and partly as a car park the size of the buildings for criticism.
2001 was the investment advisory and credit-rating companies Feri, the software manufacturers for travel distribution systems, start Amadeus, and then with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu Siemens houses.
The Fujitsu buildings used in 2006 by the Frankfurter German real estate opportunities Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund acquired and a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT-Provider in the world.
It is companies, for example, computers and servers willing and also makes the necessary service.
The establishment in the Rhine-Main-area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employer Fujitsu in Munich.
From bad Homburg prefers the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad a further subsidiaries at this site to Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.

Amazon servers - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in trouble.
Internet service providers Amazon has banished the revelation platform of its servers.
There is perhaps political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret Diplomaten-Depeschen.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is supposedly in England.
The revelation platform Wikileaks machine in the United States increasingly under attack.
Internet activists lost access to their past American server and are now seeking an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott by Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on wanted lists by Interpol, to reside in Britain after a newspaper report.
"WikiLeaks Amazon server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," shared the Enthüllungs activists by short news service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before the Internet company Amazon the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had in the publication of secret diplomatic diplomatic cables on the Amazon Web services (AWS) are the high numbers of access to the documents.
By Twitter said the step further: "Prima Wikileaks - our dollar will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon such problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop to sell books."
Amazon have the use of its servers by Wikileaks stopped after staff from Senator Joe Lieberman enquiries had told the television station CNN invoking the office Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Amazon had threatened a boycott, told the British "Guardian."
"I would have liked that Amazon this measure sooner takes given the previous publications classified information by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called on the platform in other countries to deny use servers.
"wikileaks' illegal, hideous and thuggery puts our national security and endangering lives around the world," it was analysed in a communication of party senator.
"No responsible companies, whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to disseminate stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange on suspicion of rape, is being sought by the authorities in Sweden, is on the wanted list of Interpol.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australians in Britain, the exact location is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist investigations in Sweden has always called intrigue its opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson in London, said there had been threats.
"There have even been calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore Assange rightly fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to comments from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations should be executed for treason and.
In Canada, a government adviser said chief Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - in television, Assange "should be killed" and "Obama could use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, while a tennis match.
The spokesman of US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, if it is responsible for recently reported spy-calls to diplomats.
"I am not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a type with a website," Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its website. '
The American government is the protection of their databases fully to the test.
As special agent was the deputy director of the centre for anti-terrorism measures, Russell Travers, appointed to the White House announced.
Travers was responsible, "the message to develop the necessary structural reforms," after the disclosure of reports by Wikileaks necessary.
The White House also want to check how the entire government information informally and protects.
The American government also announced that for the safety of dissidents and activists want to ensure that they should by Wikileaks published in jeopardy.
"We have done everything to come in contact with them," said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them, if that should be needed."
The ice-university
In "gelato University" in Bologna Eiskonditoren prepared for better times of the year.
The three-day Grundkurs for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world.
Why is actually the whole ice?
The Gelatiere and the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere on German something old-fashioned the Eiskonditor represents cream following all the rules of the Italian Eismacherkunst.
The Gelataio is catching up with a Spachtel the ice cream from the Kühltheke, it abolishes the Waffel and then selling them.
In order to know this, we must not Anzola Dell Emilia Bologna in the province.
But who would like to know more about ice, is not in the 'gelato-University "the Italian firm Carpigiani over.
The ice University has the manufacturer of Eismaschinen in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines everywhere the high Italian ideals.
The three-day Grundkurs for future Gelatieri has the largest feeder and visitors from around the world.
But there are also more day Spezialkurse around the Schokoladeneis and internships in the House own Eisdiele.
Some in the mid-life crisis dreams of a new career, other cars simply let the treacherous ice of vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and the country's industrial Ice-cream will provide a European quality product.
Anke from Berlin is business adviser and after years in a nerve-racking job eintüten gone.
Two young Egyptians dream in Cairo to open a Eisdiele.
A man from Malta and a wish to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars from Brazil - and the Canadian housewife Julia is because their children Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari declared the participants first the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only good taste, but also the seidige fluidity and good consistency.
Luciano forgets his training but also not the icing on the cake of national and südländischen excess construction: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is still plenty of romanticism."
The first step to manufacturing seems very simple.
Luciano dump the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a major Mixgerät with an electronic programme everything to 85 degrees heated and then immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns to a tap on the machine, and is a white pasteurised Basiscreme basis for all Milcheissorten.
The teacher immediately with questions: Can ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can one of their own Experimentierlust free rein?
Luciano warns, the spirit of the age to be fooled.
Who of ice cream "only from natural ingredients", has probably still stabilisers - usually a natural product, such as Guarkernmehl from the Guarbohne.
Of course you can ice without stabiliser, only it must then be sold within a day, otherwise sackt it, and bite the customer to Eiskörnchen louder.
Certain variations in the mass are allowed.
There will be more Exciting with flavourings.
For the ice taste different Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients in the fruit-department or the sweets of supermarket buying.
In addition, there are powder and Pasten.
"The suppliers are all trying to foist onto dozens aromatic additives you."
"But you should simply experiment."
Either the Fruchtsorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in the ice cream from the white reason mass with eggs to the yellow cream and cocoa powder into the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations offered.
Now the course participants in the Eismaschinen.
Luciano will they each four different types of Vanille-, Schokolade-, Mokka- and produce Haselnuss-Eis - with or without eggs in the mass with more or less Vanillearoma or other natural supplements.
The same experiment will also Fruchteissorten.
More flavourings, more fruit-Püree - geschmacklich is not necessarily better.
Haselnuss-ice tastes not necessarily nut, when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi-ice, the working group, the more fruit, using less water and less stabiliser.
Only a balanced combination would highlight the taste of a gelato clear says Luciano.
Eisherstellung is a purely mathematical exercise: Will peach-Püree used with a lot of sugar, the sugar in the recipe must be reduced.
For Zitroneneis an extra dose of sugar is necessary.
Luciano a device, with which he prefers the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers to measure the Oechsle in grape musts).
Fortunately, facilitate tables the calculation.
Ice to make requires not so much physical use as before.
Not only the equipment for the automatic restoration of basic mass helps.
There is also a device in the ready-made ice-mix at the same time cremig beaten and freezing temperatures refrigerators.
Despite all the automated remain accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo acquitted him and his colleagues from top to bottom with Fruchtpüree than the colossal hand blenders spiral out of control.
"In every direction," says Maestro Luciano, "it is only a matter of time until something happens."
Inspectors in Zwielicht
The European Food Authority EFSA is with Genpflanzen experimental industry.
This charge now formulated the group of experts understand the impact assessment test Biotech, the independent institute for biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well documented," said test biotech leader Christoph then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the EFSA expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another EFSA expert was for years the lobbyists Association Ilsi under contract.
The will of companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer paid.
Kuiper was instrumental in the EFSA test requirements for Genpflanzen worked and am in a clear conflict of interests, then criticised.
The EFSA rules are (manner, word for word, with position papers of the Ilsi and deceive the imprint of the industry, which really should be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
It is the second time that test Biotech bemängle a conflict of interest.
It is a high-level EFSA Managerin recently without restrictions or transitional period on the Swiss company Syngenta farm - and have changed sides.
The funds also German radio (MDR) recently had personal links between kontrollierender EU authority and industrial lobby reveals what has made the environment Federal Office as well as EU parliamentarians avenue.
The EFSA can However, see no conflict of interest.
We use every serious data, even on such industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says in a statement.
The experts who work for EFSA, we ask that they have no contact with the industry.
But they have to disclose them.
Kuiper gives his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This describes himself as a neutral forum for experts from academia, industry and policy - including on risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby.
In the matter criticize independent experts as then that genetically modified crops currently feeding without any attempt Genpflanzen in animals be allowed and the response to environmental influences will not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize on arable power," says then.
Current practice is only isolated proteins, but not the whole Genpflanze to test how artificial no reliable results.
"If the risks should not be how you find it?" Asks then pointed.
It is also Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist had since 1994 in the engineering and is currently at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is trying in this area, as in the United States now in Europe is becoming more critical scientists to influence or discredit.
There is therefore hardly researchers, companies are intertwined.
For businesses critical studies would usually not published.
"The industry," claims Hilbeck controls the security research.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has also concerned what totalling approximately 400 kg.
On Monday night, he was leading the Tuba Stuttgart station on the back.
It was Demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September were the dredging angerückt and had started a major piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Thousands marched against S21, billions Tieferlegung the train station.
When it came to freeze, a large part of the wing in ruins.
Split in 6,000 to 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer produce, a soft rough stone between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is Bildhauer in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few scraps.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"They must not disappear."
He he: "A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earth."
When he took a aufsägte, after Zigarettenqualm rat.
He knows What he will do with the slice, not yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell.
The trail of Stuttgart stones in a forest in Tübingen to a former Munitionsdepot the French army, where Manuel Rongen Stein-Reich has built.
The 44-year-olds with old stones.
He has bought all, on the demolition in Stuttgart fell.
"It would be a disgrace for Schotter gemahlen or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a Holzbüdchen that was once an Wachhäuschen.
Insulted and threatened him, he is telling when in September in the newspapers that he bought the remnants of the Nordflügels of Abbruchunternehmer.
But he has talked with the S-21 opponents for days.
And he has told them that he could but nothing for the demolition.
And if it is, then it is the wisest thing when the stones were used.
About 200 S-21-opponents then took an average of 80 kilos of serious Quader with, Stückpreis 6,50 to 14 euros.
As memory, but some in the hope of him on a reconstruction to be able to return.
500 tonnes had Rongen bought 25 large lorry loads.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, Häuslebauer.
From wherever they are and have weggeschleppt what boot and supporters could bear.
The Stuttgart stones of contention have been transformed into "Mäuerle" or in Kräuterbeeten limits.
"This Is really nothing special stone," says Rongen.
"Would not be in the political component."
He is rising in his SUV, makes a tour through his 20 hectares great kingdom.
Jura He has studied and terminated dealers later biology, then he is interested in computers and finally stones.
And stone lovers.
40000 tonnes stored stones he.
From across Germany karrt his treasures.
He says that he is the biggest Altsteinhändler of the Republic.
He is slowing down.
In the snow are skilful behauene sand stones.
"They were once the Dresden Marienbrücke," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he he.
"My Lieblingsstein."
It is the way through the forest.
It shows a bunch: Red limestone, formerly part of the Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful Travertin."
Once belonged to the gallery of the Neckarstadions Stuttgart Quader.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police Bureau, rötlicher stone is complemented with from the cathedral, St. Blasien Tuff from Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what efforts, their sweat.
If Rongen sooner by hand to think about how the stones were being moved and bottles with simple trains and ox cart, he will very reverential.
"It would be a scandal if it would Schreddern."
He is not rich become rich.
But 14 people employed the Steinhändler today, also have high in the forest Steinmetze, a Bildhauer, a blacksmith, a Glasbläser and settled horticulturalists.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," says the Resteverwerter.
Soon he must to Cologne.
There, too, there are obstacles to save.
Talent fight for high-potential
There is a lively crush on Buffett.
16 students are salmon rolls, tomato soup and trick.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen have the machines construction and design students invited to a workshop.
In a kind of competition of ideas should they, together with VW developers on the car of the future jargon - and incidentally Volkswagen.
In the competition for the brightest now many businesses in the Nahkampf and as VW, on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: The smartest graduates as early as possible in the Hörsälen recruit before they enter the job market and other pulled.
And because the universities no data on the performance of their students, tried to publish the exceptional talents in practice projects to erspähen and keep.
On the second day of workshops to do Braunschweig advertises the car company's talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributed pens, wine gum and Mappen with VW logo.
They told the hopeful young talents of training programmes and students jobs and show them ways in the company.
Nico Selle of do Braunschweig cared for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides, "the students are in contact with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can at the same time students, interesting candidates closer at these ratings and think about who would staff in."
Such cooperation, so Selle, are not unusual.
New is that the students will gebuhlt as aggressively.
"otherwise, the emphasis was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates will be even harder.
In many industries companies no longer their employees can choose from a large flock of candidates.
But they must advertise and particularly for highly skilled workers balzen.
Mainly graduates from the engineering disciplines into an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October on 40,000 engineers are vacant.
And the so-called engineer gap, according to VDI-forecasts will be even greater.
For audit and consultancy firm KPMG is novel Dykta on talent hunt.
He organised elaborate Recruiting-events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern, with trails the participants using GPS coordinates must find their way.
Eight promising students to send the company next year across the United States.
Incidentally, can look at the participants KPMG-branches and the company.
Who should decide in two rounds of selection in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies in the United States.
The slashing and burning the high potential in the universities, the artillery according to Dykta widening.
"We want to deal with the Race for the mass."
"Just a simple Segeltörn was not enough for us."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be working.
"We have until now with all participants a similar action last year contact."
"Some are nearing completion and want to compete with us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct Buhlen on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises are also quite classic in professional prowled measure.
"We are trying graduates at a technical measure."
"Around at the inter-solar," reported Sitha Stübe, personnel head for solar technology manufacturers solar World.
The Bonn company employs about 1,500 workers in Germany.
Stübe knows the offspring.
There are currently 35 posts advertised on the company website.
"It is very difficult to fill vakante positions."
"It takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is contact on the Uni-Professoren.
Solar World cooperates with different universities, the University in Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that we work placements or write his thesis."
Expensive advertising actions are not needed for solar specialists.
For trying to promote other benefits for the company: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"This can often do not offer a large corporation," says staff head Stübe.
Money discouraged no longer plays the main role.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are crucial factors.
Solar World documented in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute the 55th place among the 100 best employers.
The institute produces an annual best list German employers.
Asked how satisfied they are with their work and their Jobumfeld and look to the framework conditions for the workers.
Staff from the head Stübe hopes placement also plus points in the Jobsuchenden.
"I think that applicants, especially after external assessments on a potential employers look," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Germans Employer branding Academy advises companies want to build a reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make it attractive to an employer, on their own staff," he says.
In the industry jargon that internal Employer branding, so employers brand education within its own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If its people do well and they identify with the companies, they would automatically to friends and acquaintances to advertise their employers.
"It is a game with a gang," said Kriegler.
Obama stops new drilling
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years there will be no new drilling.
A ban, the government issued in Washington - and their previous plans finally revoked.
New drilling off the Atlantic coast remain banned for now.
This divided Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, at least for the next five years, is the explosion of Bohrplattform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident that claimed the lives of 11 workers and the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had led to pressure from the opposition and the industry his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce US dependence on oil from overseas.
Who bears the responsibility for the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf, is still not finally resolved.
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy group BP, with billions demands.
An investigation commissioned by Obama in the course of 2008 to submit their results.
In October, Home Secretary Ken Salazar the Bohrstopp imposed after the explosion.
In the end have had several oil companies immediately applications for new Bohrvorhaben.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations want Obama and Salazar a fresh disaster.
At present, the competent authority, which was in disrepute, radically reformed after numerous corruption charges.
Obama has announced that lucrative to close tax loopholes for the oil and Gaskonzerne.
The industry warns now publicly that the output in the Gulf by a stricter regulation would be significantly lower than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industry" is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultant BDO - before the Bohrverbot by Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complained the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulatory exactly."
Investment in new projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the river is ölbraun, it looks like the station: billion litres of Ausgelaufenes crude oil have destroyed the natural in Ogoniland in Nigeria.
The people of theft, corruption and illegal Ölkochen.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"You will not be" reassured haunts the eco activist journalists: 'You will still have the lens oily slime enough today. "
The 37-year-old Nigerians has followed the attempt, a until the chest in water watenden boys with the surrounding Schlieren abzulichten: In the regenbogenfarbenen water the scene almost nicely.
That Under the surface brown Rohölschwaden, is not to see.
Previously Have buckets way shrimp collected told Esther Badom on the shores of the Bodo-Jetty river.
Now is the lazy river waters completely dead.
Five years ago, poured from a geborstenen pipeline tons of crude oil in the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby city Bodo must now six hours row to fish containing waters, in the heart of the Niger Delta Ogoniland is one of the worst verpesteten regions of the world.
On the journey through the Flussläufen criss-crossed Mangrovensümpfe is apparent the full extent of the devastation.
Instead water wühlt motor boat brown Brühe on who its hand pops into the water, ölige finger.
The roots of the Mangrovenbäumchen stand out as black Lakritzstangen from the ground, sad I occasionally present palms their Wedel depend.
Vogelschwärme as usual in wetlands are meted: Once the External war remains silent in the former as a filling station riechenden paradise gespenstische calm spreads.
"What happens is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari gloomy: "We live in constant danger for the health."
The war comparison is apt.
The Ogoni settlement is a disputed battlefield for decades: Here, more than 60 years ago, the first Explorateure from Europe, here in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa later executed the first organised resistance here the Shell had to stop his production company in 1993 because it was dangerous for its Ölarbeiter.
Today the company return Ogoniland denied: While across the delta region of triple the size of Switzerland with about 5,000 Bohrquellen and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped more than two million barrels a day of the black gold, oil fields in Ogoniland collapsed, the situation is too unstable to the company.
Every few hundred metres stand out stählerne Gestelle as fanciful sculptures from the water: "Christbäumchen" are the heads of the boreholes much to zärtlich mentioned.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded.
Always breche such a Bohrkopf apart, says Akpobari, then rinne a constant stream of crude oil into the water.
More than two billion litres of the quantity of oil spilled into the ecosystem of the Delta experts estimate in 50 years: Year after year, as the wreck of the super-tanker Exxon Valdez '"21 years into the sea off Alaska became one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the continuing eco-meltdown, it is argued.
While the Shell company sabotage and organised Öldiebstahl blames for more than 90% of the pollution, see environmentalists berstende Bohrköpfe and lecke pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell in Nigeria attach much lower safety standards than elsewhere in the world, accusing the US scientist Richard Steiner, the company of 2008: The rate of defects in the pipes was "considerably higher than elsewhere".
In one place, which from a distance looks like a abandoned oil workshop in the open air, popping from the mangroves characters: Cluster naked and They are up to our necks ölverschmiert.
Among the many barrels, which are partly linked tubes, partly arbitrary scattered on the site to identify future has come a fire: An illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, crude oil on the fire several hours fervid, says Michael, the head of the group.
First insist petrol through the pipes in the Auffangtopf later spits at the end of the pipeline, kerosene and diesel.
So produce Michael and four staff on a daily basis up to four barrels of diesel à 300 litres: "It brings us 34,000 Naira a" - around 22 dollars.
The delta residents use the chronic fuel shortages in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The Ridiculously low with just 40 euro cents per litre diesel price can undercut the illegal Kocher: Because its resource get it for free.
He comes from "Bunkerern 'pipeline network across Ogoniland tap: Go to the country, according to experts in the entire Niger day lost at least 16 million litres of crude oil.
Only a tiny part of the provisionally between raw material stored illegally fashioned methods, however: The lion's share will fill organised criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military tankers and in command on the world market.
The debate is whether the environmental disaster due to the activities of the population or the lax production of activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"The oil companies would not perceived as invaders and they would have the livelihood of the fishermen not so thoroughly destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
Now is the relationship of the Ogoni especially Shell but destroyed so that only a withdrawal of the group in question would be: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese stand out as better."
As Michael nervous.
"High time that it disappears," says the muskulöse put.
"Every minute, the soldiers can come."
The illegal Ölveredler of the special forces are caught, they are not arrest, but a painful bribes.
The mainly hail from the north - as all Nigerians - from the raw material benefit.
"This damn toys has brought our country in every respect to the dog," says Akpobari.
Investigators discover hazardous construction defects in A380-engines
The A380 is obviously a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a notgelandeten machine a possible construction defects in the investigation, which could lead to a "catastrophic failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturers.
The passengers of the notgelandeten Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November had appears to be much more by luck than previously known: The Australian Aviation safety authorities in their investigation a major security problem with the engines of the A380 aircraft - and now warns against a possible construction defects.
The potential defect could have serious consequences: A Ölschlauchverbindung he could produce, it said in a statement published on this Thursday, the authority ATSB.
This could lead to "a catastrophic failure".
Affected by Rolls-Royce engines produced in 20 A380 aircraft-series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, on 4 November notlanden in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now begun legal action against the British turbine manufacturers.
They submitted a statement to the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, the him further legal action against the company.
Qantas-chef Alan Joyce said that his airline would demand compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire engine had solved sections and damaged the wings.
A Rolls Royce oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident must now be changed to 40 engines worldwide.
The Australian researchers announced that further safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected train stations.
The safety recommendation was the result of a cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After The emergency evacuation of the Qantas-Maschine, the airline had its A380 fleet for weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines has about three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa changed in an A380 as a precautionary measure, the train.
The doppelstöckige flyer is the world's largest passenger airliner.
National snowfall solves transport chaos from
Germany is almost entirely in White: Overnight snow fell throughout the country.
On many roads, trains and planes fall out.
In car accidents at least three people died.

Thousands of dead mate
More than 10,000 people have been designed in New Zealand the verschütteten miners, after a number of explosions in a mine declared dead.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation is precarious Unglücksschacht further.
Just two weeks ago it was in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth came to a violent explosion.
29 miners underground aged between 17 and 62 were killed.
A tube was in the Unglücksschacht hinabgelassen, but there is no sign of survivors.
The high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions for security reasons were
After the second blasts were the authorities and experts assumed that there was no more chance of survival for mates.
The bodies have not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends with a commemorated reminiscent of the deaths.
Ten thousand people had gathered in Greymouth radioactive sunshine at the New Zealand Südinsel.
They remained silent for Two minutes.
In honor of the verschütteten miners were 29 tables, at which helmets, lamps and the names of the sidekick.
Pictures and personal belongings, including clothing and Surfbretter, found their place here.
Before flying The flags on government buildings in the country halbmast.

Rescue workers started a fire inside the coal plant on the South Island of New Zealand to erase.
Once the explosive gases will be ousted, started the fervent temperatures inside the mine, said police herunterzukühlen President Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, warriors.
Splatter fits the art of cinema?
The director Nicolas winding Refn testing with his fighters-epic "Walhalla Rising" old genre-borders.
In what may the Danish director Nicolas winding Refn have thought, as he "Walhalla Rising" has?
A captured Vikings-warriors with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) freed themselves from his Peinigern and places with almost superhuman powers rushed his opponents - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody Action, precisely because our hero like rough killing methods and its enemies to Gedärme leap from the vibrant limb when he has bad-tempered.
On the other hand, says Einauge, as it is called, the whole film about a word, and the other characters can at most be to one or two sentences or a few painful death shouting.
Otherwise, kept silence and in the gruselig fine Hügellandschaft Scotland geschwelgt, the Wikingerwelt offers of around a thousand years ago the scene.
Ideal more for adult Cineasten with interest for Existentialismus and very calm camera journeys.
Well, if a film has several target groups, it is a pity if they are mutually exclusive.
Orchestrator winding Refn applies since his wild and gestylten drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically, his works with a little more mainstream humour or a little less brutality the Arthouse accessible.
Most art cinema-friends are around the spritzenden brain mass and the Gedärmen deterred.
The Action-fans will die from boredom, if Einauge from free interpretierbaren reasons with a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship after Jerusalem arousing popular and is an eternity in the doldrums and fog before the team arrives in America and there remains silent.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany has found no cinema-distribution and now only on DVD.
This is particularly the magnificent pictures a shame, but also because, behind the prätentiösen until bluttriefenden facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In This film is not about dialogues or a stringent action, it is all atmosphere, a film a fever dream.
And there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn takes him barely a moment of détente and drawn him with his icy images and the dark drift-like sound track very slowly cut the throats, but above all with the incredible hatred of him from the heart of the characters.
Only a small blonder boy, the Einauge faithful, retains a presumption that all others are driven by anger.
The vast majority of the one-eyed man hero whose motives are never explained, but may be ambassador for enemies and temporary allies will eventually warriors from the hell of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for the Verdorbenen anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is an unexplained film you hate and admire, upset and annoyed, gee.
An experience.
Mysterious Erdarbeiten
The Atomic Energy authority IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country refuses to comment - nor is it controls.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 fighter planes, a mysteriöses würfelförmiges building in Syria.
It is on the banks of the Euphrates, the next major city 30 miles away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents, when it comes to the reactor, Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the Quader has hidden in a valley by the electricity.
According to a briefing of the US-Auslandsgeheimdienstes CIA by the end of April 2008 would also under the name of the nearby town of el-Kibar normal reactor have been well suited to produce plutonium - to build nuclear weapons.
For other purposes against the technology from the fifties.
The CIA ran a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By Computeranimation ignored it, where the components of the reactor before the destruction, a verkleinerte copy of North Korea model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
Moreover, it presented photographs that show the buildings from near or even interior space.
The reactor was briefly stood before the operation, it said, but not yet with pellets peppers.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more than it was then known, the mystery with time rather bigger.
Former US President George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA before the attack was fairly sure that Syria in al-Kibar a reactor built, but hardly saw evidence that it was in the country, "an active nuclear weapons programme '.
Some intelligence officers in Europe are even more cautious and only talk of a 'alleged reactor, "even if the CIA presentation for" plausible ".
You lack of hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how confident he was to have a reactor, said a senior UN diplomat in summer only flat, the IAEA "has enough material to ask questions".
The ruins of the alleged "unused military building" surpassed the Syrians eager aside and planierten thoroughly premises.
However, in June 2008 a IAEA-Team under the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
Moreover, the IAEA on a Member State satellite images of commercial providers the period immediately after the attack, which might be more powerful than the CIA.
However, these recordings on the market, not because of the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - it has bought exclusive.
The IAEA can therefore not independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that never operated a secret nuclear program or to have built a reactor.
The uranium come from the Israeli weapons, said Damascus.
But the IAEA to analyse the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss - as well as on the satellite images.
Inspectors also denied a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the rubble of bombed-out building.
But Israel says pugnaciously.
"We will never comment on," said recently at the time of the attack acting Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's official position.
Dragging the investigation of the case since June 2008 and fruitless "is becoming a serious credibility problem for the authority, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna gives - after all, is a grave violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the area, about IAEA watchdog.
As a key to progress in the investigation to the IAEA apparently sees three more bodies, "functional link" with the alleged reactor And this still exist.
The inspectors have not disclosed what plants are, or what they are or what they seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung they are in the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan Masyaf and Iskandariayah described, in turn, derived from nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and on a complex in Masyaf, in which it is most probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is probably in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this justification denied Syria IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a rather than fishing expedition - that the IAEA by the United States will vorgeschickt auszuspähen military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives were the result of a tip of the US intelligence services on the institutions closely.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the Euphrates Quader material was moved back and forth.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could "in connection with the fuel production".
But there were "no evidence of sensitive activities," uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor will not enriched uranium, which is.
But where the uranium could have come from and where it later the plutonium for the bomb should be separated on these central issues there are plausible conjecture.
It is also unclear whether other debris that could bring valuable traces stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of lorry loads of disappeared, nobody wants information about where the rubble.
Only a few kilometers from al-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, salt mine al-Tibni Syria 1998 to investigate its suitability as a camp for radioactive waste, the IAEA as unlikely.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had it in a recent analysis of satellite images for the venerable magazine Jane's Intelligence Review associated with the reactor.
Footage from the orbiting but show that Syria to the three suspect sites Erdarbeiten and large container, after the IAEA access had requested.
That cannot be coincidence, but has hardly helped dispel the suspicion.
It is also stated In diplomatic circles, have spent many months to develop a plan for inspections of the IAEA, which should allow Syria to safeguard any military secrets - alone shows how much interest the inspectors is the effort.
Meanwhile, Damascus bügelte this proposal too.
Western diplomats in Vienna had a year ago assuaged, the reactor was destroyed, therefore, have no high urgency, brings the matter around US Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months called special inspections into the game, one of the harshest means the Vienna nuclear authority to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, these inspections should propose, has already spoken of a "option, for which I am open in the future", but even he is hesitant.
It is a high risk in this way: It needs for a majority On the board of the IAEA, and many of the 35 countries represented are anything other than eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat recalled: "What if they end up nothing?
Dear in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie in the summer with the work on her still nameless Regiedebüt begun, there is anger.
The script, she has written a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We know a lot more about it - but that is enough for unrest.
The rumour persists, the woman, a Muslim, Verliebe during the war in Yugoslavia their Serbian rapists.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, and some in Sarajevo planned Drehtage short term were transferred to Hungary.
The film is marginalised in Hungary and is now in the post-production, but it will still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic female war victims wrote about the organisation of the UN refugee agency UNHCR of Jolie and requesting for a meeting with the actress, now a Bosnian newspaper has reported, Jolie is itself ambassador of UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerks.
Diplomatically, it is not - the women weeks she has been a meeting in Hungary, which offered but rejected.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not been, and Jolie attitude towards the victims betraying her enough on the script.
According to the UN refugee agency has recommended their organisation, Jolie as Ambassador to dismiss, told the Guardian.
But what exactly has Jolie for scenes written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, the their script to read, has given a Drehgenehmigung for Sarajevo - it is not clear why after some to-ing and still not occurred.
The young author even claimed that they have no political intentions with their film, with great effort, incorporated into the Yugoslav conflict has wanted to show the terrible consequences of the war and all of the parties involved a voice.
The content, however, remains vague.
So too a second Synopsis on film in the network, which sounds pretty different: Loving knew already war break out and when they meet again, a Bosnian Muslim, abducted in a Serbian Camp, where he works as a vigil.
What sounds is significantly different than the variant "rape victims verknallt torturer".
Jolie film actually begins before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, as Jolie, was "unfair and is based on misinformation."
They can give their well only the hackers from Hollywood peace: By now the script, as so many before it, illegally put on the network.
Nothing like away here
On this evening is finally right again around for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For the home team dominated his guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans johlen with joy in krachend loud music, they scratch with the feet.
The Bailey-pub in south Cork, Ireland, because the players table tennis balls on a three-metre distance in beer mug throw - and meetings.
"Beer pong" refers to the bizarre spectacle to win there is EUR 500 victory premium plus tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm type; this shrill Trinkspiel and restrained IT professionals, not really fits together.
And the 26-year-olds tried to divert amusement, the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will hold talks in New Zealand in January application.
"I have a mulmiges feeling about this," he says.
"It is so far away from home and I have no work there."
After all: his girlfriend waiting in Auckland of him, "she had ruck, flash their Wunschjob as Eventmanagerin, may be a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of poor prospects at home have been two of Tanners three Geschwistern their luck abroad.
His sister, Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys: As with the Tanners looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the next period, say experts, the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015 they even with 200,000 immigrants.
For this small country of only 4.5 million people a severe loss.
The predictions come true, there is a wave of emigration, comparable with those suffered from Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of boom, is now again sadness for the Irish great prosperity.
The economic crisis, particularly the young, well-educated, Irish, for which it has only uphill.
Jobverlust and social decline during the boom years seemed absurd.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
But now three of ten men and women under 30 without work.
In the Irish Times, there are loads Leserbriefe young immigrants, the lament: "Everything is in Ireland going down the drain".
"It should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can lose away and our country as a whole generation."
"The last power then ask the light '.
Jura-student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish students Union, sees a bright future, because the government only window dressing and the young people no longer offer prospects.
"They reduce the minimum wages, but they have no strategy, as new jobs," says the 20-year-olds.
They watched as their counterparts from an unpaid internship next indulging.
Their main concern, she says, be it in four years to emigrate themselves.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Try men as Stephen McLarnon there are positive.
McLarnon organised the "WorkingAbroadExpo," a mass on the subject of a general service to work abroad.
"For young people is the work abroad but a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," said the manager.
On its website and show photographs site in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not a Galeerendienst but also freedom and fun.
As it inspires elsewhere to build White Seán O Donovan for half a year.
Because there was anything more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In Genselkirchen they just a fashion house.
In January it goes on Hanover or Berlin, the next project.
His country is O Donovan now only rarely because he makes extra layers of the credit for his house at home abbezahlen.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, as he after a long time, for the first time on the threshold of his home.
"I should have money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I am never more."
He laughs and goes through something ausgekühlte areas.
The small house is in a neighborhood with fine leafy front gardens, in the park Einfahrten huge, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O Donovan the House for four years ago bought for EUR 380 000 - 100 per cent credit-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Does He fears that it could go wrong with the credit?
O Donovan thought for a while, adding hot tea and says: "I have no children, which I must feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start anew."
Currently, a civil engineer may not wailing that he often hears.
"No one should starve, our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, this is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we feel only when Irish."
He laughs and told of his father, the last big economic crisis to England.
"After seven years, he was back and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner like this idea.
The future simply beg and see how it goes with the life elsewhere.
A few years working in London he is already behind in New Zealand and why it should not go well for him and his girlfriend?
One thing is there but still, in these days it properly concerned: The celebration on his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears that it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Not too many emotions," he says and drink a great Schluck of his beer.
"Farewell, that sounds scary."
"We call it a Weggehparty, very loosely, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
The demokatrische routine
The movement for democracy in Latin America will be stronger, such as the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results came the Latinobarómetro survey carried out in 18 countries and exclusively was published in The Economist.
This survey is being carried out regularly since 1995 and shows that the change in this region.
Two facts in this year's survey in September and October, particularly in's eye.
First, the good mood in Latin America
And secondly the growing interest in democracy and its key institutions.
In many countries of the South American Pacific coast has greatly increased the democratic movement (so table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy is growing at approximately 6% year since 2002, the number of democracy advocates of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
In Mexico, where the economy since the onset last year recovered, is such a trend.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries of the region, are what the regional average cuts (so Diagram 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said that they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice. The same as last year, 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are those of last year, but show a sharp increase from 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago undermined efforts to Latin America's economic crisis, more democracy.
Also during the global economic crisis lasted perhaps is that the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief recession and a speedy recovery.
Moreover, the poor absorbed by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America only slightly and is again this year fell by 32%.)
But there is strong mood from country to country differences (so diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread Fortschrittsdenken.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession mount and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only the second time since the poll began many respondents in Latin America in a bigger problem than crime in their country in the unemployment (5).
Some 31% say that either they or a family member last year were victims of a crime. But declined the values and 38% last year, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the greater support from the private and the market economy: around 71% of respondents on regional said that the private sector is essential for the development, in 2007 there were 56% (6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy their country can bring progress, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela this view maintained (and 80% are for a private sector), even though its left-wing President, Hugo Chávez, many private companies.
Brazil has the biggest influence in the region last year, according to 19% of respondents (18%), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, and this role in the Dominican Republic of Venezuela and Nicaragua.
An electoral defeat
No one had expected that the elections on 28 November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts exceeded the fears of election workers, the beleaguered country who rushed to help.
Overflowing ballot boxes, several votes cast, election notes in Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problem.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were displaced by the earthquake in January off around in search of a choice.
Finally, Some gave all.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged tops, because of alleged fraud in the election results.
There was some violent protests throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, the election "as well in many contexts."
According to a cautious statement of observers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities, as seriously as they may be, the process is not necessarily unlawful".
In other words, the "goes on.
The electoral authority, the supposedly the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jew Célestin, is obliged, will announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity proceedings.
If Célestin Jewish voters, with little or no support from the Wahlberhörde declared the winner of the runoff, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims are still living in tents, was a low turnout predictions.
On election day, many Haitians by poor organisation of the vote.
Shortly before election beginning approximately 250,000 cards, which are needed on the election, were not distributed.
There is much at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognised as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
Haitians are of the same opinion.
In the middle of secretly
In the weeks after the sudden death of your man told Argentina's President Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, their popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. This is the highest level since her election in 2007.
But whether its a re-election next year, it depends on whether the visibly trauernde Cristina Fernández is further compromises as her late husband, Néstor Kirchner, her predecessor and political partner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, even after the election, his wife economic policy, was often budget plans, the tax revenue, economic growth and inflation not fully into account.
This allowed the couple to spend the extra revenue as they see fit.
On paper, the Fernández-government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchners death after a heart attack on 27 October, leading to further Zerwürfnissen.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronisten were behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where a Member of Parliament another in the face, and other proposed the government policy of corruption), the Congress, the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss," the President.
The 2010 budget applies now for the next year, which the President has more opportunity to spend money as they see fit.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is z.Z. at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - up to almost 30%.
Kirchner took office in 2003, when Argentina was beset by economic crisis, said growth and poverty reduction to its main objectives, and not reduce inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, has singled out for bullying as the private sector and säuberte the National Institute for Statistics and census INDEC, prompting the official inflation statistics schönte.
Fernández Now can we take?
It has business and union leaders called for talks.
And According to official wage increases should be limited to 18% next year.
The high world prices for Argentina's agricultural products have a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps to Cristina Fernández why Argentina financial economically back to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government had rejected a previous refinancing agreement with shareholders of the country in 2001.
Fernández Now appears on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have had a review by the IMF, as usual elsewhere, always rejected.
But last month, the economy minister, Amado Boudou, announced that the Fund in the drafting of a new national consumer price index "technical assistance". It looks as if this is the first step to clean up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández after leaving office without the support of her husband politically active.
If so, it needs to get the support of the middle class, which largely enough by Kirchnerism.
If the Argentinians will return from their summer holidays, in March the wave of Sympatie she was shown abgeebbt.
If they win another election, she must decide whether they would many political decisions of their man quietly lifted.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are nearing slowly closer link to the mainland.
What does his big brother across the Straits of Taiwan?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters are 70% of the electorate, in the five city mayors and city councils. This will be a broad assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building a cutting-edge business relations, einschl. of a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for relations with the mainland. Its policy, the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949 lasting changes.
Ma has the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party, three of the five mayors, it received a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which supports greater Taiwanese independence, almost 50% of the votes, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election would mean for Ma problems.
Since his election two years ago, the percentage of his party about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in town councils.
During the election, there was the usual events in Taiwan as truck convoys with Krawallmachern, flag-shift end mass parades and only scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT made a speech at a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When he was a man from the crowd schoß. LIEN wounded and a umstehender spectators were killed.
Bizarre wiser is not clear whether the shooter Lien kill or wanted to settle a dispute with the candidates.
Regardless of the attack, according to Tsai mine-whom, the leader of the DPP, the election and the DPP in a bad light, what the KMT has brought more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winners of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated on plans to housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For This reason, the KMT their relations with the government in Beijing
But this time avoiding the DPP, the anti-Chinese sentiment to stir up too much.
They responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma in turn would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese its China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to attract Taiwan with economic incentives in the Community.
China sent a negotiator to Taipei, immediately prepare for a summit to investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wants a political integration. But the most important thing first.
It is thus prefer waiting until after the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP has since reinvented.
Two years ago it was severely weakened: Former party leader Chen Shui-bian sat in jail for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 until 2008, he was strongly for the absolute independence.
But under Tais reign has developed a new generation gemässigter politicians and the DPP is fighting the votes of professionals and young people.
Tsai took place as the presidential candidate of the DPP große approval, such as Su Tseng-Chang Chen.
Their party is doing everything now, to show that it is capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China, but open-minded discussion.
Tsai stated publicly that their party a "trustworthy alternative 'offer to Mas vorschneller rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell, he said, the candidate of the DPP would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He called the pragmatists Su even to forego the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's intervention does the DPP hard to choose their possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidate wanted their campaign without him.
The main reason for his unpopularity unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
According to the statement of one KMT-Sprechers it will be cabinet and the local facilities.
The strong performance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is a rapprochement only limited support.
While most Taiwanese economic cooperation with China see as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return."

The Secret Societ wild Steampunk-musician Darcy James argue, in the category of large group received deserved attention. He is thus against Billy Childs Emsemble with his Kammer-Jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life Ablum "pathways" a good example of a Bassisten than democratic band leader.

Mosque in Temecula wins approval of the planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula took place after a five hours of often heated public hearing the unanimous commitment of local planning committee.
Critics accused the project to promote both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre local rules and will be an aesthetic catch.
"The project is being supported by many good people - from Christians, Jews, Baha'is, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As Americans makes me proud."
"It shows that there is justice."
"There are only a few opponents," he added.
"They are just very loud."
"In this valley are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18: 00 and discussions for and against the construction of the centre went on until almost midnight, and the voices on both sides, according to the Press-Enterprise were fairly evenly distributed.
The debate was on the website of newspaper further.
"There is no longer America," a comment.
"It is a different planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example, in the near Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 11 September 2001.

They should around 17.500 3,162 large land Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents of the council can still appeal against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien variety, including arsenic can live opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth, and elsewhere
Although scientists this unusual bacterium here on earth, it is their view, a sign that a life without the hitherto considered vital elements is possible.
"This organism has two options."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"That makes it a very particular reason, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' way of life is," said Paul C.W. Davies of the Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
So far, six main elements were regarded as vital - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists figured out, there is a growing bacterium in the Californian mono Lake even further if it phosphorus replaced by arsenic.
"One wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for außerirdischem life, as scientists and his life forms must recognise Anbar.
The study deals microbes have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details were given to the discovery, led to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report by the discovery Außerirdischen life could act.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that organisms in other planet systems, with the help of other elements biochemical processes can set in motion and that the 'standard', which we believe are absolutely vital, not necessarily elements are imposed," according Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute held University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research teams.
"This work is a first, because it shows that in fundamental biochemical processes and structures element can be replaced by another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from Astrobiologischen NASA Institute, who chaired the study, chose the mono Lake because of the high arsenic levels.
Since arsenic and phosphorus chemically identical, that microbes that both are exposed, perhaps they can replace an element from the other.
"The toxicity of the Arsens is based mainly on the fact that it is chemically similar as organaphosphorous."
"By the organisms find it hard to distinguish, an element from the other."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic different than phosphorus. it in our biochemisches system, where it covered almost everything," says Anbar.
The researchers used the bacterium GFAJ-1 rising arsenic concentration from It suited to and grew.
The microbe is growing phosphorus better, but that they also can survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can happen, of course, either on the ground or another planet or moon on the arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, is the idea that phosphorous can be replaced by arsenic, not new, But so far there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic came in the early Erdjahren more, it says, is why the science assumed that early life forms have used it.
"There is reason to believe that life can also have developed differently than in the early Erdzeitalter," Forster, not members in Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National health authorities.

The lion brüllt again after judicial authorisation of MGM-restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM now finally given the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge began on Thursday offiziel '"Gläuberplan, the debt of $5 billion to repay the 86-year-old entertainment companies to pave the way for new films and TV shows.
According to the statements Thursday the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass entertainment, nothing more. Barber and Birnbaum are the slightly slimmed-down studio as CEO.
Staff numbers will be reduced to around 320 by over 400.
For MGM enters Chapter 11 only when JPMorgan Chase a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM-productions has concluded.
At the moment is leading a consortium of the investment bank, which brings in $75 million, the company. The funding to by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studios began in May 2009 with the mission of the investment bank Moelis & Co, the management of companies with interest payments of $300 million per year, the solution to their financial problems.
In August, the manager Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert, through his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts became known.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper, the financial worries to solve MGMs and more than 140 Gläuber of studios auszubezahlen, lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties at the end of 2009, the company decided to buy.
But the auction drew only a few bidders and nobody wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything over as the MGM-Team began with the restructuring plan, after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM officially has overcome bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper for their work a bonus of several million dollars.
The share for Moelis & Co. already have received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million
Cooper, who were paid $375.000 monthly for the management of the company, received a $4 million "success bonus"
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio just a film and produced a year plan with seven or eight films in cinemas should come in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million to $275 million for its financial contribution to these two movies, directed by Peter Jackson will result.
The investor Carl Icahn, approximately 18% of the MGM-loan financing, sought a merger of the studios with Lions gate entertainment, whose largest shareholder is.
But the final negotiations between the two companies led to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gifts budget in balance
This year's favourite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect Videokonsole. Both games can be a great hole in your Geschenkebudget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX-wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game around 10 classic Spring rush or approximately 48 doses Play-Doh.
But you can protect your Geschenkebudget.
I recently visited in search of three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys' R 'Us and a BJ's Wholesale club.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has entered into force. This year, the technology toys are efficient and cost less than last year.
And while fewer new toys with its own website, is the best known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, improved supply.
There are more and more button-cell-powered toys on the market, and many of them contain wiederaufladbare batteries.
Here are a few suggestions.
(Unless otherwise indicated, are all prices of toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for children from the age of 3 years) are Plüschfiguren, as big as sea pig that if you sing a note on its belly.
Even push meets a note by mehrmaliges flick you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Respect: If you with the pressing started, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of Gesand and dancing is the Dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60 for children, 2) the best choice.
On the basis of last year developed Elmo Live technology offers the animatronische doll recantations as' Simon says' and, thanks to the new interface feet with Radblockierung dominated the moon-Walk.
Children who tested the machine use Mickey as a dance teacher, but Their parents complained about the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized Lernspielzeuge.
Now he is back (Hasbro / play Kool, $40, for children from the age of 3), with a whole bunch of issue cards with a car journey to a teaching can be, with a preached with car-function as a teacher.
If you want to entrust your child Smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and benutzerfreundlichste solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The Games, however, are not as instructive as contained in the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12 after Leapfrogs), the first major revision of the Leapster-Reihe is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
The versions not compatible with older cassettes.
IXL from Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3 to 7) for the Games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD-card plant family photographs can also be seen.
Finally, there is still Scrabble flash ($30 of Hasbro, for children from the age of 8). the five bloc are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED-Bildschirm.
At stake is the blocks words together, before the time. It is great to improvise a Buchstabierwettbewerb.
More and more toys have a kind of online link.
If you are on offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For your child an online animal in Club Penguin, you can, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 'mix' match figures package ($5 for children 6-12) buy a coin with a secret code.
If you have the code online your child in Club Penguin Store enough bill for two other parts.
The animal can roll shoes or a Puffle-hydrogen.
The latest Kopfzellen-betriebene Mikroroboter, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children 5) is larger than the head of your toothbrushes.
The Käfer moves quickly to 12 vibrierenden silicone legs in any direction.
It makes fun to send him through a maze Klötzen.
And he does something.

Police operations in China Soft
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin on an urban place, revised his nervous subordinates and gave it with military authority and depressed voice commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust Wächtern of urban planning, despised and feared for their indiscriminate raids and their tendency to violence - impress the viewers.
"Just!"
"look ahead!"
"Them" to show It to them, "as beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, hardly the teenage age has outgrown, with white gloves and identical olivegrünen jackets and trousers were closed.
Four pairs of black pumps were in gerader series.
Four proper hats were perfect on the blue-white gestreiften ribbons held hair.
"For me, They see an average from," said Mr Tang disparagingly.
"role Models are nicely."
Several governments have already tried to the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong province led instead of the grey Greens a leuchtend blue uniforms.
Wuhan in central China violence replaced by Dutch rigid: 2009 skittered on reportedly 50 officials a properly established Imbisswagen and gaze at the operator, until this after half an hour einpackte and left the room.
Xindu district in Chengdu, a city with 680.000 inhabitants, would fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women reinforce the urban police. They were special because of their appearance, their good character and her youth.
They should give the police a softer, femininen aspect.
But unfortunately there would also be Scarlett Johan Karlsson hardly manage to improve the bad image that the Chinese have squads of this city.
With critics, right.
Unlike the police these officials should the urban laws only with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008 in Hubei Province officials beat a bystander to death as this them with his mobile phone while filming, as a protest against a dumping ground.
Last year a training manual of Beijing officials stolen and posted on the Internet and described as criminals without bloodshed can be beaten.
This year, comprised a Shanghai Wassermelonenhändler five officials after a Handgemenge with brain injuries.
A violent video game strotzendes that can be downloaded from the Internet shows in China trained officials in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguan frightens the government," lamentierte national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper called a "really '.
Skeptics are the current approach is clearly inadequate.
As the Distrik in October by advert eight female recruits, was an editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question whether the women had real tasks or just an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to screen women aged 18 to 22, with good character and "harmonious face trains'.
They should be abnormally large - on 1,5m or 5 foot 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with achieving the 26 year life.
According to the officials is the work of women over 25 physically demanding.
"The most important is their image," was a unbenannter district official with the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates to get the job, first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, features, etc."
Then temperament and "inner qualities".
"Female Chengguan are put," he said, and added, "but they also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the city administration of the southern, would not agree this description
But that, in China, sizes targets advertisements for both sex are not unusual.
The same is true for regular features.
Whether it is synonymous with good looks, is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical changes need not apply.
"Here we can unfortunately not leading or use Buckligen," Mr Zheng.
"Their image would not be good."
Liu Yi, on the Baoguang Square near a monastery patroliert, 22, has Apfelbäckchen and a historic moment.
They do not empfindetes as sexist that such great value is placed on their appearance.
"You find, I see in this uniform sexy?" Asks them with ironischem look.
Her colleague with the Grübchen, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task, the image of the city."
According to Their regret the short position, because they have more ambitious career plans than simply dealers through the alleys to prosecute, to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the some remarks with around 12 street traders who try to walk or bike as many rolls and Tofugerichte, continuing to sell before they are hunted.
"Mr Wang, disappear here."
"We have said this to you so often!" said Frl. Xu a dealer who fled on foot and was at a Fahrradkarre pair Nudelküche temporarily abandoned.
According to the officials of the work rather monotonous as demanding.
"It is the same thing almost every day," says Huang Jing, 20, in their free time studying distribution system.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials must not, as her male colleagues, confiscate goods traders.
They can only threaten to notify their superiors male offenders.
That should protect them from public hostility, officials in China often are exposed.
This year, rioted outside hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, after the rumour kursierte Chengguan officers had a traffickers killed.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the incident at night, 14 government vehicles were undermined or set on fire.
Xindu remained free of such violent incidents.
But riots are not.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials this morning patroulierten, about 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had a motorcycle confiscated, contrary to the rules on the pavement, rather than in a garage been repaired.
The owner of cried hue and cry.
After 15 minütigem hesitation gave officials with cruel point the way to their cars and drove with the motorcycle and his owners.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male some remarks, remained. In this capacity he white shield to remain anonymous.
As their colleagues the coordinators - men over 40 - a supporting role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we verbally."
"Sometimes but also physically," says Mr Li calmly.
"Most of the time, the people with the dispute."
Prosecutor will Senator Ensign not accuse
The Justice Department Prosecutors have Senator John Ensign acquitted of charges after his affair with a former Wahlhelferin and his attempt to her husband a lobbying against him, the lawyers of the senator on Wednesday.
That decision ended the worst legal success against Senator Ensign, a Republican from Nevada. Up to the scandal, the nationwide for headlines and his career a damper, he was seen as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns office announced that he was pleased about the decision following the one-year investigation.
The ethics committee of the Senate, however, could impose a Disziplarstrafe.
According to the Ensigns lawyers, the Justice Ministry informed that the investigations against Senator Ensign have been stopped and that in this matter no more charges.
The Justice Ministry did not comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In its opinion, there was sufficient evidence that the lobbying Ensign prohibition.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times were made public, gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of its election agents to lucrative contracts, in order to buy his silence over an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was during an election campaign Ensigns worked as treasurer.
Ensign, contact some political friends to Hampton work. According to the records and interrogation he assumed for them after the recruitment Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton recently in Ensigns election team, it was he was not lobbying for a year for his former employer or the whole Senate.
According to the statement by ethics experts in the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, before the affair were chummy, against the so-called ban the revolving door-Lobbykratie.
According to the published evidence "is apparently a consultation and the violation of the revolving door-statutes, Stanley fire, a Washington lawyer who has the defence of clients specialising in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Department officially rejected it, the reasons for the decision in the Ensign-known case, said Mr. fire and other ethics lawyers, the ministry seems very cautious in rather political charges after a lot of defeat by the media with great interest, including the decision last year that the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens because of misconduct by the prosecutor to drop.
Prosecutors "are obviously scared detention," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the association, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington "(an organisation whose aim is to combat corruption in parliamentary and government circles in the United States), a group of lawyers, the various charges against Mr. Ensign has brought to court.
"That basically means that a high government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, main defenders of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday, a prosecutor and a further the next day, in which he was told that the Ministry will raise no complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns defenders had cooperated with prosecutors, in order to convince them that the senator, as his office, in a statement on Wednesday again repeated, "in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to explain the legal arguments it had made with prosecutors.
"I am not well in the conversation details between me and the Ministry of Justice. Just say this much: we believe the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate complaint with the ethics group, after a payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensigns parents to the Hamptons against the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, the length of time senator, was one of the firms, in which Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists working.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company Mr. Hampton has got as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings chief of staff, John Lopez, in which he told him that he had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, the Interior Ministry for a cause "anklopfe."
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and one other customers from Nevada, Allegiant Air, agreed to lunch and asked the transport Minister, a meeting on behalf of the airline to agree after Mr. Hampton to lobby had stopped.
Last year, for the first time information to the public on this affair Medellín, Mr. Ensign to apologise to his constituents and gave his position in the Senate, where he had been in the Republican rank in fourth place.
Many months After he was no longer struck two weeks ago, Mr. Ensign told reporters that he seek a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign may no longer be the target of police investigations, said his press spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper, the senator hope that the Ethics committee will very quickly follow the example of the Justice Ministry and its investigations.
"Senator Ensign looks forward to his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada to continue," she said.
Cheshire-appeal calls attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tippten in the riots in the courtroom.
The minutes-stroke verschickten via Twitter their reports on grey cent testimonies.
In the end, the defence, there have been more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process for rape and beds gekettete children in a house that flare.
On Thursday, the process will be closely followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, killed an official end, if the find on the death sentence, the panel has ruled.
But Mr. Hayes lawyers have already submitted applications to court, explain the reasons for an appeal and the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that it through intensive reporting on the process, even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - a "circus atmosphere" and such a widespread, swift penetration rebel details, so that the jury was improperly influenced by the public indignation.
This objection Appelationsgerichte could lead to deal with the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the court.
"As I have seen it during this process, I believe that it really is a danger, if the arrival of the new technologies in the courtroom influenced the individual right to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes main defenders.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue chamber of the Supreme Court, rejected the applications by referendum succinctly last week when he said that the new media would be "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that the jury had been driven by passion.
But this was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, a court found that the reporting of notorious cases doubt the fairness of the process.
In his historic decision in 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States the ruling against Dr Sam Sheppard, a osteopaths from Cleveland, killed his wife, and said in its decision that a "Karnevalsatmosphäre in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV show and the movie "On the flight" based on this crime.
Some lawyers say, court judgments, which Mr. Hayes condemnation half a century later, could follow the lead of the argument that new rules are necessary for the communication from the courtroom at the time of the fall Dr Sheppard were unimaginable.
"There is a good reason to be worried about the impact of new media in processes that will be followed by a broader public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. according to his report, they arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said, some Appelationsgerichte could be fascinated by the idea that restricting a prompt communication from inside the courtroom could make the process fair.
The Twitter issue is just one of many, the lawyers of Mr. Hayes explain to discuss years and thus delaying a condemnation.
The defenders claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes has already been explanation as judge Blue could not allow them to test the reaction of potential judges giving them during the Jurorenauswahl grey cent scene photos showed.
Some of the judges said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-petit, 48 years, and their Tüchter, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years, they would have met with disgust.
The defenders say that they are also called into question the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argue that the judge mistakenly a jury have exchanged views, a critic of the department, and that he was improperly exerted pressure on the ruling, as he had taken the unusual decision, the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of the extensive reporting on the process is perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment appeals they have submitted last month, they made that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and during the election campaign for the office of the governor and for the American Senate candidate was discussed.
They argued that the new media continually re-igniting the flames of emotion on the case.
"Such a daily crush of Medienpiepser, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," wrote lawyers' has previously in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide has not yet seen. "
Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are rabble-rousing but slower than the reports will be reimbursed, a technology hostile view is reporting on future processes verarme.
However, some lawyers said, Appelationsgerichte would often faced with the argument that social and technological changes requires the Adaptation through the courts.
Mr. Hayers lawyers reinforce this assertion.
In their appeal to the Supreme Court of 1966, in the condemnation of Dr Sheppard due to the coverage has been lifted and made it clear that the new media, new rules require.
"This case," they wrote, 'Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. "
Can combine courtesy that divides us?
After a campaign to Schimpfwörtern and negativity is little courtesy erupted in Washington this week.
It is the sign of a genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion, before we quickly back to fight the parties in the capital returns?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and leaders of Congress produced no breakthrough on the big issues, while the so-called "lame duck session," the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no decisions to be taken.
After all, what we hear, it has not been a polite discussion between two sides an account of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan collection points.
The public meeting of the deficit of the President's on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences between the members to continue.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months a mutual respect, of the ideological divide that separates them, the members.
That is hardly enough to claim that it is a new era of cooperation here.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise, while tried the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters weigh after a new party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday and his assessment by the participants at a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep for rapid change the atmosphere in the past two years
Whether it comes to taxes, donations, health or benefits, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election Washington at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, now working for "the Ethics and Public Policy Center '.
"It is inevitable after elections.
Elections may appear partisan passions.
And that is a good thing. "
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the "lame duck session, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts, at the end of the year, and no one in the end.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, either temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans cannot afford that believing that favors tax cuts for the rich, while unemployed workers support.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House is the increased optimism that, in these issues during the "lame duck session" and also the new START treaty can ratify.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation in pressing issues of the lame duck session "does not necessarily lead to a lasting cooperation the parties must, if the new 112. Congress will convene in January.
Instead, he says, is a period of not once immensely more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, are done, this short-term psychology in turn confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also sceptical - and this scepticism is shared by many - courtesy of genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, when Vorkampf, or shadow boxing, for the main event in 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the Teeparty-voters who were instrumental in their education.
How concerned the Republican leaders also may be that they vie too high, they know that they must try to their promise to reduce government spending and healthcare reform.
This party lines are already in the first reactions on the recommendations of the deficit Commission clearly what a tax reform and raising some taxes and raising the retirement age and reduce government spending.
The Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, insisted that the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission, in order to make its plan to official recommendation and they are very close to this number.
The greatest resistance in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial issues, today at least, little room or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two stages in the fight between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first battle next year in the form of party clashes, if the Republicans in the state budget, taxes and the health system, later followed by a period of major zweiparteilicher cooperation.
What will this change?
Public opinion.
It has been proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still hopes that the two parties work together.
If confrontation is a blind alley, as happened in 1995, then both parties must carefully to ensure the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose, will change tack and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization is greater now than in the mid-1990's, and they seem a more ideological divide between Obama and the Congress to Republicans than that between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time activists on both parties 2010 as a mere prelude to a far broader election in 2012.
So it may be the courtesy to display this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that the two still separated.
Durchgesickertes US document portrayed Moscow as a port of corruption
The Control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and they are a part of the bribes and of protection money they einsammelt, to the Kremlin. As reported in February, the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both police and the state security service blackmail high protection money so that they can keep their expensive standard of living in Moscow, they say.
They collect money not only of legitimate businesses, but also by organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has described as a "vertical of authority", takes its part of the money that the ladder to the top.
The memo, which under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle, was sent to Washington on Tuesday of WikiLeaks published on its website.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written, while it was still Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and accuses him of corruption.
He was in October by President Dmitry Medvedev fired, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a construction company, have repeatedly rejected accusations of corruption for years, and he has many defamation lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, a Russian television station, when he was asked for a documentary, which suggests that he is corrupt, "it is crazy, it is bad way, it is dirty."
Like A huge number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt, The polls.
But it is unusual that, as the report of the ambassador, individuals, and it is unheard of that a diplomat from a foreign country.
"The direct link to the government of Moscow with the crime has led to some of them as" disturbing "and come to the conclusion that the government is more like a Kleptokrat acts as a government," according to the memo.
Enjoy a "Criminal elements" kryshna "(a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means" roof "or protection) on the police, the state security service (FSB), the regulator (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as by the whole Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have dreilagige structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"The FSB and MVD the militia are on the second stage."
"Least follow the ordinären criminals and the criminal inspectors at the bottom."
"This is a inkompetentes system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas, because the city offering no help."
The report says that the FSB further money from the biggest companies from the police and the small business people arrested.
A source said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection from the FSB and MVD (and not by organised crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law. '
"That is why the protection by criminal gangs as previously asked."
The memo noted that, while the collection of the funds is complete, protecting themselves very modest pay no; even the, the, are sometimes arrested.
That does not pay, find their business very quickly closed - because of one or other Vorwands.
Medvedev has spoken several times to combat corruption, but noted that he has made little progress.
The memo the message contains descriptions of men, which probably with suitcases full of money were in the Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption must Medvedev rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of When, a Moscow think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he is part of this tape."
"It is not part of the political class, because of a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, When, corruption Russia more than $300 billion per year.
The country is ranked 154 a recent study on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparence International (by "the least corrupt countries" to "most corrupt ").
The disclosure of the memos the American embassy, what happened after Moscow time late will certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be blamed for the mistakes of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that the problems will resolve.
In an interview with Larry King of CNN said Putin that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted furiously to the revelation that American diplomats have called it Medvedev Batman and Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we did not expect that to happen with such arrogance, such pressure and unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans to confrontation with the past forced
In a poorly lit, betonierten class room with dirty and abblätternden walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School to the man who built him in the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he has taken his people," said Sreng kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "butchers", the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in the north west of Cambodia's popular, where he hospitals and bridges built infrastructure has developed and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the surrender of the Khmer Rouge to the Government, are longstanding supporters in Anlong Veng challenged.
In April allowed a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum the victims the public confrontation with the people who once the regime.
In June, the government distributed an object that children for the first time a former soldier told the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community of the UN and Cambodia tribunal sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge, as the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, sentenced to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments grew fear among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs hindered their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into society of Cambodia.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation, the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge is impressive, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It is splitting families."
In Cambodia During the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot's Ied government, fled the remnants of the regime and its military on the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
This widespread them until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary guerrilla war from its base in the western mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok, the next generation Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters, the government began cross which led to the Kapitulationen Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of natural causes, and Ta Mok, who had not given in 1999 by government forces in the Dangrek Mountain arrested.
He died in 2006 in the Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting his trial.
As their benefactors they are no longer protected, fled most former Khmer Rouge fighters in the exhausting poverty of the rural Cambodia and many axed the movement in nostalgic memories.
Even if a few elite officials Khmer Rouge their local government posts axed because they laid down their arms, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have very little benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang by the Centre for justice and reconciliation in Cambodia, in Anlong Veng, public forums
"They are enshrined in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They rose without any professional know."
Sor Lim, 55 years in 1974 as a teenager of Rhmer Rouge had joined, fought in the jungle to Anlang Veng 1998 defeat before he left to lead a life as poor rice farmers.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"TA Mok has given each something to eat."
"But now life is difficult, because we must look to ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also raises concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try president Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge ministers, to court.
The mission of the Court it is the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities to condemn, but it has not said whether it will pursue further action on these four cases.
That has done little to the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation focused on In Chaem, 64 years during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970's district leader in the province Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007 it had a representative of Documentation Centre of Cambodia told they have the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project, in which thousands of forced labour probably died.
On a hot night came In Chaem of the work in the fields on her wooden house on a dirty streets outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadow on the desiccated grass in Chaem it refused to discuss of its past in the Khmer Rouge.
The court should they vorladen would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia is living in peace and stability," she said.
"There would be no prosecutions more would be in war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, the 1878 of the Khmer Rouge has fled, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would more suspects on trial, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk of documentation centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer-times means bring the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to this broken parts together, so that everything can understand."
The centre has created the first approved by the government object on the Khmer Rouge, the 75seitige "history of Democratic Kampuchea."
It circulated the book in June in Anlong Veng appended to the history books for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides on the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia know young people in Anlong Veng little about the Khmer Rouge regime, despite the links of the city.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new object helps students to understand, an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejected many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious, because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such a resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the object and the court and gain influence, "he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge here has a powerful attraction.
Top In the Dangrek mountains leads a Sträuchern überwucherter and plastic waste verdreckter path to a rectangle over of black soot, covered with a pair Blechdach.
Pol Pot's body was here after his death in 1998 on a pile of burning tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years, a Handyverkäuferin roadside, said she does not know much about the man, who had been burned.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later in the day, it wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where they will give a bush mature bananas - in the hope that it will bring their luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect weapons-grade uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials, the government of Belarus on Wednesday announced that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
The deal was in a joint statement after a meeting of the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov Security Summit announced an additional article.
The US government has for years tried to convince Belarus, not collect more highly enriched uranium and seemed to have achieved a hurdle last spring.
But officials of the US government told the Washington Post that in the last two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been taken to remove Belarus 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research center.
The agreement on Wednesday, setting the stage for the rest of the material to be removed, according to an official staff because of the sensitivity of the subject, anonymous, approximately 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "nuclear security summit in April, the White ruled Russia.
And it was obvious good enough, at the invitation of the former Soviet republic to secure the next summit in 2012.
"I was really thrilled about the fact that they want a nuclear security summit (2012) seat."
"It shows me that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the partnership Global security, a group promoting nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant step" of Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague, within four years to secure all vulnerable nuclear material.
Since then, the US government six countries helped her to get rid of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has declared that the nation will never abandon their uranium.
"How retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what fundamentally weapons is capable of, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said then.
"This is our commodity...
"We use it only for research purposes, this dirty bombs and we will not sell."
Belarus still approached a few months ago the US meeting on an agreement anzeigte than interest.
The first attempt to remove the uranium Belarus in October, was particularly complicated, because the material easily contaminated by radiation, say officials.
It was in a Spezialzug load, the more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The US government pays $14 million for this effort, with a large part of the money in the Belarusian research with depleted uranium, which can be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely careful coordinated in order to build confidence," which led to the agreement which was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy, the global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nichtweiterzugebende study estimates that Belarus this year at least 88 pounds waffenfähhigen uranium, and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be under the joint agreement camps until 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But the statement Wednesday suggests a possible rapprochement.
"The progress of this global security issues heißend welcome the United States of America and Belarus aware that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens", they said.
No objections to the Spanish Government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners on Spanish territory to Guantanamo, as seen from a telegram the Ambassador of U.S.A. in Madrid.
The reflect the enhüllten Wikileaks and the daily newspaper El País "(cable) support documents. It added that the former deputy leader María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, the Spanish Government should be informed," proving that foreign aircraft flying over Spain, properly monitored. "
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid to human rights practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, discussed the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy leader was "met on the sidelines Zapatero", the report by the Council and confirmed, Spain have nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain have no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They simply want to be informed," not "unprepared to be surprised," said Aguirre cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the ambassador pointed out that the Spanish Government "no great attention to this matter, although the government have little influence, as they have in the hands of the judges."
The prosecutor Vicente González was in January 2007, the message to understand that the initiative of the judicial Deklassifizierung documents the Spanish intelligence services central (CNI) and the defense minister on CIA flights to request would not block.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
However, the United States was on the 'apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors' more concerned than about the deklassifizierte information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent Untersuchern will complicate our efforts to discreet handling between governments," bemoaned Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, which was attended by the ambassador of the United States and the Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly hard on their independence and do what they feel is appropriate," he gave instructions to his staff, "bloated rhetorical comments to avoid the tension abate."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the way the PP in this matter.
"Despite the generally pro-American stance our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt, an indication that the US government Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital, even if these revelations will have a negative impact on the government of the United States", he stresses.
The Kindsmörderin recognises that it had on the Internet about the "of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child, when this was already dead and had a blog: "Terror on Galician nature."
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki."
Under this epithet from small, it considers a Kusine and at least one friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The messages are from the year 2008.
To understand this, you must know her love life, the daily newspaper ABC, on the basis of testimony, their families.
The 30-year-old Galician Mrs 1998 adopted a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
It was a year ago.
Their relationship had dissolved Shortly after it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby from him, but his former gave him a DNA analysis.
Already It was briefly a different relationship.
The select few was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
With him they lived together for a long time.
César lived in them.
As the young woman in the Balearic Islands, on the labour market, the small shop remained their partners, they even accompanied a week to Palma.
But from the content of their intelligence, their love cracked and they parted.
In March 2008 she is alone in Minorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and sour because I came here to work."
"When I told him, he found it well, but now says he, of course, what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free to do what it wants."
Later, it said in a statement that it has received the phone: 'I want you this month zurückkommst or an address to which I can send you the boys. "
She complains: "When my mother, I will put it to him that I do not like the boys him back, where I am."
In May it speaks of the return to their village: "this week I will go there, but I will only stay there until 19 on 20 of work, because I imagine must, if I do not want to lose."
They said that they take their first-born, if all goes well.
"He never will be, it must be, that is, in the me. I will let someone else except when my mother him back again in life," a dubious intention, if we take into account their poor relationship.
In July, there is another mail.
When she writes it, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on 1 month and allegedly murdered on 10, is dead.
"On the one hand, on the other hand, is César satisfied."
"He is with me, and the place like him a little bit, but on the other hand it must go to school every day."
She speaks of a move to Mallorca.
"He will (the boy) to attend a summer course, I have less expenditure for the nanny."
On 17: Memories and complaints.
"A Riesenkuss of César, the asks me, when you. '
"Alberto says he has sent e-mail me any videos. See you, if he wants, he finds me, so a dung."
On 30 one more thing: "The boys have done well. He is a summer course in Catalan."
By Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "he shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime- and Mangablogs, there are communications from her.
They even had their own blog on MySpace, which is now closed, and in which she called "Muki Gefängnisentlasserin."
"Terrorism a la gallega (title)".
The last man who lived with her, a vereidigter hunting supervisor, said remorse because he felt guilty.
He cannot be that everything happened because she had not told him that she was single mother.
Mónica was yesterday by the Centre for court prisoners on Minorca to provincial prison of Palma.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, said it could not recall the expiry of the facts, "and they have not had the intention the small damage."
However, before It had stood, César have drowned in the bathtub and his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric assessment.
Partido Popular won four seats in Congress, and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November could the PP in the cities Lérida Tarragona and Barcelona play a decisive role
After the Members can intercept significant voice and growth in the last regional elections focus the PP is already on the parliamentary elections - or not preferred. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes, the party achieved in these elections, is normally twice as high as in elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan People's Party 610.473 votes in the parliamentary elections of 2008, during this paragraph in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
Last Sunday reached the PPC 384.091 votes.
If these rising trend - the diversion of the voting shares of the PSC and the fixing of the electorate the PP - should encourage the PP, analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections the PPC from 8 to 12 congressmen could rise, while also CiU four (it now has 10) gains and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (by 25).
These calculations show the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party would lose a Member of the ERC, currently has three - while ICV keep their Members or gains.
However, the electoral calendar should be maintained, the next date with the local elections in May 2011. Also, the tongue on the People "s Party (PP) can be an end to domination of the socialist, and in four provincial capitals and do with their majority in the city council, one of the city authorities with the largest budget: 661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC cities Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona in which socialists neither a majority still on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV back.
After the Republican debacle, it is not unreasonable that the party will lose their representation in the local council emblematic in which they should reach 5% of the votes.
The PP, recorded an increase in their vote share in the four provincial capitals and could lead to the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced they can play the main role in Tarragonas turnaround. Had there before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP government.
The PP Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the recent election campaign leaders met several times.
In other important areas, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party a significant growth.
Currently, the PP in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and wants the formation of lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell concerned Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three further in Thailand
The seven of the policemen of the Geheimdienststelle of the police was taken Pakistanis arrested and the Nigerians formed the Thailand controlled dschihadistische cell, how Al Qaida-Gruppen, including the 'Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba (let), the latter was the author of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, the 2008 106 deaths - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister is a great importance to this research, which so far is that he assured, with "operation Kampai" falsification of Al Qaeda worldwide "weakened" and "so their ability to act."
The researchers expect that in the two years in which the cell has been active in Catalonia, thousands of passports to Thailand, where these were falsified and then sent to the groups, from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, were sent up that exceed the limits of European and other Western countries.
The any cell is not the only one of the jihadist network, which has been active in Europe. therefore, apart from the Thai investigative bodies, other European police forces involved in the investigation. It is not inconceivable that in the area of the EU in the next few days to similar attacks such as the last Tuesday, which will be conducted in Barcelona.

In study circles stresses that until now no links between the Catalonia arrested and the attack in Mumbai, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was one of the recipients of stolen in Spain and then in Thailand counterfeit passports.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the attack in Catalonia from via a money transfer company were sent several thousand dollars in buying prepaid cards for mobile phones "invested" later by the members of the "commandos," the lives of 106 people brought an end, have been used.

The chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday offered the opportunity to Artur Mas personally their conditions to support his term as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. This is no different from the already during the election campaign and raised with the primacy of economic recovery and the regionalist independence adventures as a financial compensation agreement the regional leaders at the height of his mandate to propose.

The old nursing home confirmed that the deaths are not due to "lack of action"
The owners of the old homes in Olot does not preclude their carers on eleven elderly killed
The leaders of the old nursing homes La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, highlighted the damage the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurses, who during his work had killed at least eleven old people, for which he was responsible, the establishment had caused.
The head of the care home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada in court and announced, "La Caritat would indict the responsible (for deaths)," but "the right and our liability compel us to adopt the process and the civil liability".
The establishment is not just a social prestige because they accept the criminal acts of Pflegers not realised in time, but now a high compensation paid by the legal representatives of the families of the victims will be calculated.
Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime originates in August 2009 and that he had since the killing.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing homes - because he suspected that no doctor has examined the deceased person, but the formalities because of their age and disease by telephone.
The head of La Caritat prominent writers have expressed this point flatly and declared that "any time the reason for the lack of measures may have been incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there was "no evidence in the dispute for negligent acts a person other than the accused."
The already as "death angel" getaufte acknowledged yesterday and said that the first eleven murders committed crimes on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later, the second old lady.
In this case he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that he had a mix of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff access to medicines is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail of nurses in six of nine crimes committed in patients with the death of their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will be able to see whether Vila is lying and for his first victims actually a less cruel death or whether he chose this ausbrannte from within, by offering them Bleichlauge verabreichte as he loudly confession in three women had done, he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat listens to the Pflegers no faith, even as the number of murders, which could be much more. This attitude is justified that Vila very different statements in court had made and that it makes no sense to change its approach after eight successful murders suddenly
They say that they did it is for this reason and to clarify the scope of these events to the judiciary.
Posturing of the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted strongly yesterday on the threat of ECB President Trichet, warned that "markets should not underestimate our capacity to respond."
The euro Peripheriländer risk premia increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
We should, however, the possibility that the ECB and the euro can hardly deceive points, which led to concern not underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical for an illiquid market collapses in the extent to which he recovered, but following the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not lose his fear.
A month ago urged the European Central Bank to reverse our Liquiditätmsaßnahmen, whereby the ECB tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many times in the future, must backtrack.
The Bundesbank has called for the lifting of the plan to buy government debt, because they are ineffective, and the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. it is Only a einwöchiger permanent access will be maintained.
After the Ireland-crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures "at least until March" extended and the quarterly contracts with unlimited access at quarter end to guarantee the liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the programme to buy bonds and spend a stärkendes signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response from the markets yesterday back and if halstarrig insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures can only God help us!
Just as with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank confirmed the purchase of government debt securities not to consider and then the markets collapsed, that history could repeat tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and tenaciously.
In May showed the teeth and on Wednesday said they, too, which they bought a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday was the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal rather weak.
The state asset management was only 500 million to 5,28% to 750 million 4,81% in the previous auction.
Yet the interest rates in Portugal by 30 basis points across the curve and reflected a perception changes in the markets after the words Trichet's.
In Ireland the Schuldenlochs of Allied and Bank of Ireland the figures were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible further 15 000. There is time until February, private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost all its credibility, after it had not identified the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures within the framework of the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain the parliamentary assent to his new budget next Tuesday. Because it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has their discourse at the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate. There is political unity needed to show that together we play the same score.
The problem is that Germany Wagner wants to play and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethoven's.
The Spanish Government yesterday emphasised the action plan on Friday is expected to be approved by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reducing the public deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures, The sound like Vivaldis four seasons in the ears of investors.
The dual effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared with the February was the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain quickly and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bonds, which will benefit from the Trichet Effect. That is why we are a strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to refinance.
The application of an aid plan for Spain would be a self-sacrifice.
We would liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would close without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with the motto Caesar's wife: "Now is not only the existence, but also of bogus."
Only courage that we create.
The CEO of preaching fechtet at the request of his children the meeting of shareholders of Vega Sicilia in
The storm in open conflict the family Álvarez, owner of the societies preaching and El Enebro, flaut.
David Alvarez, the founder of the Unternehmensgurppe, the meeting of shareholders of El Enebro contest will be held on 16, at the request of five of his seven children, because it is "absolutely void". His children will try to obtain a majority, the administrative bodies of the firm - winner of the wine while Bodegas Vega Sicilia - to control.

The founder of the largest Holdings for business services does not appear to be prepared, in his legal battle for control of the institutions of El Enebro.
It has been driven by five of his seven children from the Board. This appointed to the shareholder meeting on 18 January this year, the trade is already being challenged register to board members.
The meeting of shareholders of El Enebro by the judges of the Court No 2 Madrid convened for 16, has a new thunderclap Álvarez triggered in the lap of the family.
The recourse to the judge for organising the assembly is the only legal way of convening the meeting of shareholders.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz by David Alvarez as a "desperate funding of applicants - his five children - interpreted by means of legal wrangling, scams and rights abuses on the annulled Assembly of 18 January recognised," as official spokesperson.
This argument is the basis for the appeal against the Assembly to explain to them as "absolutely void".
The same protagonists in discrete silent, already unsuccessfully tried in June to richterlichem path to convene a meeting.
In El Enebro - assets society and holders of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, alongside other assets - control David Álvarez 'seven children 100 percent of the capital.
However, the founder of the group, according to family Services protocols use about 51% of the capital.
That is the background for which the judge in the hearing on treatment of the challenge, for which no date has yet been set, has to decide.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The car will be improved with a software in real time.
Since 2004 Red Bull in the world of Formula 1 is their history in this splendid universe of speed of surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid the newcomer attention and, despite its sharply rising will round during the recent seasons began the final sprint victory last November, all of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso.
Without the capabilities of the German pilots and champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault to belittle want is the "secret weapon" that the multi-Siemens Red Bull in the hands, and created a winning team, have become legend.
In reality is a powerful software to simulate processes, the German company in 2007 for purposes of motor racing to the market.
This was dubbed PLM computer programme for the development of assembling chains in factories around the world, energy plants and precise instruments used.
The goal is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is built, so as to avoid mistakes and unnecessary costs.
PLM has made the development of the cameras from Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the industrial department of Siemens, said that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements to the race and the tests, design and implement.
Russwurm contends that in 1992 from the maximum average 10 technicians worked in a season three or four could introduce improvements.
In Red Bulls team are now 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer equipment they analyses and all sorts of changes to the cars.
The Siemens managers said that the PLM software is all the components of the cars Rennwagen of Red Bull to analyse and improve, with the exception of the Motors, the only responsible for Renault.
The materials, the fuel, the Aerodynamik and the elements will be changed.
The changes, thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech Autoklaven in less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the Simulators into reality.
The only limit this madness technical perfect is set to spend $40 million, a formula 1 team for his race in a season.
Red Bull has its high-tech factory for the development and production of its cars in a remote place built 50 kilometres from London.
There are two buildings in which visits, particularly from journalists are severely limited.
Everything that is happening is, Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls real formula 1 - hero is the latest zweifelslos world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the huge technological resources, which the Energy-Drink producer in the services of its participation in the race tracks is hiding other protagonists whose support priceless and whose fame is zero.
The Technologichef the plant, Steve Nevey emphasised that, five years ago, we could say that the progress made in R & D for cars with 50% to victory and earned the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology is 85% of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 per cent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computer, because they "are not voraussagbare gladiators'.
Us 20 In two years will own shops with local distributors open
Hewlett-Packard (Barcelona) weihte yesterday in his first exclusive shop in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a twenty shops existing sales network with 80 to 100 square metres, the multi-intends to open in the next two years in Spain.
The company agreed this initiative with the existing 16 sales in more brands, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The Deputy chairman of us España, Helena Herrero, called the reconstructed as an example of the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, cooperating with the took for thirty years.
The US group intends to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first was last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera was the next Neueröffnungen not betrayed, but not that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairman, also head of us personnel system is assured, the philosophy to shop opening was always the same. They have a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The US group is working this and accepts the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products tangible). Same all shops in Europe.
It is also responsible for the training of the shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and stressed that with the exclusive sales network intends that "the customer service and the advice of micro- and small purchases, and then, even to optimise the packaging."
The shop in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot programme that the technical problems the us-devices with guarantee solves.
An online service builds a link to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and micro-enterprises and private customers, because the big companies already have their service contracts for technical service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years, a million customers' steal '
The caretaker board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war.
However, he sees a collapse in interest rate spreads, the banks are trying to offset with increases of fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expected in three years million private customers - a consensus still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to the next three years, and so in a very difficult economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new Dreijahresleitplan 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without public aid from the FROB to take market share, but also a million private customers - 700 000 if the customers, the bank will lose - to increase. This is the great challenge facing this Bank, because until now it has their business customers more attention than their retail customers.
This year it has 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Its market share in retail is 3.5 per cent, while the business customers more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of 2011-2013 business plan is increasing the productivity, austerity, reducing costs. The challenges facing the bank so that together with annual report.
Only a few banks are daring in these difficult times targets and to publish, since the banks all plans are disrupted by the financial crisis worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its master plan Optima set four years ago this year. This was initially interpreted to three years, but due to the market situation he was extended for a year.
The Customers who leave the savings banks, are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organised by the APIE stressed Guardiola, 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a longer range."
The manager expects Spain would only "slow" out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years' work crucial to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - the interest margins punished - will abate, will the risk premia, banks and building societies must pay for their emissions to maintaining liquidity as compensation for sagging profit margins already shifted onto the price of loans.
"The issues liquidity and funding are of a structural nature, and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We have not tap off the tap, but the Zinsdifferenziale are very high," Guardiola said.
BANESTO Thursday were already ordering their Filialnetz from restricting the granting of long-term loans, and to increase the Zinsdifferenziale (cf. Cinco Díaz on 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks have now Stategie, "to increase the fees, within a competitive framework".
Sabadells master plan is based on an organic growth, even if the group does not exclude, as always, corporate transactions.
Not for nothing he assured that in Spain 'larger companies are necessary. "
"In the coming year will change everything," he assures.
He stressed that the need for capital currently "huge increase" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions in red figures are falling.
He is of the opinion that the FROB in Kaptitalaufstockungen replace the money market.
Having said that Sabadell a temporary closure of the markets could survive, he refuted the argument of some bankers already predict a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that nothing can be in circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, you could get short-term funding on Repogeschäfte and intercept the crisis.
CECA includes a second wave of merger savings from
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that it could come to a wave of mergers of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
As the concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there were several savings banks in the first phase. They retained the second round.
On the other hand, assured the Director-General of the Spanish savings banks Federation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, this second round would not take place.
"I believe that the majority of the merger is completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The biggest part is over. It may be that we instead of siebzehen 13 or 14, but all important processes are already complete. They were of Banco de España, all transactions has strongly supported."
In a group of business leaders and managers Aragoniens (ADEA) led Olavarrieta, that the concentration process was completed "as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the prompt expiry in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España has been set," he said.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million of assets at 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unvergleichbarer process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now very much greater, so we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "there are a number of unabgebrachter opinions about the slow pace of the process, Unseriösität and absurdity" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorted us, within the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain is one of the strictest funding systems in Europe and throughout the world have "perhaps" and added that those who anzweifeltenn this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager said, that we do not have to worry "about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks in the current economic recovery," the concentration process a "very significant" experienced "will happen as soon as possible".
He also remembered that the Spanish banks stress tests, the ECB in July, have been very good.
Zapatero and the red line Germany
Berlin has opted for keeping the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reliefs for small and micro-enterprises, regulating temporary work agencies or the lifting of the 426 euro support for the unemployed, no unemployment benefit related to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, supports the deputy leader, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis presents.
How are these transactions to understand?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of their public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
It is Germany a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future to maintain ancient traditions clash of much of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe begins one in Germany to spekuliern on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south to leave the euro area.
The Second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although it is more science fiction sounds - supported by a large part of public opinion, approximately 50% of the population.
The Third: A transformation of the euro under German proposals. This means: More macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalise the countries, broken; möglichereweise the default of certain countries, and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures on the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been for some time. So there are no excuses now.
First 2009, as both the IMF and the European Commission for deficits, and the German Government constitutional reform, in order to prevent it from 2016.
It was the first signs of the polarisation between what Germany was thought necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign the Central European country than Merkel postponed the decision to save Greece painful,.
Then it was strongly criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel in the last October days again with a clear position, It calls for a reform of the European Union agreements, to enable the rescue of one country while private lenders to commit a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, since they propelled Ireland crisis and everything.
But her proposal, if a little sweetened, was approved in the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it intends not to exceed.
It says all that - even if unpopular measures must be taken, from that date there will no longer be the old ways of the euro.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which the countries to ban be severely punished, be forced to declare themselves bankrupt and in this case, the private sector must play a part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need a strong growth path, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
The alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as was mentioned by Spain in boom times, will simply not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would badly do not understand it.
It is not just about the deficit to 3% by the year 2013 runterzufahren.
The demands are much harder.
Under these conditions, And the worst thing we could do is to cheat.
I hope that the current turbulence in more calm.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us by early 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has taken this so well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel hypothesis, in order to make their way.
But Germany-red line is there, and it is not that something would change.
Among the possibilities is that In countries with little serious full gestopften euro area, not to be excluded.
In this case, we still say it could have warned us.
Sport and usually bypass
Tricks as Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the desire to bypass a sanction.
The supposedly from two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) has instigated exclusion in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to much ink has been shed about, whether it was a unsportliche act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, lost two players a few minutes before game end (their team had already clearly won) time and played several fouls, now the second yellow card by referee showed.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid his group, the two players would meet the prescribed sanction the next league game against Auxerre and without maps in the next game phase.
Finally, the Disziplinarkommitee of UEFA, the coach of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different sums of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in this or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed in the sport's rules.
Part of the debate that have arisen outlined the case goes back to that a team of football clubs, Real Madrid (his anthem Edelmut claims and honour and on other occasions his players for similar incidents had punished) played the key role, and the drama by Mourinho, the episode has added to its long history, more than theatralischer and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate about whether this is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes behaviour contradicts the principles of the sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. indeed, this approach to the statutes of the sport, but its meaning.
The damage caused to the sporting spirit should be examined in this matter.
The sporting spirit defended the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because there was no aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that to ban players an unjustified. Also benefits from the team that has not been done.
The paradox of the action of Real Madrid's players is that they do not correspond to what we normally under wrong game or rule bypass understand, because the circumvention of the rule has not been secretly, in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible, so that they will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and took the sanction happily.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender from the deliberate fouls.
It should be emphasised that the rival either in a disadvantageous position was still benefits for the feigned game were erheischt because the obvious result of this action was that the team with fewer players had to play.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players.
Obviously The advantage is that the players the next phase of the Champions League game without tickets, their participation in a future game could begin.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain point uncertain advantage because the team could eventually retire. With this approach, players also receive a sanction and go in the second cycle on cards, because card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle of departures.
So it is not clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the sporting spirit, also include strategic decisions from the rules a maximum benefit.
In this case the players wanted to avoid any penalty (that would actually be a clear case of rule bypass), they wanted more when they undergo this.
They took a strategic decision, without a sentence or to flee before her.
Although the border between imagination and Regelumgebung is, I believe, that this is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen as a result of two factors: Because two exclusions and because of the way the provoking Regelübertragung.
The damage done to the principles of the sport by these acts is less ethical than aesthetic.
Supply offensive to catch customers for groups-Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar, this year an avalanche of bookings fall on the day 16 and 17 December.
The employees themselves paid celebrations are spreading. They do not want to spend more than EUR 20 to 30.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are groups in the run-up to Christmas dinner at the hotel and Freizeitgewerbe was taken oxygen. but as a result of the economic crisis solve a price offensive to the customer segment, which is the great mass, capture: Almost all want to between 20 and 30 euros for a Mittag- or dinner, confirm the these businessmen and associations.

Since 2008, when the bad times, many companies have started the groups dinner for budgetary reasons.
These do not have to surrender tradition, many workers pay this from their own pockets.
How is the economy, the lowest prices, confirms the chairman of the restaurants body of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organisation is not to predict how the holidays this month.

"They would like, but they respect heavily on prices," he stressed.
The business will go well, "the quality at good prices, with a good service," he adds, and calls to remind us that the customers in times of crisis, why prices of around EUR 25 most demand.
In a survey in various central restaurants turns out that the evening of 17 2008 providers leads to the collapse.
The group Soteras says the demand for this Friday, with the intention of less than 30 would spend EUR boom. The group has its Menüs with complete offered between 25 and 35 euro adapted to the economic situation.
In the other group leaders, Andilana maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the oddity of the calendar early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible last year's prices with Menüs for every taste of 19,95 to 30 euro," he says.
In Alleanza Nazionale Grup, El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 local guides, you lose the optimism not once since the second quarter of the revenues are good, even if few days focused prospects for the Christmas season.
Sources also point out that the 18 a corporate group on active day with friends, the Christmas will be.
The six Gruppenmenüs was a Christmas menu for EUR 30 or more than Preishit added. The impression is that clients are prepared to spend 10 percent more than last year in exchange for more details, such as cava.
In some companies see green shoots grow again why the employees will be invited. This gives the impression that the groups eat is back on the upswing.
On The Part of the umbrella Fecasarm (with mergers as the pub, equally and leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomà to the end of the tunnel and noted that the reservations are "lively", although the customers' a maximum ".
The fun on celebrations but not declined, regardless of who pays.

The Internet portal Wikileaks revealed content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the US state department confirmed the enormous concern the Pakistani nuclear program, Washington.
On the fringes of the informative and hefty details, the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited American diplomats in Islamabad, reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear safety is not but in reverse "is falling," and that the unstable Asian country more nuclear weapons, "to a faster Rhytmus than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are made up, but its individual parts are stored in a possible attack their destruction - Washington sleepless nights.
These risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit by the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, said: "The proximity of some nuclear plants by the Taliban ravaged area, the probable were scattered of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes are implied, will not only by the United States, but also Russia more than ausufernd and considered reason caution.
"Pakistan must strictly gläubiges personnel to guard nuclear plants employ; because of the low educational and cultural levels have extremist organisations more opportunities to reklutieren personnel involved in nuclear or missile programs," said the expert Yuri Korolev by the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with his American counterpart.
New to the Julian Assanges website revealed documentation is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation and the increased pace in the Pakistan nuclear weapons.
In May, the message from an office describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, said: "There is no transparency; often offers of aid we receive no replies or rejected."
Another confirms Peter Lavoy, officials of the state secret service for South Asia that "despite the economic Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country produces. '
The Ambassador Patterson asked Washington during a visit of top army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, the "clear" that "Pakistan's army its tacit support to terrorist groups."
In the race for Wikileaks head
Obama appoints a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new revelations.
Interpol is a red warning to monitor and detect Assange.
Everything with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated maze in which facts just difficult to explain.
Yesterday Interpol "red alert" to "locate and prosecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional layout on the arrest.
Furthermore, it is not new, it comes from the 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the recent revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse, which the Australians in Sweden.
Also assured the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police know where and how they could contact with Mr Assange."
Already on 20 was the international police agency based in Lyon (France) at the request of Sweden ordering from, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving authorisation by the Swedish authorities.
That is the way things. The 188 Interpol-dependent countries are to identify and locate "Assange provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol the arrest of a red warning affected individual cannot issue orders, many member countries according to the Organisation see the red warning as a Arrestierung - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreements, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely.
The action Assanges outraged lawyers gesten published a letter in which they were informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange has the exit from Sweden and requested by the prosecutor, with the sagenumwobenen Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, compared to the approval.
"It is a fighter, not as a legal persecution," the letter.
While the world is seeking him - and his mother of Australia from the innocence of their son - Assange at an unknown location, but not in silence.
On Monday he was the head of the magazine Time via Skype from an unspecified location. In an interview the conversation he requested the resignation of US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and international agreement signed by the United States, they should resign," he said.
His opinion was yesterday by the White House, press secretary Robert Gibbs, condemned the request to resign as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I am not sure why we value on the opinion of a type with a website," he told CNN.
Obama himself has a high responsible for the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, charged with the prevention of new documents revelations.
The attempt by the spokesperson of the Präsidenden Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention to, contrary to the views of the conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, from January lead the National Security COM Mitee the House of Representatives, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "in order to seize their money and those who supported or to make a contribution to follow."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, has gone further, and he had to withdraw his statement, Assange "murdered".
"Obama should turn it into a target and a not bemanntes aircraft or what use."
Anyone not apologising, was Mike Huckabee, baptistischer ministers, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever It was always the leaked information in the government, he is guilty of treason and everything that is no execution is eiine to mild punishment", he told the broadcaster Fox.
Puigcercós addiction with a nod to the Carod close to peace in the ERC
The Republican leaders allowed the party a secret vote on his continuation in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a formula for the umpteenth time an internal rebellion in the ranks of the following the loss of 11 Members and half of the electorate rudderless ERC from the path.
The party leader is aware that his threat of resignation the close to the former party leader, Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the impact of this sector today is so weakened as her mentor itself and he will not bring the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore tried Esquerra's leaders with a nod to the new critics to win, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning kündete yesterday that about 200 regional Council members of ERC on his secret could stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with superior hand.
If the Carodisten the Präsidenen wanted to miss a parking ticket, they could do this without fear of reprisals.
Indeed, the head of both the impression of division and subjection to avoid his person.
In several interviews he, he would deal with the half the votes plus a not feel confirmed, and he added without giving any indication of percentage values, "as a result, Bulgarian style" would also not good.
The Carod close to demand the president is more than just the party office. An inadequate gesture, since Puigcercós the supreme body of controlled congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to speeding up of resignations, will be the chairman of an action plan from now until May.
They expect that in the drafting of the document on strategic reorientation that the leadership on 18 will put to the vote in the Council to participate.
Their intention is to underwrite Puigcercós. In return, this promise, the Congress in the autumn of 2011, what the party is already a fact.
The chairman of the ERC believes that "Polyphonie" shame the stability and wants once and for all, the organisation in the situation to bring to wash their dirty linen behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article, which the President-in-Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog signed symptomatic.
Given the Puigcercós is an ideologue, kept the holders of Innovació it for a fact that the party chairman "in exchange for various objectives" will be based.
He was one of five to two.
Firstly, the "restructuring" of the board, so that at least 90 percent of the party members, that means the inclusion of new faces from Carods environment.
The second could be great news.
Huguet proposes ERC should the General Assembly principle than functioning finally abandon.
He verfechtet a reform of the Statute, which should make it possible to hold the meetings with elected delegates.
By the end of the General Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team that already in the last two conferences fought obsessively.
Indeed, on the bebenden assembly of 2008 the party leadership with the review of the General Assembly principle on a Congress that should deal with the reform of the statutes.
This deadline is still out, because infogle internal Aufruhe of recent years, addressing this issue was not advisable.
Now, without the critical sectors are on the lookout, could be the time has come to this issue and for ever.

The finger on the wound With literature
The second round of 'the enthusiasm for language' was a walk, in which the participants to narrative
"I do understand, but With the sex into the language... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" Asked the author Luisa Valenzuela, the second round of Los placeres de la lengua 'should open a cycle, the spanischsprachige literature used her question (and on this occasion celebrated the subtitles on another event was devoted to tell round table the sex in the language, she said).
The finger... in the wound "brings us in difficulties," spuckte Argentine Schriftstellein sweet the audience that made mainly from young people at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) met this by Marisol Shultz moderierten round table attending to the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero attended.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text the Gonzalo Celorio dedicated and Shultz later as a great narrative marked. Luisa told in the first person and is a champion of the search is to know what a "wound" and from doctor to doctor, from which it receives no answer, but the guide to its narrative.
The Infektologen leaves they convinced: "Patience is not my strength, perhaps it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating rapprochement with the trauma theorists, is in the middle of the the respiratory raubte, and declared that wound is not a scientific term, enthült psychoactive analysts the mystery: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs easier and that they "learned of the wound only that this really was open and does not exist". But it is convinced that the mood in the language and their traps mingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguans Sergio Ramírez asked a entzückende story, which he called 'praise of invention, and the finger on the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous Zauberin the clouds covered, far gereiste men brought back or by a girl lost virtue restored. The narrative made a U-turn and reported of America, the great novel, not to his own Chronisten lacked from the outset, and he cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo, of the abundance of criticised by Eroberen told stories.
"Cervantes, all of us (the writer), spottete invited the false witnesses in the stories appeared, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told - with imagination, even the shame."
However, he emphasises that 'it is the madmen and liar, the best things imagine approaching reality and lie to each other "and where we no longer know what side the narrative, where the fictitious literature reached the summit.
He calls the Cervantes' real 'tradition.
"We have inherited from him what told."
As Mayra Montero in the series was annotated and praised the writer the diversity of interpretations, to which the invitation of the FIl on the round table had contributed "the finger in the wound".
The Kubanerin and Puertorikanerin devoted their contribution of major wound of social violence which affects their country - as all of Latin America - as a result of fighting the drugs trade.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs, a tacit, not deliberate commitment," she said, after they had highlighted that literature is binding and communication between the author and the reader as a "chemical reaction".
The evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution has also "this finger writer in the wound of the author," hevorhob.
He noted that in a fast-moving world the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness dogmatism, and forget that "behind every confirmation a small no and every denial is a small yes."
"In our thoughts and reality, we have to moderate, and moderate often puts its finger on the wound and harassing those who are much more comfortable in the form of cartoons in black and white, prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also the powerful harassing that prefer to divide the world in black and white said he and invited to rediscover the spirit of the letter.
Romano is fighting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back, and (he has experienced in his career, but three times he played crucial games.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final are also two different styles, and their antagonisms of her set by their respective coaches meeting is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three defeats in Endspielen back, and (he has experienced in his career, but he has had three crucial games, and so far he has done well why this opportunity is of particular importance for him.
The Argentine has with the medal for the second consecutive Endspiele champion overworked, he is a step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has with the same team.
The santistische strategist, the first final as coach in the 'Torneo Apertura 2002' than del Morelia the reins, with whom he had against Toluca learnt a great defeat with a 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the crucial duel, which he also with 3-1 against Rayados lost.
Already With Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, had a setback some Rubén again, since the game 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 game minutes undecided, but the penalty he came forward and received two opportunities with 3-1, got the title, but ultimately failed three of his players the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén already had two Endspiele with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, why would he not again be pursued by the disaster and free themselves of the evil sorcerer, for the first time to celebrate a title, although he confirmed that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I would like to be champion, I would like to break any statistics, that is for a club, for my affection that I hingebe, and so the title to me, but what happened before, is the most important thing", the tax man, when asked about the lost Endspiele.
The last final is still largely stayed with him, he assured, to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson, we can draw from this is that to not act, we can celebrate the referee not the end, we are prepared for the players, because the last time we were on the line with two Elfmetern already prepared to depart, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration."
To know that this series will be decided by shoot could not worried him, because he trusts his players: "You never want the shoot, it would be in the regular playing time, but sometimes there is no alternative, and we must be prepared in the previous tour, we were prepared, but unfortunately, we were the fate of a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us with something for this and we hope that this time it will not happen."
It is in Romanso power, not only second to be champion and costing the glory, the title for the first time.

After the overthrow of a foreign tourists in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada requested the tourist industry of Mazatlán on the authorities, the areas which are in a poor state and a bad image of the port city, special attention to it.

"The politicians do not know what it means to have a company to close a day and you have no idea about how much money you lose. Because otherwise they would carry out the works slowly and haphazard not this way."
The hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of tourists to the lack of prevention and the lack of Instandhaltungsarbeitung from the city.
"The community must accept its responsibility and avoid this ever happening again. How will they do? Now, through a preventive maintenance instead everything afterwards," he said.
"We are waiting anxiously to have a clean city. Because not just because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we, too, people have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to get the city in a good state."
"There are other bodies, including ungepflegt and unfinished look," he said, "for example, el escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that their beaches and streets clean and tourist attractions in constant shot," he added.
"This provision was not enough attention and these kinds of incidents are the only what is clear for all to see: A maintenance is urgently needed."

He mentioned a number of places, the city should be whipped. Together with the city clean, properly and attractive for tourism, should be a priority.
"fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historic and cultural sites, the first to be cleaned up and to make it more attractive for tourism and the inventory, with whom we advertise this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that Members should the great responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a dignified Parliament, free of collusion zwiwchen parties and the government, as Sinaloa is troubled and is facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, a PT, one of Convergencia and even a EMPA. That makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of Congress are expected to make a clean work, committed to the society and different social groups, which are dependent on a responsible work, and that is not the same pattern of partisanship and repeat paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the entrepreneurs CCE Coordinating Council, suggested that new Members should the great responsibility, a model for a better Sinaloa, which is facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right, free of collusion between the parties to act, because it is customary that agreements with which they defend their own interests, they Karnevalskomparsen of those in power and the leader of the parliamentary groups turn."
He said that their commitment to building the necessary bridges, to support the current government should show.

"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which in any way the creation of jobs."
In terms of the tourist industry, he called for the new Members, they should give the necessary priority in the state budget to promote the tourism Ministry.
"I understand that it is the Department with the second most little resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity, exchange and investment into the country, and in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects funds must be allocated state security must be unterstütz and the alcohol law was not revised in previous legislatures must be updated.

The new unit will take place no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, the unity of the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest many observers continue to call for the creation of a public inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, minister of public security, maintains that this idea come not from yesterday: Quebec should have started last January, the New York Department of Investigation consulted on this issue.
The metropolis has since 1870 on a possible unity against corruption.
However, the announcement by Wednesday more than a surprise.
We have to say that this measure at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebecer police service on 29 October last year despite the presence of Robert Dutils not in the slightest.
It was also not that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Parti Québécois, this announcement as "from the hat in terms of public safety gezaubertes rabbit 'and' at a table at the end of coping gebastelte solution" qualified.
Ministers Dutil had in turn contacted those who fear that too much influence on this political power, future unity.
"It will be the result if we are contesting proclaiming," he said.
"We are aware of this problem."
Under Réjean parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the public opinion poll.
"The more M. Charest, insists on trying to prevent the creation of this Committee of Inquiry, the more people will like you and I think that he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way able to form a committee of inquiry, the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, lecturer in ethics and politics ENA systems (staatl. The senior administration official training).
In order to get out of this, it proposes the Quebec of audit control a specific mandate, so that these on corruption and collusion appropriate investigations.
"We should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also takes the view that the Quebec of audit control the same power as Commissioners, which could give it would allow people to testify.
The formation of a unity government is not the only project in the drawer Charest.
The Quebec Ottawa will also demand that the penal code to in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
These demand comes from the public prosecutor of Operation Marteau, the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier has informed that jurisdiction in this kind of prosecution is unclear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for public security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, are currently concerned this dossier with certain amendments.

The CCNR believes, M. Dupont and CHOI 98,1 FM team had the right to own expression, however, have certain statements "inaccurate information on social care and unjustified negative portrayals of the Haitians and such a ungehobelte speech also contained the daytime broadcast programmes is not appropriate."

The athlete, "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu) increase in the Kickboxen and Thai boxing make now in search of new challenges to the Tatami and into the Boxringe in the world.
"I have 12 years ago in Algeria with combat sports like Kung-Fu and Kickboxen started," said Zemmal since 2008 in the metropolis is located, in order to develop among the professionals.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, for those who fight the soil, as the joint fight that may not present arts competitions in North America are scarce. "
Recently had his label as a security officer working and the company UPS grants employees employed his rivals bad news, in which he between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland, most of the amateurs two World Cup gold medal from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) won.

450 million in contracts without tendering
Hydro-Quebec has in mutual agreement project planning firms 450 million dollars in contracts for the hydroelectric project East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium, consisting of the firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, the most important part of the project, to a total of $295 million without tendering has received.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was in 2004 as part of the decision-making by Hydro-Québec, the private sector their responsibility, this important hydroelectric project a sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 ergatterte the consortium "Énergie gérance" the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois is resorting to companies consortia a serious ethical problem that the risk of Wettbewerbsverdrändung and a price increase.
"This is a new way of conspiracy and refuted the competition."
"This means that rather than fix games instead of secret way now in open form," said Sylvain yesterday Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference.
Early in the morning Simard had raised the issue before the National Assembly, because it seems to him hard to understand how the public's interest in this way can be served.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had afternoon responded by vehemently deny this Treaty was that it had been a stitch-up.
"I remain faithful to my line," she lashed out, confirmed that the PQ was "dishonest" and "lack rigour".
She said that it "is the least" that the PQ apologize.
The model of the consortium is common practice in the world.
It is usually a time such a temporary alliance that it two or more companies their expertise on a requirement for a tender for a complex project.
The project "East Main" has a high level of complexity regarding his work from level.
The construction techniques is under way and should be established until 2012.
However, the Treaty was awarded without competition had taken place; it had already given negotiations.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec with relatively simple projects no longer constitute an exception.
As the newspaper Le Devoir "noted last week, is in the field of Bauingenieur- and advisory professionals used model of the consortium of government investigations.
A brief overflying the Quebecer companies register allows more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be consistent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau is working in partnership with the majority of its main competitors to Cima +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or include Roche and Tecsult together.
Any link, and there are several dozen, at one and the same legal person - Dessau.
What the consortium "Énergie gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular work force dynamism and hydro-Quebec this fact since the 1970s in a special way account pays'.
Réal Laporte, the major employers of Société d 'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement the nose on the fact that the Treaty on the project management after agreement was approved.
"If you make a tender and there are few candidate will your prices soar."
"You have two options: Either you do the people who see in this Mart and say: We will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is that the price is crucial, but the expertise of the people," said Laporte.
The consortium "Énergie gérance" amount appropriated is one of a long list of contracts on more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were either the hydro-Quebec or the SEBJ East Main-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert approved for the project.
After reviewing was the newspaper Le Devoir "more than 100 Ingenieurs- and consultant contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resources laboratories conferred between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 gerafft contracts, Génivar had received 16 Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "Énergie gérance counting".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
It is estimated the total to $449 783 344, including the Treaty with "Énergie gérance" about 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of "Parti libéral du Quebec well known."
Minister Normandeau had suggested, the PQ is equally connected with the firms that they "funded", before they specify that it was its managers.
Barometers verantworungsbewußten consumption - the "green" label is not heartening
Green, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence was at the centre of sustainable growth, but nor should manage the brands or eco-labels, which marked his election.
A pity, but in a media universe swimming, where information in favour of a responsible consumption teeming with: The barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to lamenting a brake his commitment inadequacy, as recognizable as showed the first reading, which was held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the use of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecer nevertheless seem to those who sell them, try little credit to pay tribute.
Two-thirds of the Quebecer population there is indeed little credence to the environmental commitment of firms, just as the green companies advertising, betrays the responsible Consumer Centre of the University of Sherbrooke sophisticated instrument.
Another verdict: Half of consumers is casting doubt on the credibility of the official, supposedly fair products annexed certificates, but also the credibility of the products and brands as disposing of closet, the barometer.
Along the same lines, the discourse of politicians on this subject will only 14.6% of the population of Quebecer seriously.
The information on Responsible consumption appears, however, important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently approximately one third of the Quebecer consumers.
Indeed dämpften void and dubious nature of the information the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is after the higher price of the product, the second part of the barometer identified brakes.
Moreover, a third of the Quebecer of the performance of green products and services, which is trying to lay them suspicious about.
According to one other communication already over half of consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and predominantly the brand of one or more products changed their conviction.
According to Eurobarometer, they had to 61% of purchases preferred dealers in their neighbourhood and the purchase of food grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the index of environmentally friendly consumption had achieved in 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as king of the recycling of trying to reduce its environmental footprints left by he cares about animal welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness seems still his car, so the barometer: Just 28% of Quebecer indicated in 2010 using public transport or the Mitfahrzentrale prefers to have to demonstrate their ecological interests.
Walking and cycling has also 39,1% of participants this comprehensive behavioral survey supported the stereotypes.
Bond for the takeover of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, the Société Angus and the parallèle called on companies to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris explains with a cooperation agreement, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developers society Angus and the company Parallèle, a donation of seven million dollars in the Kultusministerium belonging to acceptance of Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent had hoped this again its actual cineastischen function to entrust, apparently not receive what they have demanded.
The government has accepted, in this case, however, on their own terms.
Instead of the expected donation provides the Quebecer government rather a bond in less than initially hoped that a viable solution to create favourable conditions could, at least in the opinion of the state scaremongers entnehmbaren sources.
A first action plan and a question after 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the Bittgesuch, since the sums moderately downwards.
A proposal together with an action plan have already been approved by the president of the 'Société de Développement of entreprises culturelles "(SODEC), François Macerola, minister of St-Pierre sent the acts eXcentris guides.
Several days ago, he had to give her one last technical report.
However, The SODEC Wednesday was sent to the proposal of the Cabinet.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise seems to have been the Staatsspende really pushed aside.
Let us remember that the Quebecer owners Community cinemas and cinema complex against direct state investment to support the takeover of eXcentris revolted had invoked by the argument, the Culture Ministers have no financial assistance for housing projects there, which he does not sent to other cinemas.
Several other market participants of the segment heard but in contrast, substantial economic assistance.
Cinema chief Daniel Langlois had the self-financed construction of the cinema over ten years with great difficulty, the authors cinema in the premises of his cinema complex, with the exception of the Treasury could justify.
The lack of cinema, the independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew his clientele.
Société Angus and the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, is a privately financed Campagne, of which it is a sum of $700 000, in order to boost employment.
Since the spring 2009 continued only a single screen, to show films in eXcentris: Le parallèle.
The aim of future purchasers is the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the demonstration of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "The hommes et des dieux 'to reopen.
Christian Yaccarini but has the newspaper Le Devoir 'is not removed, and it ignores what he and his group of the revised downwards proposals keep them.
Mystery of the komplexgeschüttelten Canada lifted
The new American diplomats pipes were spread by WikiLeaks, to reveal the secret about what the United Nations under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans consider; they show but with the same blow the superiority of the latter open against Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats surprised that the Canadian voters at the ballot has not the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit by President Obama, the conservative government helped its budget from 2009.
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington yesterday publicly offer were spread more juicy details than mere substantial content, in which it has a very bad outcome.
A carved link on 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal Wahlkampage was in full swing, reported about what the United Nations is no longer involved in the operations of their political leaders discussed.
The great surprise of David Wilkins used in Ottawa, the American ambassador.
Mr Wilkins offers various channels this situation.
"The Canadians almost economic inferiority complex, possibly led the Canadian, political leaders, to talk about internal matters of everyday life, rather than the United States in this election the buck (as in 1988, when the campaign on the free trade)," he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, are therefore 'the proverbial Goliath this election: omnipresent, but potentially threatening, in order to talk about him. "
The ambassador understands these "deafening silence" especially since the two countries have close political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assessed, "should the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leaders to drive such a crucial relationship, the voters at the polls as a key factor in the sense."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business sources in Ottawa, sent communication, President Barack Obama on his first visit to prepare in Ottawa.
"Their journey will help support the continuation of government in the vote of confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, when Canada its first deficit after more than a decade, will be the basis of a recovery programme in the $30 to $40 billion is created," Breese.
Nowhere, he said that the government had to postpone parliamentary session before Christmas, in order to prevent Parliament from the the coalition would throw and the conditional continuation of opposition parties would impact on the quality of the proposed regeneration programme.
Another, from January 2008 and carved by Ambassador Wilkins wrote Washington from the increasingly negative image that the communication on CBC broadcast dramatic series from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about programmes as Border, little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or contributions for the purposes of Muskelprotze administered the CIA interrogations could see.
Yet another communication reported extensively about how Hillary Clinton remarked with her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner during their first bilateral meeting then asked whether Europe is prepared to certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have the answer is yes, but on the basis of an individual decision.
Àm at the end of the meeting, described the Secretary of State, "he was handed a document in terms of Omar Khadr, over a 15-year-old Muslims Canadian origin."
"The State Secretary, promised that the acts again by watch".
We are, after all, still to that tempers on the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very closely Stephen Harper adviser, had on CBC said that those responsible for this massive leak "should be killed".

The UN yesterday in Cancun a plan to regenerate the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction of greenhouse gas (CFC) suggested that almost a third of the additional reduction, which must be implemented in order to stabilise the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan adopted its position in the concrete steps to implement large projects in Cancun, the UN hopes to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
After yesterday's plan would the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the lighting on the Earth's CFCs be avoided if the white glowing pears, which has a monopoly of 50% to 70% of the market, be replaced by fluoreszierende or, better still, by Leuchtdioden (led).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of emissions of global vehicle fleets.
In Copenhagen last year, the big Abgasemittenten as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, the global CFC emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt downsized.
By This account but we should still withdraw 5 Gt, from now until 2020 to stabilise the climate increase to 2 degrees Celsius, in order to prevent this spiral out of control.
In the White glowing pears hole 95% of the energy in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reduced energy consumption by 75%, with the new LED bulbs reduced these energy needs two fold again.
The Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen keep on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those of manufacturers Philips has put on the market this week - incidentally, this society has attended the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a fervent pear, know what gives a hint of the savings of the Auswechselungsplanes, should be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that iese completely new light bulbs very little heat, they can also make a rule resistance work.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several experts have shown that Kompaktleuchtstoffbirnen reserves, because they contain mercury and therefore as hazardous waste dump, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers must provide an adoption agency.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, however, not the Kompaktleuchtstoffbirne, but rather the coal plants that emit far more mercury to produce the White fervent pears wasted electricity.
In the United States alone that coal plants 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits, which each country thanks to this international programme would generate.
Indonesia would such a billion dollars a year in buying electricity and save eight million tonnes of CO2, which means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose spiritual Indonesia would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast expected excited the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for "immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections of Ivory Coast directly after the deadline.

However, The Gbagbo camp counts with the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, by the ex-rebel camps of the Forces Nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of Ivory Coast, had confirmed that the part of the FN practised manoeuvres of voter intimidation in the north of the country had deterred the President's supporters to vote.
The whole election could be cancelled if the Gbagbo complaints lodged by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo's opponents, however, are now believe that the high court of the country was not neutral, as it by Paul Yao N 'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, denies any link to the ex-rebels, has the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect it, even if he is not gone so far to claim victory.
His Bündnisparter, Gbagbo blockiere the publication of the results, because he knew that he had lost; and to submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after it prevented the Electoral Commission to publish the results, seie illegally.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday for the crowning glory of the association and reconciliation process of a country, which for years was divided into two parts.
The United Nations on Wednesday, the politicians had the Ivory Coast warned that it could be held responsible for these in the event of any abuses.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of elections on 31 October, with 38% of the vote, compared with 32% for Alassane Ouattara, the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate.

Affair Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary role for Syria
Inland, more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, considered the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, which was held for "espionage" in Iran, the French public in breathing, appalled the diplomacy alert and akzentuierte the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the close scrutiny of diplomats from the United States.
The WikiLeaks and received by the newspaper Le Monde - American documents give some background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée the Americans had declared his strategy, which went so far as this advice for dealing with their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of Wanderern).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman not the release of Majid Kakavand imprisoned in France, and from the American justice because of trade with materials in the Iranian nuclear programme Iranian Gegeleistung.
Finally, they put the manner with which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to the purposes this idea to make credible, Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad have played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss, in a harsh light.
In truth, he had done nothing in that respect.
A telegram on 12 August 2009 redigiertes diplomats in Paris entitled "Iran: French comments on their way of dealing with hostage."
François Richier, Elysée advisers strategy, in the company of Mr Paoli, director of the Quai d "Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They told her French method.
The advised the Americans, all keen to do their own nationals rückzuführen which would forcibly detained in Iran.
"Makes noise", they said, 'articulated loud and clear, without going' the words' human rights', 'innocence, "" immediate release "in the media.
This is necessary in order to the Iranian regime to embarrass the very sensitive to its image.
", all the more so since you ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because 'silence solves nothing ", the debate over testing on unauffälligem routes, the Iranians are" masters in Ausweichmanövern. "
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is a "normal, Iranian tactics ":" Hostage taking for political blackmail. "
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss (from prison on 16 August should come on the day to take refuge in the French embassy ") for the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians' (230,000 euro) bail.
And he is announcing the Elysée antizipiere another hostage, a phenomenon that will "intensify".
The Iranians could "in the near future, another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens arrest living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison in 12 days, however, continue to be detained in Iran.
An information was circulated: The Iranians Majid Kakavand, whose extradition to the United States for illegal trade in empfindlichem electronics demand material to Iran, has been released from custody in Paris after a judge's decision.
The American Embassy is, as with many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which followed the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand bad news.
France has a horse-trading on board?
The release of the Iranian against the Frenchwoman?
At a further meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September François Richier assured that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, not only was "completely surprised by the decision of the judge," but have also tried it.
"It has a heated exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government can not change the judicial decision," he says.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remain under "strict" control of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisers elects a telephone number, again, then the American diplomat, the Iranians "is currently in the chair of the Iranian Embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran spares the Elysée not, through its efforts to make pronouncements and organised "flight attempts" by the media believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential role".
The Americans are watching this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation bears fruit, because several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of 25 August 2009 datierendes telegram calls "the media the French authorities".
What is so much "thanks" towards Mr Assad, wonders the Paris embassy.
"Despite their statements Lobpreis secretly to the French authorities, that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document also deals with the reasons that have led to the Elysée this fiction.
The intensive communication efforts "aimed at Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria to confirm," he analysed.
A 2008 launched policy then "by many critics in France and abroad was perceived as premature and undeserved."
"The Syrian role aufbauschend" Paris "Syria is trying to laud what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sowing discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy know this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have whatever".
"But despite everything we have thanked them."
"This should at least cause confusion on the part of the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss, back to France, on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy will receive it in the Elysée.
In a communiqué thanks to the President of Brazil, of Senegal and Syria for its "active role in the release of our compatriot
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law Cinderella, "called" 's subject, which it will ban young people after midnight online Games to play, by giving them access, so suggested government responsible.
A draft law that the online gambling operator is to call upon young people under the age of 16 after midnight to deny access to these Games, will be presented to Parliament in December, representatives of Education and family ministries.
"Many children play these Games all night long and then have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life during the day."
"We are of the opinion that this law is needed to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft legislation betrauter Ministerialbeauftragter the French news agency Agence France Presse.
The online Games were then again 6 o'clock in the morning.
The manufacturers companies had time to prepare for the application of the law, so refined it for a year.
The government fasser as well, the manufacturer, to ask for access to these games every day time limit given to those young people whose parents ask, added the person responsible.
He will also those people who want it, free programs available that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly by various events, associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also undisputed champion in global online Game-competitions.
In November, South Korea 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Ausrichterland
In a state of excitement because of suspicions of corruption will appoint the Executive Committee on Thursday the Ausrichterländer FIFA World Cup 2018 and 2022, a highly political election, in which the rangeln influence and lobbying are threatening to push the technical criteria in the background.
However, One thing is certain: The 2018 edition of King discipline FIFA will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold, (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spanien-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The edition 2022 will be something exotic; the International Football Association hopes, the first on the continent of Africa in 2010 new territories (Qatar, Australia) is to win, or its subsidiary in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea) to pursue.
The list of people who belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) is the degree of economic and political use of the World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are so until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise a hierarchy of candidates.
After the evaluation report of FIFA, the English, spanisch-portugiesische (2018) and American (2022) Act bessseren arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations for the 22 members of the Exekutifkommitees the election to be not so important.
The Sunday Times, forging the suspension of two members of the Exekutifkommitees (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu) at the start of the revelations, could just as well the opportunities for their own country cradle of football, ruined, the only once the World Cup victory, namely to 1966.
The BBC had given the ground again on Monday, giving it a own broadcast had three senior members of the Kommitees, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou under fire.
Reason enough to alienate FIFA and the English responsible to embarrass primarily with David Cameron in these last weeks had an intensive lobbying.
The head of the government hopes for a repeat of his predecessor Tony Blair successful chess train in 2005 for London, the organisation of the Olympic Games 2012.
Would this intensive use meet the image of England before the upgrade Kommitee again?
Nothing is less certain, because the Bush-Blair Spanien-Portugal does not lack assets with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in 92 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
But the economic and financial downside of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal to the opportunities of Russia, which despite its shortfalls in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become the weighty outsiders, increase.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided that the treaty candidly suggestion on the Bezichtigungen the English press "an unfair competition in the preparations for the vote" from the Kommiteemitglieder.
"You bewirft it with dirt, trying to embarrass them," raged Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, the logical favourites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA-Hauptsponsoren, the country seems a long list of benefits to Japan and South Korea, which is a very good project separately.
But these new nominations seem premature for two countries who had co-organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: The long-awaited approval of the World Cup by FIFA 2026 opportunities for China, the Asian to 2022 lapses.
With Australia and Qatar, with Aufwartung futuristischer stadiums had pulled out all the stops to the FIFA to pursue its expansion into new areas, however, these two countries a greater risk because certainty.
Australia might as well as Japan and South Korea by European countries akquittierten weakness of television rights (because of the time), the sensitive nerve FIFA.
Second mandate: The Offenkundigkeit
De Gaulle had really away.
Mitterrand had to believe that he stutze.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than that.
A mandate in the Elysée on the next.
The current head of state is so candidate in 2012.
But the Offenkundigkeit is the side of the Mysteriums, the presidential function, not look good.
We must therefore act as if the doubts henceforth.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006 the supporters Jacques Chirac, a third mandate is not excluded, without even to believe that.
On 15 November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in serious by his decision, "some time in the autumn of 2011".
On Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP members of the prospect of "two mandates thus would" let slip was a little Fieberhaftigkeit spread.
The official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President was simply remind you that the constitution in 2008, the number of five-year term periods to just two.
He made a statement that no announcement.
It is not the first time that the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have the worst seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
In May a new 2010: "Does not believe that I not reflecting on the later stages."
His words from the day before yesterday not to make him more candidates than the previous day, but also no less.
They should comment, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of Wettlaufes candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of competition with Segolene Royal, Nicolas Sarkozy, to reveal.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012, many members of the PS adopted earlier than to EU-diplomatic.
The bad polls on the other side.
The first time the voters would right a candidacy of François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to a survey by the BVA-L Express) prefer.
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion with the UMP," the Prime Minister responded immediately and careful about the environment.
"If he was a defeat as possible, he would not" candidate, Jean-Pierre Raffarin agrees with.
"He will always believe they can win," corrected Alain Juppé, with the Offenkundigkeit has resigned.
Euro: The ECB is forced to maintain their purchases of government securities
The last assembly of the Governing Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to identify opportunities as they emerge from the crisis, or at least the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to announce the end of the year to its conclusion.
The crisis of European public debt obligation, the Central Bank in Frankfurt undoubtedly can afford, even today, more than tense situation in the European bond markets part not exacerbating them--is.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde had yesterday during a press conference held by the ECB, active role for the solution to the state budget debt welcomes.
It has not dared to say whether they thought that the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its programme of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my memories of my reasons for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, ECB president had the previous day in Brussels during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament is not very eloquently about his plans, but instead, pointing out that the programme of purchases of government securities in the secondary market "would put and that we will see in the Assembly on Thursday," as the 'decisions.
Only one certainty: The ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases the treasure chamber last week by the ECB to approximately 1,35 billion euro doubled.
And, according to some traders leaks yesterday new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem since May 2010 purchases totalling EUR 67 billion.
Among the traders are the anticipation of a Weiterverfolgens the purchasing rate never doubted (see page 29).
The economists expect no more remarkable change.
If the bond deals of more than three months ago from the arsenal of the ECB will have disappeared, the latter is still in the unrestricted cash reserves to freigiebige type, and over a period of a week of up to three months.
The economists are already taken today that this measure will extend for some months yet.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will amend its programme on essential kind."
"Otherwise they would run the risk of new tensions in the short term," thought provoking Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"One For the course of the first quarter of 2011 nominated, progressive exit seems more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist at SAL.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention in the market for government debt ", the ECB should such a purchase volume of bonds to stimulate the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposure of European banks on the markets of the national debt in the euro zone, the central bank has no other choice than to maintain their presence on the market.
"It must at all costs to the Steller of investors in the market and so act to prevent the premature enthusiasm about the returns paid on the most vulnerable states," bezeugte yesterday an important bond holders.
Because if the soaring rates would start to stabilise the states even more to reduce their debt, or even prevented.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Berlusconi government is in Italy for cover
After a worrying weeks early, the situation yesterday with the decline in the Eckzinsen a little to 10 years.
A return to the deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the minister had the region, Giulio Tremonti, the situation as "unentzifferbar qualify him to expect a" weekend unvorhersagbaren "hear the person but was denied by immediately.
On Tuesday, at least had the gap with the German rates his record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk are on 263 points, which a certain Kopflosigkeit in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had his Ministers pointed out that the discrepancy in Spain at the German rates of 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, was, however, as "serious concern" by the "market turmoil and a potential risk of infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, such as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy, as Portugal is," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, the problem is the Absenz of economic growth and the attendant schwindsüchtigen the state, no longer able to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In future, an Italian expected growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate is examining budget with 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, it calculated the EU Commission, the budget deficit next year 4.3% of GDP (contrary to the will of the governments promised 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (2.7%).
Therefore the uproar about a new budget collectively, after the holidays to a total of EUR 7 billion could be used.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditors Olli Rehn.
On the hour Italy receives the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy is in order and its accounts are governed repeat we have for a long time," assured Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF is charged with Italy.
"At the moment there is no problem, either on short-term or long term, since Italy despite its high debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, A. R.) than from other countries," Stabilisationsfortschritte observed Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of the political Unstetigkeit.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi a motion of censure of the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the preferred elections already organised could be the end of March.
It is therefore a little favourable session before a decision concerning a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anti-crisis measures after
Christine Lagarde had it yesterday in a press conference in Paris to highlight: "I think that we are still on Sunday afternoon and evening: The Europeans clearly together, are ready and committed to defend its currency and its currency area".
Although completely relatively - the yesterday recorded withdrawal in the interest of European government bonds was grist to the mill of the governments and the ECB.
A normalisation start, however, is still not the case.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it had debt note of Portugal, perhaps the most effective target of speculators, lower today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, given the "political time passes much more slowly than the markets'.
The European countries, both the danger lies, well aware of this gap are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected and with their counterparts in the broader sense of the G20 is progressing well.
And this also in on the meetings of euro Groupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is the fate of unconventional measures to stiffening of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
What has the EU Stability Fund, whose executive director Klaus Regling on Tuesday in Singapour his Asian Tour started to investors in the Far East on developments on the crisis in Europe.
If this is not explicit Fundraising aim of his visit, he is preparing the ground.
The first Werpapierausgaben part of the EU's Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative entrusted to Reuters, the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF mobilized additional direct involvement by the fund.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, in turn, structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms to be added to the austerity measures but the effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both, and the other is at any price to avoid having to ask for international help, before they have their own budget set corrective and essential structural reforms decided that restores confidence in the long run.
The European capital donors have again about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was in Paris on 24 November in transit, had the first brought the idea that if the 750 by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, so the Union would not hesitate to resort once again in their own pockets.
Economists from Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European government debt on sophisticated player, judge, an extension of the EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
This means exist: The European mechanism launched financial stabilisation currently EUR 60 billion.
A council has all the opportunities to be closely examined in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.

Métro Grand Paris: First financial vignettes
Since the debate about the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it rains billion.
At least in the discussions.
We call this the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris in memory of the Société du Grand Paris is being built.
At the start of construction - the SGP MEPs to launch, the state has a Kapitaldotation declared of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this system is the sum of the SGP is then in the markets, a part of the financial sum to her twin.
Today it is finally reached first high bills.
The supplementary budget by 2010, this morning by the Commission looked at the National Assembly, the measures, the first part of this money.
It is two measures: The creation of a special tax to Erschließund and higher taxation of offices on the Ile de France.
The former, so remove Article 15 of the draft law, "the benefit of the public service station Société du Grand Paris."
This is the product of quantified: "This tax amounts to EUR 117 million per year.
Zweitere to modernise the existing company taxation: "This is a reorganization to increase its educational product and this increase of Société du Grand Paris's".
How much would the table?
A mystery.
This amount is not in the text.
Of the 4 billion is away.
"It is said that the fiscal resources to be allocated EUR 4 billion of the Kapitaldotation being added by the State and the Société du Grand Paris and for the project to be done," is the explanatory statement.
In the SGP will take place this system not offensive.
"For the moment when we recorded revenue (the two taxes, R.), you can put on three years of cover and then draw from the 4 billion," explains.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started, to note the 2014 4 billion for the budget.
This measure, the 4 billion promised one long will seek runs the risk of a very eventful, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Rachsüchtige hackers and emsige spies
The affair WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On one hand, it proved to be an obvious scandal dictator, a scandal, only a scandal in Sinner hypocrisy is the Beziehunge between states, the public and the press.
On the other side announces it profound changes at international level, and is dominated by regression a foretaste of the future.
But we are going in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every Act (prepared by a secret service any nation) exclusively from newspaper cuttings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi's throw anything further than what for months as each anyway to read any Journal (except those whose owners Berlusconi), and the frightening karikaturierte profile Gaddafi's offered Kabarettkünstlern had fuel for a long time for their Sketche.
The principle of the secret dossier should only be already known news is essential for the dynamism of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library, esotherischen publications, you will see that every plant (on the grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau Templer or the Rosenkreuzler) repeatedly exactly what has been written already in previous works.
This is not, therefore, that the author occult texts alone (still so that he does not know where news about the non-exist to find), but because those who devote to Okkultismus in nothing other than what they already know and confirmed what they have learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Also the secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (for example, it could otherwise be whatever editor in Libération), the only true considers what he acknowledges.
The Top Secret information on Berlusconi, the American Embassy in Rome sent the Staatsdezernat were the same as those who already Newsweek published the week before.
So why was such a fuss about the revelations of this dossier?
On one side suggests that any educated person already know and that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then the Government can call each other or a plane, in order to make dinner - have lost their diplomatic role and, with the exception of a couple of small have changed.
Any Ermittlungsfilmen viewers know this very well, and it is not for hypocrisy that acting to ignore it.
However, the fact to repeat it publicly, violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: The idea that an x-random hacker intelligence secrets can tap into the most powerful country in the world, is the most significant blow to the prestige of the Staatsdezernats.
In addition, rather than victims, the scandal the "Executioner" in trouble.
But we are the profound nature of what happened.
Previously, Orwell's time, all controlled power as a Big Brother pool, every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have proved quite right since then where one can control thanks to the phone every movement, every transaction, visited the hotel, the elected motorway and so on; the citizens would total victims the eye of power.
But if we see what is happening today, even the secret Krypten power can no longer control of a Hackers escape, to be directed Kontrollgang listening to unilaterally and will circle shaped.
The power controlled every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hackers - chosen as avenger by the citizen - the secrets of power in experience.
How can a power that is no longer able to protect their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is a hollow secret (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi's or Merkel's essentially a secret is free of Geheimis, because it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton empty secrets were meant to deprive it of any power.
WikiLeaks has neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wronged but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury, which has caused a big power?
It is obvious that the states in future no longer online information - that would be a reserved in the street corner angeklebten form.
But it is also clear that with the current technology in vain hope is confidential reports on telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out whether and when a Head of state in a plane and one of his colleagues contacted.
How could in future private and only for certain ears certain relations?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment for science fiction and Roman prison sounds, but I am forced to imagine the government agents in secret way preoccupied on uncontrollable march routes shattering, their communications anywhere else than the mere memory of order and, moreover, the few written information they received in the footwear (verbergend.
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: Basically the Spionageversuch of Watergate had less success, as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology as a cancer progresses, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telecommunications Count revolutionised communications had reconstructed the Internet a Telegrafen with (telephone) line.
The (analogue) video had the film allows them a film band for broadband auszukundschaften by forward from behind spulen and all could reveal mysteries of the assembly, while the (digital) CDs, today nothing other than from chapter to chapter to jump in macro-portions.
With the high-speed trains travel within three hours by plane from Rome to Milan, while this including of switching requires three and a half hours.
It is therefore not return to the car and horse exceptionally, policy and communications technology.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press to understand what secrets between the messages were forged.
Currently, there are the messages that confidential information from the press.
Climate France: How its financial promises nice talking
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the financing pledge quickly resolved (also called "fast start" or premature finance), which the developing countries.
And the rough French vulnerable to blandishments.
With the Copenhagen treaty the developing countries have committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops in order to convince its partners from the fact their commitment regarding the fast-start financing: Detailgetreuer report their Member States, press conference, big-events, brochures distribution.
The operation is remarkable and transparency engenders around appreciated for their intrinsic value: The developing countries and the society would like to see all developed countries, the same thing at the same level of precision.
The EU announced EUR 2.2 billion in 2010 to have released what they on the right path to Respektbezollung commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be according to the Copenhagen treaty "new and additional" in order to ensure that an additional deployment, without detriment of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the "new and additional" means.
While the Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain Member states, including France, to block the procedure.
Today everyone chooses The benchmark, which he considers the best.
The EU Commission has, for example, as a benchmark for those of 2009: The international funding are maintained, and 150 million in "fast start-up financing framework" over three years.
Other countries have similar standards, either on year or about conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France was of the opinion that the funding of all new projects "of the year 2010 are" new and additional ".
In other words, there is no guidelines on the spending of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Specifically, the sum total of French support for developing countries remain stable (or decline) - France, his commitment to the "new and additional funding."
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is still no rule, and everyone chooses his Rechenmodus.
Some, such as France, 1 borrowed €as being equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously this is not acceptable that the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investment (often linked to the emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology) cannot be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, as equivalent to a donated euro captured... should also be included only the cost of the loan for the capital donor country than commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in terms than the following consideration: it "respected" its commitment of EUR 420 million by 91.5% loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% donates) 36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to convince themselves.
France is the only land the EU that loans to a great extent.
Germany 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other things) their commitments to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €to fulfil their obligations, France just 10 cents and understands including a comparable efforts.
Fine Hokuspokus!
All in all, operates France in its fast-start financing with a double fraud: To part with a Weiterentwicklkung of action over the period and partly with the reality of financial support.
France manage to believe that 420 million "new and additional" has spent millions in accordance with its promise and saves EUR 36.1 million.
The manipulation of the Treasury (as it appears that it was Bercy has implemented the arbitrage) could entail a double negative impact; even EU internally (why the other Member states, with the donations, if there is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries is not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature funding only a small issue on relatively short time compared to the discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much in the massive machinery of the UNFCCC.
We hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is essential to learn its lesson from this first year of early funding.
In the first instance France could be a change in its accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, and in a spirit of respect for his commitments and the counterbalancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But especially France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing dispute (another key topic) and at the moment: You can escape the question of "Verrechenbarkeit" or the recording its loans.
France could change its position as progressive in terms of the issues to be as it is for other things.
The hope is based on the new environment minister Kosciusko-Morizet next week in Cancun will arrive.
A surprising announcement on the fast-start France and his vision of "Verrechenbarkeit" and the use of loans would increase the international confidence by nature, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarms - of children's pesticides
A child of 10 years, on the day 81 different chemical substances, this Wednesday by the Association Générations futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations) study published.
The Association, said that its results "given the small number of analyzed samples reflect no statistically significant value, but illustration nature of the problems", usually within four between July and September, had a nearly 10-year-old child to the meals consumed food plus a meal in the supermarket bought in Oise and Paris.
This typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as biscuits of laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The author is stunning: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or probable carcinogen and five classified as safe karziogen klassifizierte as 37 substances with Endokrinin-glitch, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer research Centre.
"Even if the virtually all of the cases the legal limits for each chemical individually taken substance not be crossed, so remove this collection but very well that the reality in which the consumer may be carcinogenic substances or substances with Endokrinin-glitch is suspended, is worrying," said the union.
Already At the breakfast contain only the butter and tea with milk, more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three sure as a proven carcinogen as more than twenty residues which can affect hormone systems.
The apple imported from Brazil than that provided for the study between meal shows traces of six chemicals, including one in France banned fungicide.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study traces of a strictly banned in the EU Insektizids said.
Furthermore, were also Hacksteak tuna from the Pandora, even the Baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the water, the analyses the presence of nitrates and Chloroform brought to light.
At the dinner was the salmon steak with 34 identified, chemical residues on "richest", and even of putting the meal in the microwave Plastikteller used was not free.
The final finite risk this "pollutant cocktails" for consumers "will probably undervalued," the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts "(EE-LV)," given the urgency of the situation has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the increase in diseases of civilisation ".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues 365 of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
