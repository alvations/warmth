The lack of snow in the mountains is concerned about the hotel
Not only the lifts in Krkonoše maintainers are concerned about the tracks without snow.
The lack of snow makes people not book stays in hotels and guesthouses ski.
That is why, in Krkonoše still are available free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas Eve and new year.
We have many visitors in our pages.
People look at the offers, check prices, but still afraid to reserve commitment.
"And if you call us, immediately ask about our opinion, if this Christmas snow or mud," mentioned the maintainer information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Those who want to spend in Špindlerův resort a new year according to expectations, not should doubt more setting aside the stay.
Those who prefer to save the money and put the quality of accommodation in second place, they can try waiting a few days.
Špindlerův resort hotel offer especially weekly stays for new year.
I believe will continue offering them, but shall soon surrendered and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will be sold quickly, estimated Jandura.
Ingotours, a travel agency in Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all dates in the winter.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remains free.
"Why already we have prepared some last minute Christmas stays" mentioned Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
Vrchlabí travel agency can still also offer new year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there is less free.
Sell very well the first fortnight of February, the remaining winter dates are also sold regular.
This year the interest in the winter stay is affected by the lack of snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting to see if there is snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountain without snow.
"If the tracks remain snow-covered during the week, the dates of Christmas will run out," view Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a bit easier to deal with the rooms in hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou; last year was more difficult.
We are approximately five percent better.
For the new year and Christmas, we have the latest free squares.
"Interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sold well," informed the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of new year placements are already also occupied in the Omnia, hotel close to the central parking in Janské Lázně.
On the contrary, in the most recent hotel Janské Lázně Christmas half of bedding is still free.
This January was a great surprise for us, since we are approximately sixty per cent of the capacity of occupation.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as falling snow, interest in the rooms in Krkonoše will certainly increase mentioned Erik Sporysch, director of the Omnia hotel.
However, currently it seems that Krkonoše hoteliers will they pass the desire to snow waiting.
Thursday temperatures should fall and if there is precipitation, in the mountains should be snow.
But then again rise temperatures, reported Jiří Jakubský of Hradec Králové, Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is that Barack Obama, the President with the reputation of the smarter as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of its predecessor, which he same took by the silly man comic.
When finally revealed his Afghan approach waited anxiously, showed that it is a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only in the same text is used several times the phrase "as in Iraq", they do not hesitate to use the title of the Declaration of January 2007 Bush to his own statement: "A new way forward".
He was himself, who three years ago criticized the idea of sending military reinforcements to Iraq, the country is experiencing civil war Bush. And that criticized as "a decision irresponsible, with catastrophic consequences".
The following months, however, showed that Bush field, captains recommendations-based strategy was the only possible and successful, so that today no mention nothing of Iraq in the news.
Bush reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favourable initial situation of what was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expected to repeat the miracle.
Masters of field again ask that increased military contingent upon all the Afghan operation commander-in-Chief general Stanley McCristal. He even in spite of the traditional subordinate relations underwent undecided at the White House to a harsh criticism rifle.
Requested 40,000 men in order to improve the situation.
President hesitated for three months, but not came nothing better, so at least tricked the general over 10,000 military.
Managed to get Europe promised you other 5,000, although he previously had at least 10,000.
Most problematic Obama strategy seems its goal, begin withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months to complete this procedure in three years. The doctrine of Obama generated responses offered questions.
Many doubt increased to give the same result as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: you cannot rely on anyone and no agreement has not been met.
Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces if they are used to change the head every day according to your needs.
Political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin village. After he remain patriarchal tribal relations.
Balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the confusing, even more complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences relationships.
Not even a State that is "capable of action", set a target the entire operation, minimum seems very real.
The horizon of the strategy of Obama hits by his volunteerism.
During the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who does not know anything about the reality you can believe that the military sent to war for the "return soon to house", will make some miracle here.
From the political point of view, set the date of the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, since the Taliban so deemed to be an indirect declaration the American defeat.
The last Summit of NATO demonstrated that Europeans have ever less willingness to take part in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, and neither want to explain to their electorate have security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affect the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions do not exercise any effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: trying to solve the problem with military force or not.
You will need to seek responses precisely when, according to Obama, America start the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each solution thus means a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama it is missing three years for the presidential elections, and therefore still have much time to find another strategy, if it is a total failure.
The Goldman Sachs bank managers will not receive the bonuses in cash
Senior executives of the American Bank Goldman Sachs does not receive this year the bonuses in cash.
The entity announced it to react to harsh criticism of their wage practices.
The 30 senior management group receives instead of money, actions that may not be sold at least five years.
In addition, actions may be withdrawn should have taken excessive risks.

Minister Janota considers the resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive the Friday morning to the Minister of finance Eduard Janota, which is considering their stay in the Government, since it is not in accordance with the version of the State budget for the next year, approved Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies.
Assumes the budget, and perhaps also Janota stay in the Cabinet, will be the subjects of its meeting on Friday.
The budget is also criticized for Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too great, what is deepening the crisis in public finances.
The event reported President Radim Ochvat spokesman.
About his stay in the function, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the law on the budget, ready to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163,000 million kroons.
The Chamber of Deputies, however, approved Wednesday left for transfers of funds and increased money for staff salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government is not in accordance with the proposals of the Social Democrats since covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the Government, Klaus and right on the other, was a serious internal conflict. Due to this conflict, are beginning to be controversial bureaucratic cabinet Fischer, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, ČSSD, and the Green party's future activities.
Critics claim that the budget in the version approved by the Chamber of Deputies, de facto liquid ahorrativas measures imposed in autumn by Fischer Government to curb public debt package.
Klaus can but do not have to sign the law on the State budget; today stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs politicians had long neglected "serious problem", i.e. "the unsustainable deficits" of public finances.
He now no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong Government, which can support on a broad consensus between the political parties, could improve this situation, believes the President.
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned, that the budget is appalling and that the Government should consider its future existence.
The Vice President of ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens clearly no longer works.
First Minister Fischer reacted and described as "strong statements" similar words.
The head of ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is terrible, prepared this year by former Government Topolánek. It will exceed 200,000 million kroons.
Wednesday ČSSD said that the adoption of the State budget for the coming year was successful.
The popular were also happy.
Mandela in the new film by Clint Eastwood, played by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new film Hollywood, Invictus: invincible, says much about the country, their struggle and their victories, although some critics say that the roles protagonists play them American actors.
The story talks about sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first Black President, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his biography on the American actor Academy, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, aged 91, asked that you play you in Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him: "When interpret you, will I have to have access to you."
Seventy-two-year-old actor received the award for his role in the drama of Eastwood on the world of boxing Milion Dollar Baby played the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which came to be slave, the fictional President of the United States, and even in Evan Almighty God. But rarely represented someone who is still alive, and for many people, it is as important as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in South Africa.
It was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word, and the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak as he
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, joined forces with Captain Francois Pienaar, South African rugby team to help unite the country. Mandela, the new President, know that after apartheid their nation remains racial and economically divided.
Create is able to join his people through sport, and why he decided to join rugby players belonging to the global extent to the outsiders.
The South African team manages to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela came to theaters.
Had another goal that play this role in such a way that was as close as possible to the reality, said Freeman.
Naturally, the biggest challenge was speaking like him.
The actor said that if he and the global politician were from the same area, had tried Mandela to meet, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that the hand tighten you receipt energy, it pushes and had the feeling of knowing how you feel, said.
For me it is important to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays the role of François Pienaar, Captain of the national team Rugby that predominated white players.
The actor said to have had six months to prepare for a role in the hard world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when finally met for the first time with Pienaar at home.
I remember having called the door, he opened up and the first thing I told him to François Pienaar in my life was: "In the film look like very high".
In spite of the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their actual models, and under the management of director Eastwood, Invictus: invincible received positive reviews and also deals with ambitions for the Academy.
Daily Variety Todd McCarthy magazine film critic summarized his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, very well-made movie."
In the reviews of films on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive evaluations.
The secret of the splendor on Norway resolved: the Russians made a missile tests
On Norway noted a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Ministry ended yesterday recognizing that near the borders with Norway was an intercontinental ballistic missile tests.
The launch failed again. The missile type "Ballistic", previously destined to be the pride of the Russian army, becoming first Minister Vladimír Putin and the Russian generals nightmare.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, was not flying or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers written "Bulavá" as "a missile that does not serve".
A missile that does not serve, but shines.
The 13th test, occurred during the principle problem.
At the end of the flight occurred again technical problems in the apparatus.
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulavá" was released from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which was submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the release from a boat that is moving and submerged at a time.
It is likely that the mysterious light on Norway, caused by a flying object not identified, was actually failed "Bulavá".
As Norwegians from the outset not hesitated in case of a Russian missile.
The overall this time they defend saying that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the fault occurred in the third.
In the previous cases engines averiaron immediately in the first stage.
Although none of the releases was completely error-free, according to the management of the mod only six of the thirteen were unsuccessful.
The success of almost fifty percent filled with optimism the generals and why still saying "Bulavá", one day fly without problems and even will carry up to ten nuclear hipersónicos blocks, whose maximum weight is 1.15 tonnes.

Hyundai fulfilled the requirements of trade unions. Cancel all the extra work
The address of the factory in Nošovice agreed with the trade unions cancel all the extra work.
Precisely because of the frequent extra work, unions said Monday the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Vaněk, Hyundai Motor factory spokesperson.
Address, however, want this year agreed with the trade unions a shift further Saturday.
We can not resign our manufacturing plan is essential. That is why we proposed work additional volunteer for Saturday, December 19, i.e. work in two shifts, said Vaněk.

The bonus will be paid by last Saturday, 28 November.
According to Vaňka, the company decided to change how to motivate their employees offered additional work.
Employees can collect the bonus overtime or may take a day off on December 28, i.e. extended one day the holiday season, mentioned Vaněk.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shifts will receive money by travel and food.
Extra work was the most urgent and problematic comments and complaints of trade unionists and strikers, stopped manufacturing last week, point address last night decided immediately to cancel all the extra work for the month of December, mentioned Vaněk.

A Czech discovery: an effective substance at the 'encallecidos' HIV virus
The team of German and Czech scientists makes testing of new compounds able to moderate the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this improved substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective a common variant of the virus, as some accessible medicines already.
The AIDS disease cannot be cured so far.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly extended thanks to a combination of drugs that prevent the replication of HIV in the body.
However, their use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, called resistant viruses will be created; against them, no longer work medicines.
Three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg experts work demonstrates the ability to dominate the resistance of the virus.
Showed that the substances called metalocarboranos impact on albumin, responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranos are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus of medications used today differently, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In his work scientists are new, 'improved' compound, knowing the molecular mechanism of bound to albumin virus.
The metalocarboranos have a unique three dimensional structure: two Polyhedra cage composed of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom in this case by cobalt.
A traitor and resistant virus
Proteasis HIV is a HIV albumin, and is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the proteasis of HIV, HIV fractionation occurs and virus corpuscles would not be created mature and infectious.
If stop HIV proteasis, stop the spread of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in a news press published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry journal scientists describe a series of compounds, in the two pairs of cages (see the table) are joined by a short organic series, which is systematically being modified.
A little weaker but more effective
The effect of this series of substances against proteasis HIV test was in measuring cylinder, and also against resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of the metalocarboranos in the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however do not lose their effect in resistant variants, in which the medicine often does not work.
The only effect, other qualities as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications mechanism makes, the metalocarboranos are interesting compounds for research in order to propose effective drugs against HIV, said Pavlína Řezáčová, the head of the laboratory of structural biology at the Institute of Biochemistry and organic chemistry and molecular genetics in the Academy of Sciences Institute.
Fights for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the approved budget for next year is "terrible" and the Government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, according to him, consider its future existence.
ODS declarations were identified by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
Say leaves time for analysis.
The Vice President of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Nečas the Prime Minister has to decide if you want to support in the minority, you are trying to combat the growing deficit in the Chamber of Deputies, or if you want to remain in his post with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of ODS and the social democración to the deficit problem is completely different warned Nečas.
The Chamber of Deputies yesterday approved the budget by 2010, however with the amending proposals by the left for more than 12 billion crowns.
The Chamber of deputies increased money for the salaries of government officials, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government reproached the ODS, proposals because they cubiertamente to increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS by the vote came out of the room and thus fulfilled the wish of the Government, that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget.
Disappointment and futility
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of disillusionment and the feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the Government will be to assess the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threaten the resignation on modifier proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to Česká televize Janota requested a meeting with the Prime Minister.
He noted that is looking to stay in the function.
The reason is its disappointment for the negotiations on the budget.
If Fischer is with another fight against the budget, deficit as Nečas in the Government have nothing to do nominees by the ČSSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also say clearly, if you will resign, if the camera adoption of other laws that increase the deficit, for example those relating to subsidies in disease, income, or amendment of the law of service.
Topolánek: Nominated by the ODS Ministers not to blame
It is the issue of first Minister Fischer and the Government.
Ministers nominated by the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in the text of the US News
He recalled that several ministries at the lieutenants some people belonging to TOP 09, voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed, that if is Fischer decided to resign the beginning of the fight with the height of the deficit in public finances, "is absolutely correct and logical support on left-wing majority, which is now in the Chamber of Deputies".
However so not cooperates with the support and tolerance of ODS members.
I have not thought about it, where it is the moment, I'll address this, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies the Minister of defence Martin Barták, who was appointed to the Government precisely by ODS members.
First Minister Fischer's afternoon went on a European Council meeting in Brussels.
ODS gave at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed, that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies probably vote against the amended budget if the Prime Minister not explicitly asks ODS members that allow the acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are young children, responded to the question, if ODS is not concerned about the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
Not realized me that my vote missing.
To resign from the mandate he knew, in the following months were of bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of positive, responded by same Topolánek.

ČD will introduce more links SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and Šumperk/Jeseník trains will run every two hours.
As of December 13 travellers will not travel to Bratislava in Pendolino.
The account by the regional rail this year: 200 million more than before
The trains are charged and paid for by the Ministry of transport, to cover calls Dráhy provable loss will be the year that is four billion kronor in total, just as this year. Local trains are commissioned by regions, next year will pay eight billion kronor in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
Regional trains are more expensive billion this year.
For rapid trains and local dráhy have a new contract for ten years, until now the contract was always a year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and perhaps why not increased prices for a large majority of banknotes.
Changes occur in only one day - banknotes ČD NET and cheap tickets Internet eLiška.
For travellers without customer price card ČD net increase 450 NOK 600 crowns.
ELiška price will depend on the distance until now there was pricing 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.

By entering the grass in the suit that RSA is regarded as something almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great acclaim of the white audience and recognition of the white inhabitants.
Football perhaps would help people to join and form a nation mentioned rugby player Chester Williams, the single "black" in the national team in 1995.
It will still be, if it improves the tense situation in the RSA.
The white South Africans are however sceptical, as for example in an interview recently for LN an amateur Rugby Christopher Dawson, who fled their country to Britain.
The Championship begins 11. June 2010.

Jančura presented a complaint by slander to three ČSSD hetmánes
The owner of Student Agency Radim Jančura today presented a complaint by slander to three hetmánes socialdemocráticos.
It is Michal Hašek in the Jihomoravský region kraj, Pardubický Radko Martínek kraj and Olomoucký hetmán kraj Martin Tesařík.
Jančura mentioned in twenty minutes in Radiožurnál.
The demand has to do with the effort of the company, maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions were however signing long-term with České dráhy contracts.
Three hetmánes we are attacking and talk about the fact that we are "taking the cake raisins", however only brought the offer for what they wanted.
Say, that we are more expensive than České dráhy, which is not true. We know the České dráhy, were set last week prices.
So we can only defend ourselves.
By slander towards society Student Agency, said to Radiožurnál Jančura.
He mentioned while the evidence of all regions. He does not have taken necessary measures in line with European law.
Why is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Hašek considers this allegation by the continuation of the medial show Mr Jančura, which serves as a free advertising for your company and for himself.
I am of course prepared to defend my reputation and my region and I appeal to the other hetmánes to do so also.
I suppose that on this occasion will demonstrate clearly that Mr Jančura manipulates the public on the subject of regional rail, using mentirosos and false arguments, mentioned Hašek.
Jančura announced last week that would spent several million crowns in advertising, whose objective would be to warn of such measures in the regions.
Radiožurnál told, that interrupiría the campaign after Christmas and want to continue after the new year.
Pointed out that the campaign will be carried out against the corupción as such.
Jančura started the campaign after regions agreed with České dráhy in maintaining regional rail links and for approximately 150 billion kronor commissioned not convened a tender.
According to similar steps Jančura disagree with the law and with the opinion of the European Court.
Jančura claims to have been threatened by a member of ČSSD, due to its criticism of the ferroviaro transport regions.
The only threat was that if we do not stop, we can lose bus licensing.
Presented as a member of ČSSD, I know, what Mr is, I am not going to say his name, said Jančura today for Radiožurnál.
Neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
Neumococal vaccine as of January will put an end to the usual customs.
As first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However already listed views of compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumococcus culminate.
The Institute of medicine is already setting maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts have also already it clear in the vaccination process.
The new vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
Beginning in January can receive free neumococal vaccine children born since 2 August last year.
The condition is not receiving nor a dose of the vaccine before.
The who began last year with the vaccine, or before, should also cover other doses of vaccine.
The first dose of the vaccine should be received between the third and the fifth month of age of child.
Last year's quarter of families left voluntarily immunize their children against Pneumococcus.
Parents but paid by a dose 1600 crowns and more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate children smaller.
Usually experts estimate, that the insurance companies will spend on vaccines of 300 to 450 thousand crowns annually.
Without however will save in treatment need to unvaccinated children.
So far the State spent by child immunization approximately 500,000 annually.
Cover vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
The pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Neumococales infections in our country each year die according to research in the hospitals 28 children as young as 10 years of age.
Apart from the Czech Republic the covered vaccine neumócocal in children was introduced in about 40 countries.
Is it compulsory vaccination?
However at the same time are opinions, this vaccine may be required in future.
As of January must be covered by insurance and volunteer companies.
Compulsory vaccination would be better, noted for example Rudolf Kalovský, the head of the Nahlas civic association.
His Association propagates neumococales vaccines already long ago.
Experts at an International Conference, in which our Association participated, were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the vaccine volunteer.
It is not completely perfect.
On the other hand we are happy to achieve at least this.
I believe that this is the way we now need to take, mentioned Kalovský.
The Ministry of health however does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against Pneumococcus.
We currently don't it think at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň.
The voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, say doctors
President of the society of Pediatricians Odborná praktických dětských lékařů Hana Cabrnochová společnost recognizes the voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks.
If all children would receive the vaccine, can reason about reducing the number of doses. "In the situation when the vaccine costs so high amount, relatively understand political decision logged vaccination as a volunteer," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from the year that is more than 80 percent of young parents leaves vaccinate against Pneumococcus babies.
The neumococal vaccine is a major change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the health, companies not by the State.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, then saving in treatment, says Cabrnochová.
The doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves.
However pediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccine had to be purchased by companies secure and distributed to doctors, as well as when the State gives other vaccines.
Some members however were afraid that insurance companies could "take the money from the health insurance".
Why doctors will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40 thousand per month, vaccines is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochová.
Still they and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular State.
At one time the Swiss voters asked prohibiting the construction of minarets and that there is an alert widespread on the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied on the possible integration of Muslims (which actually are integrating) report in one of the more overtly secular continent.
Some readers will come to this new workbook as admirers of the last work of the author "why the French don't like the veils" ("Why the French don't ' t Like Headcarves") (2006), elegant and thoroughly argued study of an issue that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still today.
The last book of Mr. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, wants to know not only what people are saying the politicians and the media about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide 5-6 million Muslims in France that Mr. Bowen called "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener that reproduces discussions between teachers and students on questions that matter most.
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or a city (or both)?
Should teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marrying a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use a banking system based on interests for a mortgage?
These issues are apparently mundane, argues, daily life, things which concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, teachers, and intellectuals, none of them renowned, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a scholar and Arab Muslim scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation is discussion on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
Unable to disseminate this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
Thinkers and activists interview Mr. Bowen tend to disagree with their counterparts from Salafi, supporters of the Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently has a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thought the French secularism and Muslim values may be compatible.
But the adaptation requires mutual concessions.
Questioned to what extent the French political strategists (and the intellectual elite so fiercely defending secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
Suggests that Muslims have probably victimization that Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make its historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, perceived "a setting of values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolate landscape of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other planet's Habitat.
That defines ice is melting at an alarming, taking life which cannot survive nowhere else rate.
The interests of the oil, gas, transport and fishing have focused on water recently open to diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a result.
In "On thin ice" ("On Thin Ice") Richard Ellis, a writer and Illustrator, paints a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Knowledgeable complicated history and politics of Whaling, describes the long tradition of the Arctic explorers who gave evidence of value to the White bear.
Admiral Nelson as a courageous Cadet of 14 years, only fighting with his musket, end meeting is certainly a myth, but others are real.
Hatchlings captured while swam in the bodies of their mothers newly exterminated were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus at the beginning of the 20th century, presentation showcased 75 polar bears at the same time.
Today, the Zoo enclosures are still generally a millionth part of the scope of an adult wild area. The climate is almost never appropriate: a bear polar resident in Singapore was put green algae which grow in areas without coat hairs.

Ellis uses accounts of other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters are the survival of the species.
Although it is banned in Norway, USA and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and Eskimo natives in snowmobile use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, is in the waters north of those two hunting Nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "after of ice" ("After the ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist gives an account clear and chilling on the Arctic Science and a striking look at how you can transform the future of that place.
It is that scientists have the answers.
Atmospheric scientists and oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
Travel Fridtjof Nansen in late 19th century and early 20th century pioneers gave evidence for the first time of the ice mass displacement.
After the cold war submarines drawn a map of the movedizos ice below of ice masses cords.
Satellite scans and extensive series of tubes mounted on the icebergs are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals camped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks inside the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by saline water compressed while freezes chorritos.
But from the bear in the surface up to the microscopic wonders of the interior, are all convicted once the summer ice retires, believed to happen at some point between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines between 6,000 placed crowns in the tombs of Arlington
PFC. Of ' Angello Robinson, 19-year-old went seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier who had never known.
He and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to decorate tombs, Arlington National Cemetery was a day to pay tribute to the men and women who once were standing in their boots.
In a few months, from where we are embarking, these could be us, said Robinson of fallen soldiers.
If we are, I would like someone to do the same for me, therefore only try to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers gathered Saturday morning to place crowns in the tombs of veterans in several sections of Arlington National Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Worcester Crown company in Harrington, Maine, kicked off the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington National Cemetery.
In what is already a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen make travel each year stopping in different cities on the way to officiate events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcester also founded a nonprofit Wreaths Across America, which has spread to other States event organization.
This year volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the tombs of Arlington National Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves in Arkansas, the Park of drums in New York City and the memorial site for Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania Fayetteville National Cemetery.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $ 150,000 to buy and carry the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, Westminster, said made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased military career.
While her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that this was his way of giving compensation to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way in which civilians can support our troops, said.
It's like visiting a family tomb.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked from broad meadows and hills cemetery.
Volunteers approached graves older of World War I, World War II and the Vietnam war, because you do not receive as many visitors as the new graves, organizers said.
The atmosphere was happy children played, while couples took the hand while carried fresh pine sepulchral gravestones.
Each outer ring was a deep green with a small red ribbon tied at the top.
Nearby, section 60, where most of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried, was virtually silent.
USO (Association for the soldier) donated 1000 crowns to decorate the section, but the grim atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends are supported each other in the Artic air.
Some read aloud names carved stones, while others would to see small black and white plates placed within the wet, mud for those whose graves have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who enjugaban tears from his eyes front of the tomb of his son.
Drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Sgto marine gunner. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . My son paid for this, he said.
"Long after my death I want someone remember."
Cuban officers arrested a US Government contractor
The Cuban Government has stopped a contractor of the u.s. Government distributed mobile and laptops in the country, said Saturday the State Department officials.
The contractor, that still is not identified, working for Development Alternatives Inc., headquartered in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients as the Agency for international development of the United States and the World Bank.
Consular officers together with the United States interests section in Havana are looking for access to the detainee, who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges not been made public, though according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be detained for almost anything deemed "in danger".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activity, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Government anti graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a burgeoning community blogger, directed by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has requested permission to leave the country to accept Awards repeatedly, but permission has been denied.
The detention of an American contractor can probably cause tensions between the Communist Government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama, who has been searching for an approach "to slow pace" to improve relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to inform the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new American policy emphasizes that if the Cuban Government take concrete measures, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average of a government employee wage is $ 15 per month.
The Cuban Government granted to ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile only this year, they are used for text messages as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited in the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign visitors of the hotel, and in any establishment of the Government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect, often have to give their names to the Government.
Access to many Web sites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, official press section, US interests in Havana, said most of the handful of u.s. citizens in prison in Cuba is behind bars for offences such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said it could not provide more information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly desacertados.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, as distribute mobile free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas organization Human Rights Watch recently published a hard report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, same Cuba", a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country, to replace his ailing brother major Fidel.
Vivanco said defendants are often arrested, prosecuted and imprisoned in a day.
Stated that any solution would probably be political, and that the Cuban Government often leads to a negative in the United States reaction when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials desenmarañan a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brain of a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops expressing hope that the case can help unravel a terrorist recruiters around Internet in search of radicalizados youth network.
The researchers said that they were pursuing a mysterious insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited men to Pakistan after discovering one of them commented endorsing terrorist attacks on the site of Internet YouTube videos.
Saifullah led the men once in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But an official Pakistani intelligence which had been informed about the case, said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the commanders of Al-Qaeda that men were not part of a plot by the CIA to infiltrate terrorist network.
Therefore, isolated them for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the imposing mountains of Northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
It considered them as part of a covert operation.
For this reason were rejected, said the official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said that the men not inmutaron and were even trying to get the proper approval to access the fields of Al-Qaeda, when arrested by Pakistani police authorities.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI, emphasizes the critical role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists, and perhaps what is most important, determine who are trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US intelligence has been as priority trying to infiltrate people within Al Qaeda.
The Organization recruiters act as guards, not miss those that do not show a serious commitment to the holy war, and those that could be spies.
Analysts said that Al-Qaeda scans with special attention to the aspiring Americans recruits.
But for the Organization represent a huge attraction due to its potential to access u.s. objectives and due to its propaganda value.
But the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, senior analyst Evan Kohlmann said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who support, because the u.s. intelligence agencies have become experts in its recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate anyone in these groups, what better way to follow the model of recruitment which so many already have followed? It was Kohlmann.
It has become a model based much more on the Web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate "action"
Saturday tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through streets demanding the negotiators working conventions Bella Center of the city center bolder actions for the climate here.
The protesters said that 100,000 people attended the event, but the police estimated that the amount was close to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the Centre of the city.
In one day just happened in the climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists walked city holding banners in English saying "there are no planet B" and a Spanish stating, "Earth says"already is enough"".
Several famous joined the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travel Peru, the native country of his mother, made me aware of distressing matters with which the country struggles to the impacts of climate change that are already happening. "
This is part of the reason why I decided to join the big demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, that presents a fair agreement, ambitious and binding, she said.
This is not an easy task, but needs to be done, there is no way to bypass longer.
The police prevented protesters approaching Bella Center too and said that they had arrested 19 people, mostly because of the use of masks or for porting of Pocket knives.
According to Danish law, those activities are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not be identified to be involved in discussions on climate, a few activists with sport masks and black costumes placed several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were buildings, he said, adding that began as flashes, but were followed by "a couple of large explosions."
Within the Convention Center, people met on television screens to look at progress throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials as Su Wei, head of China climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international deliberations, replied in English, "really was not aware of the situation".
Then went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is large, cannot hear what is happening outside."
He noted that depended on the perspective of each set if progress was to be harmful or beneficial.
He said that this shows the different sectors and the general public attention to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "also applies affect negotiations or other people freedom."
A test data reveal persistent racial differences
The federal ratings last week on performance in mathematics, book was very good news for public schools in the capital district.
Although district is still far from systems with better performance of the country, the book of ratings showed fourth and eighth graders gave strides at a faster pace over the past two years, with the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is recorded in the recent figures from the national assessment of educational progress is the persistent performance difference between African American students and students white, both locally and nationally.
Average scores of white fourth-degree the ad during the past two years, students grew 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but African American peers increased by only three points of 209 to 212.
In fact the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in the eighth grade remained essentially fixed down an insignificant point statistically 245 to 244.
Average scores of whites were not included in the results of the test, because the sample size was not large enough.
In an extension of six years, the box is not more encouraging.
The difference between the black and white students in fourth grade in 2003, when he announced the first ENPE in the district was 60-point scale (262-202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference is has just reduced to 58.
Some education in the district attorneys expressed concern last week, as it advances concluded by Michelle A. Rector. The Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic), were driven in large part by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we have improved the set in response to those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, an organization nonprofit advocating educational equity in the district.
I am not by Joy breaks for a difference of two or three points, said the Ad Council Member Kwame r. Brown (Dem-by accumulation), who has a daughter in the fourth degree of Eaton elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of the Rhee, management style said that scores of the test message is that secondary schools in the city have a desperate need of attention.
Clearly always want to see the positive signs, and I respect it.
But the concern is that we are not spending the time nor the energy required for our middle schools.
Rhee said the district needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of students from poor performance.
This autumn, for example, are training teachers to use a new curriculum of reading, the Wilson reading system, aimed at students of the higher grades of primary school and a half, not dominated the foundations of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes games and experiences of real-life, introduced in the district under the former Superintendent Clifford Janey, which is credited with some of the progress reported by the ENPE last week.
I think that we must continue working to provide better assistance to those students who are below grade, level only expressed Rhee.
Others say that the results of the ENPE are the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for poorly performing schools that will be necessary to reduce the difference.
Here is a species of rugged dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a Professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, studying urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate their resources and management schools located in sections of the ad's poorest reforms
Then the objective can generate political implications which run counter to that important schedule.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban superintendents, she is stuck in the middle-class black and white.
Our focus is on ensuring that we built an excellent school system.
We need to strengthen our neighborhoods, schools, so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children have access to excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week essential to put an end to the performance difference is extending the traditional public school currently 180 days in the district, year to compete with independent schools.
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, reached an agreement with the Union of teachers in a year of 185 days, regarded as an "indicator" to search for an increase in the next Convention last year.
Make education a part of more future
The tourist bus arrived at the Gettysburg University with a strong sniffle.
Graciela Rodríguez, 12 years old, fell and parpadeó for a moment before the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawns.
Graciela parents had just graduated high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, same Graciela, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a University campus.
Even so, when she and the other students in eighth grade group explored Gettysburg, where enrolment is $ 38.690 a year, his attitude was less impressed guests to enthusiastic potential students.
Itself! Here is where I will be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when guide announced that had entered the building science.
Man, do you seriously?, pensativamente, said when the guide spoke low ratio profesor-estudiantes school.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh child had visited on his trip three days and had already completely absorbed its deliberate message: the question is not if you go to College.
The question is which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the U.s. Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant adolescent, there are also hundreds of thousands who access to university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these "second generation" Hispanic graduated at the University, a remarkable given that many immigrants, especially Mexican and Central American, parents entered the United States without completing high school achievement.
Their success stories are important, say the researchers, because they indicate the way forward for a generation that will play an important role in the labour force in the country.
Who analyzed higher performance say that often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents that set high for children goals and find ways to compensate for his lack of familiarity with American schools.
But tutoring programs can also play an exceptional role to help Graciela and millions of children like her to reach the University, in particular if efforts are sustained over time.
Observing children of low-income parents do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not resolve this issue, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined to Latino students.
We must think provide a support network for these children from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program funded by the tour by Graciela universities is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, provides more than 300 million dollars annually to local school systems to implement programmes of University preparation begins when low-income students are in middle school and continue until complete high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent frequenting the University, according to the United States Department of education.
The Iraqi oil Ministry reached agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
In spite of the concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government managed to attract major oil companies to reconstruct your fragile infrastructure during two auctions concluded on Saturday.
10 Agreements the Iraqi oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
American companies moved away having bid in only two of the 10 auctioned deposits.
Seven u.s. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday.
The only submitted an offer lost.
Two US companies reached agreements for deposits auctioned in June.
The poor representation of the giant American tankers in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, there are Asian and European head, said Ruba Husari, editor of Iraq oil Forum, an online News Centre.
It will be long before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Concerns about security, stressed by massive coordinated bombing Tuesday, and while the US military are removed, political instability probably prevented the American oil companies to risk more strongly in Iraq, which has the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world, said analysts.
U.s. companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because the rivals, including Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the Government, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because it does not answer to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies reached agreements with the Ministry.
The main us as Chevron and ConocoPhillips signatures that have strengthened ties with the Iraqi Ministry of oil and provided technical assistance in recent years, moved away empty-handed.
Lukoil and Gazprom Russian companies were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The national petroleum, Chinese State-owned corporation offered in more contracts than any other company and managed large investments in contracts for two major sites.
We know that China is on path to become a main power economic and technological, said spokesman of the Ministry of oil Assam Jihad.

The main scheduler of Al-Qaeda was apparently killed in Pakistan
It is believed that a suspected American missile on the border with Afghanistan Pakistan attack has killed a main operations planner of Al-Qaeda this week, the u.s. the counter-terrorism officials said Friday.
Confirmed, this would be the second fatal attack against a terrorist leader of high rank this autumn.
Saleh al - Somali was one of the two Arab men thought that he has died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles impacted on his car, near the city of Miran Shah, Waziristan of North Province, according to American sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said missiles were launched by a plane unidentified type operated by the CIA in the illegal tribal area of Pakistan.
They were driving a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, when the car was the impact, said an official of the Agency of Pakistan, civilian intelligence talking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The officer said suspected local activists precipitated the place and quickly seized was "completely shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two u.s. the counter-terrorism officials cited unspecified proof that Somali was among the dead.
Described as a planner Somali military senior of Al-Qaeda, who directed the operations of the terrorist group out of the Afganistán-Pakistán region.
He devoted himself to conspire in the world, said a senior official, spoke from anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of American air attacks on Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiratorial attacks against the United States and Europe.
Had a strategic guide to the higher command of Al-Qaeda and translated it in operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Al-Qaeda and extremists in the region was well connected with other groups.
It may not be a name known to some Americans, but that not decreases in any way the threat that we raised us and our partners, said the second officer.
If confirmed his death, Somali would be the second leader of Al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three others senior.
Not piloted aircraft led by CIA attacks pace has slowed since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a count of The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decrease is due perhaps to a tactic by terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit its vulnerability while ruthlessly murdered suspected informants said the site.
The maximum in Kabul to waive UN Envoy
The maximum Envoy of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would resign his post in March, finishing with a tumultuous mandate which was undermined by allegations of corruption on the presidential election in Afghanistan endorsed by the UN.
Eide output happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional u.s. troops to Afghanistan.
UN Envoy said that supports increased, but is concerned about the American timetable for the military withdrawal starting at 18 months to drive other NATO Governments to withdraw its forces.
We must accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and send the correct Afghans signal that can rely on the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The compromise has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also lobbied the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants to work with the political transition in Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector, said.
Eide said that he was not resigning but simply fulfilling a promise he to his family in March 2008, spending two years in Kabul.
He said that he wanted to notify the Secretary
General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, so that would have time to find a replacement.
What I said is that it is best to begin to search for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a gap of two months between the output of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun to find a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say have been considering to Staffan di Mistura, a sueco-italiano citizen who recently directed the UN Mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led the UN peace missions.
Eide in Afghanistan position was put to the test before its former delegate, Peter w. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential vote in the country and cover evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminaciones, but said that accusations of Galbraith, who was fired, "probably damaged the mission, because there were already much scepticism in the international interference" in the election.
Eide said that you proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the efforts of assistance by forces led by the United States in Afghanistan.
Also prompted the leadership of the United Nations to allow his successor to hire more staff in the United States and other Western countries, providing to the Afghan mission stating that this would increase his confidence that their money is being used correctly.
EIDE expressed his frustration limitations to their powers in Afghanistan, holding cumbersome rules of engagement of the United Nations to undermine their ability to attract talent.
This is the case that the rules of the United Nations allowed me to recruit only someone from may, stated.
This is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon require "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for his failure to engage in discussions about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 troops in northern Iraq during a one week trip in areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, Americans shine importance to the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good choices in Iran, said, in answer to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such event.
One of the things I weighs is that, if we have learned from Iraq during the past six years, is the inherent unpredictability of the war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's political and military elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions also could affect the Iranian population in general.
Argued that "a package of incentives and disincentives" should be "to persuade the Iranian Government that they would be actually less secure with nuclear weapons", because "people will suffer greatly" sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by the spokesman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, management joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences "credible" if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications of the UN Security Council and its Agency for nuclear control, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that wants to develop nuclear knowledge for peaceful purposes only.
In discussions in Geneva, on 1 October indicated that it would return to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and would agree to leave a substantial part of its enriched uranium for need desperately for a medical research reactor fuel reserve.
Management has pressed for this agreement, as a way to build trust between the two parties and buy time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have been away from the tentative agreements, in part, say experts, because the Iranian leadership is divided in relation to the possibility of engaging with the United States.
I think that the tightening of Iran with the international community on proposals that actually agreed to at the beginning of October, has joined the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way that had not it in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians said gates.
President Obama has been as deadline of December 31 for calling Iran the proposals of rethink alternatives, even further with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Hillary Rodham Clinton, once called "devastating penalties."
In a statement made in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations reported that called on Thursday "accusations baseless and unfounded basis", on the part of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran, and said that it is willing to continue discussions with the United States and five other world powers "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, which was to return to Washington last Friday, found in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al - Maliki, to fly to the Kurdish region of Iraq oil, to meet with Kurdish officials and troops in Kirkuk governorate.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, in particular with regard to borders, the rights of ownership and partnership.
Gates urged both parties to reduce the potential for conflict, to avoid any delay in the United States, projects to reduce the number of u.s. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 towards the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate the Kurdish anxiety about the pending reduction. U.s. officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani, the President of the Regional Government of Kurdistan: "Preservaremos security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
"Not abandonaremos them."
A China ageing, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that sermoneaban them on the fact that "Mother earth is too tired to support more children"and"a baby but means a tomb."
Learned the lesson so well that when the Shanghai Government officials alarmed by the low rate of birth and the ageing of their city, population suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young people to have more than one child couples, his reaction was instant and firm: no way.
We have already given our time and energy only for a child.
We have nothing for a second, said Wang, 31-year-old manager of human resources with a child of 8 months.
More than 30 years after introduced a single child policy in China, creating two generations of children known to be plump, only sons malcriados, affectionately nicknamed "little emperors", is emerging a demographic crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen dive 1.8 children per couple, compared to the six when the policy became effective, according to the Division
Population of the United Nations, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over exploited 16.7 per cent of the population by 2020 to the 31(1)) per cent by 2050. This is very above the global average of approximately 20 per cent.
The imbalance is worse in the rich coastal cities with highly cultured populations such as Shanghai.
Last year, people age 60 and posted almost 22 per cent of the registered residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Committee on family planning and population city of Shanghai, has stated that fertile couples have babies to "help to reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future shortage of labour."
Shanghai is about to be "so old (not so rich however) as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," said.
A gradual relief
Written in the Constitution of the country in 1978, son China policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and job discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for his contribution to avoid critical pressure on their natural resources, while human rights defenders reported abuses in the imposition of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced women to undergo abortions, pregnant with a second child.
In addition, many couples have abortions by sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural proportion varón-mujer.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened his stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both the husband and the wife are only children, and in 2007 subdued many of their hard-line slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of research population of Peking University, said that the central government officials have been discussing recently even more radical changes, allow couples to have two children if one of the spouses is only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city in an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost of the tomorrow night, prescribing the families to have a single child, posters were replaced by copies of rules detailing who would be ideal to have a second child, and as a permission.
City Government sent to officials of family planning and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets below of the doors.
He has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have elected to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai officials hold noted an increase in requests for couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still is receiving only four to five requests per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, in spite of the campaign, even expected that the number of births in the city by 2010 only reaches more than 165,000 slightly to 2009, but less than the 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the municipality Caolu in Shanghai, family planning Committee said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don't want to more children.
They want you to give the best to their first son, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27-year-old and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would love to have two children and legally enabled to do so.
But as many Chinese have only health insurance and inadequate living that provides them with the Government.
Without a social protection network, argue, that option would be irresponsible.
In the West people see incorrectly of one-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, an engineer construction whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child of the couple.
Yes, we are robbing the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not only a political issue.
It is the money.
Other couples cited psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, human resources manager said that a single child want because she was also: "We were the center of our families and we were accustomed to all beware of us."
We are not accustomed to taking care of others and we do not really care for others. "
Chen Zijian, 42-year-old owner of a translation, agency explained it in stronger form.
For parents with two runs, middle-class to reduce the birth rate, stated, this is enough success to be selfish.
People between 20 and 30 years grew up seeing his parents fight during the early days of the China experiment with capitalism and do not want that kind of life for themselves, said.
Even a single child time-consuming parents, said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of his life.
Then there is space issues, "have to remodel his apartment", and the strategic "has to have a resume ready for better childcare when the child is 9 months."
Most of his friends are willing to address this once, said Chen, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, said.
We do not want to make too many sacrifices.
A group of the United Nations outlined a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the United Nations so far characterized by challenging postures and mutual recriminations captured renewed attention on Friday with the disclosure of a document providing for ambitious reductions of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations that carry on his shoulders much of the burden in the short term.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But he was as a breakthrough in negotiations that are running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders who will come to Copenhagen next week.
Prepared by an ad hoc United Nations working group, the text does not speak of how much money would the rich to the poor to confront global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for the key questions, including how the developed economies and the major emerging economies recortarían coal production, and what would be the limit of the global rise in temperature that political strategists would be prepared to tolerate.
This gives you flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, high representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote the six-page document summarized a negotiating text of 180 pages to concentrate on what the maximum climate official UN Yvo Boer described as "the great big."
Displays the profiles for a possible agreement in which industrialized nations recortarían collectively their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 percent, compared with 1990 levels while the main developing countries reduce their own during the same period 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the countries recortarían emissions between 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The EU also stimulated talks on Friday, promising to provide 3.6 billion dollars per year over the next three years to help poor countries to adapt to the impact of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
However, on Friday introduced the same kind of verbal Fireworks that have dominated the discussions last week.
USA, Todd Stern's special climate Envoy rejected claims requiring mandatory cuts in industrialized countries, in comparison with the major, if they were not financed by the developed world economies part volunteers greenhouse gas emissions.
The maneuver indicated that management Obama is adopting a harder line with China, to making the administration officials Bush only two years.
The United States will not make an agreement without the major countries in developing progress and take action, said Stern, who also regretted that the text did not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by outside observers.
Stern made his comments one hour later in that the vice Foreign Minister Chinese He Yafei, stated that the maximum U.s. climate negotiator lacked "common sense" or was "very irresponsible" by having said earlier in the week that the United States not would help China economically to deal with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the major powers in the game world, the fault lines have erupted both in the developing world between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States to face on their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that twenty-four countries of the world most influential are ignoring the imperative scientist to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate, stated that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should afford the costs to limit greenhouse gases while vulnerable countries have become more aggressive looking contain major issuers responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game which is developing a new economic hegemony, held Ulate, who also works as a regional advisor on climate change in Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated would continue pushing for a legally compulsory in Copenhagen Treaty even though most of the major participants say that talks will produce at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of small island States, which has forty members, prepared a preliminary Treaty of 24-page proposal early in the morning of Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission said that the thrust of the Small Island Nations has "got political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now consolidated and call for action economies such as China and India.
The talks took a new urgency while the delegates focused on the fact that must be resolved most of the outstanding issues before the heads of Government to reach a deal.
High level officials as the Chinese vice Minister and the Minister of environment Indian Jairam Ramesh descended the aircraft and ran into the corridors of the Bella Center meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, to delimit claims negotiated during the next week.
The absolute mess meeting (where each day 13,000 people entering and leaving the Convention Centre, activists played guitar presented nightly shows mocking of the countries which they are selling, and passed preliminary proposals in hand in hand rather than via email), poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here now and Wednesday 60 heads of Government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering, Major League said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, Vice President for global conservation international policy.
Heavy weights are coming.
The first train to 225 Britain kmh redefines this feeling of Monday
At the Monday morning 5.13, a whistle perforará darkness to signal output train that marks a revolution for travel in the UK.
High speed of the country's first interurban train will reach the 225 kmh, when you pass as a ray from Ashford, Kent, to the station of St. Panrcas in London, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary for transport, will you join then Dame Kelly Holmes on first intercity service Javelin outside of London.
He hoped that the new service connect eventually to Britain to an international network of fast, reliable, train and connect the large conurbations in the Midlands and northern Scotland to London.
Neglected remote areas become prosperous suburbs, business travel times acortarían and change of aircraft and cars to the railways reduce national carbon emissions as well as exonerate the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this view.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears on environmental damage, can stop still Britain high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), created in January to provide the Government with a study of feasibility, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, as knew the times.
This will give you a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
New line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters in urban areas and areas where environmental impact might be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn in a radius of 25 meters a short route.
It is also expected HS2 set three options for a network wide high-speed going North.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The favoured option that is being proposed is a configuration form of Y, in which one line high speed reached the West Midlands.
The line was divided in or near Birmingham, with a branch running West from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and another northeastward to Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would come to Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railway.
Once completed, journey between London and Edinburgh times would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first section, which is not open by 2025, would allow passengers travelling between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to little more than a current time.
The proposals would allow trains travelling to 402 kmh, became the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is designed to support 400 mt long, capable of transporting 1,100 people trains.
At least 18 trains operate every hour in London-Birmingham line.
This means that you would be able to receive 20,000 passengers per hour London terminal.
Whereas the capital space constraints, is expected to expand an existing station to suit high speed network.
The railway industry experts argue that only the St Pancras International station or Euston offer this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if believed that the scheme should be, but a wide public consultation and planning procedures mean not take a final decision until after a general election.
Even if launched the work, the network should be build in sections.
At the beginning would require trains to stop the fast lines by the existing lanes North of Birmingham, maintaining journey between London and Scotland's three-hour times.
This is considered necessary to ensure a change of aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the rail revolution crucial point.

Johnny Hallyday had already been submitted to a coma induced by doctors hospital Cedars-Sinaï Los Angeles, where he joined Monday by infection, sequel to a herniated disk operation on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was operated once more night on Wednesday to Thursday from serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.

The operation could not be provocarhemorragias and portanto, no need for drainage, he added.
Anyway, the singer, whose health problems are multiplied since the summer tour entered a parenthesis.
Without a doubt, resume the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, I think very risky said Camus.
The UDF Association raises the pitch and warns new Center on the use of its acronym
The Association UDF (Union for French democracy), controlled by François Bayrou (democracy) MoDem, reacted this Friday when the President of the new Center, Hervé Morin, launch a takeover bid (IPO acquisition) attempt on the symbol of the former party giscardista stating him to withdraw all support, under penalty of being sued.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to retrieve the acronym UDF, as it considered that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend its political after having tended on the left hand inheritance.
In addition, the Minister of defence, whose party is associated with the UMP planned confirm the strategy on Saturday at the National Council of the NC.
In support of its management, received help from the Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, current NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF, mark was the first to register it with the National Institute of industrial property in 2004.
But the Friday night, the Office of the Association UDF, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou unwilling to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the Deputy stating them to renounce the acronym and transfer the rights of ownership of the mark, on pain of lawsuit.
The last few days, you have made many statements suggesting that they would propose its political movement to retrieve the acronym UDF, writes the Association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the Bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle of Sarnez of the MoDem, as also Senator Jean Athuis of the centrist Alliance.
Also believe right to continue using the name of the movement, the Nouveau centre, and the l ' UDF slogan d'aujourd ' hui in his militant material and presentation of your site page argue the signatories of the letter.
As you know, have no right to use the acronym, explains UDF calling the CN to remove Office "immediately mention the name of the UDF all support as (your) website".
Also called Hervé de Charette "to transfer ownership of (the) mark to the legitimate successors".
Otherwise, apelará justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In the letter, require that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and remember that Morin and his friends "chose" go in 2007 "to create a new party, as had already made it others in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore new Center does not have, according to them, any right to use the acronym UDF.
Also remember that the last Congress of the UDF voted 2007 joining the MoDem for three years and the creation of an Office of defending "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, continues the Office "when registered the trademark", was not a "member of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulent way leverages the absence of registration of the acronym UDF to do so on their own.
This indiscretion is transforming in crime, reported by circumventing the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, is more worthy to do his own name than trying to exit the anonymity fraudulently taking a name that is not right".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be judged by abuse of weakness
This Friday the Court of France decided to trial the artist François-Marie Banier to determine if, as stated in the daughter company Liliane Bettencourt, took advantage of the weakness of the octogenaria State to plunder of part of his fortune.
62-Year-old photographer known for his photos of stars of the show, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime which sentence consists of a maximum penalty of three years in prison and 375,000 euros fine.
This means that in this case there will be a worthy of a saga about one of the richest in France, where mother and daughter are held the reins of the rule of cosmetics L ' Oréal families process.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, was undergoing a medical examination carried out by three medical professionals.
The heiress and main shareholder of L ' Oréal always refused to undergo such tests, even more in the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Prosecutor during the investigation.
The doctors appointed this Friday must submit a report by 10 March 2010 in which must be recorded if Liliane Bettencourt suffered weakness and during which States.
I think that you will accept.
I will talk to her, said Mrs Bettencourt, Georges Kiejman, lawyer to leave the audience.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, was pleased by the decision of the Court.
This is excellent news (...) the survey shows that he (Banier) manipulated this major Madam, whom we must protect, said.
For two years, the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt began prosecution against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist multifaceted, accusing him of having taken years the weakness of his mother for billion in donations through checks, contracts of life insurance or works of art.
For its part, Liliane Bettencourt always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom he considered a long-standing friend.
On Friday, while the Court looked at the source of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, allegations of lawyers were, in some cases, a large family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt lawyer took into account three letters that his client would send (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to your notary in which said suspicious husband Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the year 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "could explain to my daughter that wrote you to Banier between one and two times per day for 15 years."
"From her wedding ever could again talk to Françoise".
For its part, the Nanterre Prosecutor considered, once again, that the applicant was not able to appear, much more that an appeals judge refused, in recent days, to make room for your request to open a procedure for judicial protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full ability to bring to justice, not under guardianship and has no guardian."
"Another person may appear in its place," said the representative of the public prosecutor, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided would that be pronounced once made the trial the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain...
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the direction of large companies with employees remembers the position of companies with respect consumers before marketing revolution: it's employees to join "values" determined from above as before it was imposed on the consumer products designed by factory technicians.
To customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution given instead to the conquest of markets strategies... Although the temptation to authoritarian impose products that are unrelated to the factors of customer preference is repeated on a regular basis.
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralization.
The suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously committed all intellectual functions company, R D, and even more, the business intelligence development.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "requires all parties involved (...) to take a proactive behaviour and a prospective vision"; a commitment to oppose an authoritative address recommendations fully it needed for employees.
That is why we call a management revolution, which would be put employees at the Centre of concerns the company as well as the client.
Internal opinion surveys have a relative utility
Internal, opinion polls as the questionnaire made by Orange between their employees will be prompted to the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I fear that do not.
-In principle, because I could verify that faced a new situation, and after many twists and turns, companies end doing essentially... so that always made! B989
-Secondly, because the authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows proportionally to the importance of their own failures.
-Finally, because the majority of the directors have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
As coming from the great schools of engineers, interpreted the psychology of mechanistic manner.
Taken by intellectual comfort, old behavioral theory u.s. "neuroscience" recently reactivated, and studies institutes and the media disseminated widely to their backs.
In this way, to suggest that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) the commitment of executives, recent research from Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms managers a mechanistic, unsuitable to today's world management position.
Identify and measure the factors of mobilization
On the contrary, the necessary managerial revolution for the functioning of modern companies is take a view finalist of human behavior.
It is to integrate in any reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, the company's commitment is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to carry out part of your dreams, ambitions, and projects.
Today, only from studies of analysis Motifuncional adopt this concept of employee motivations.
Studies showed that they judge your company on the basis of a default doxa that allows, from the image they have of the company, evaluate what this offers them to achieve their own life projects.
The identification and measurement of mobilizing factors business managers can control, provide for and anticipate its "social performance", and relocate the human derecursos "in-place management.
In this way, create a favorable development organized a strong and effective business intelligence area.
Oslo speech: "just war" Obama receives praise from the right

We must stop the terrorists, noted.
Obama, who inherited the wars of his predecessor George w. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, was dedicated on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the President had "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think that the speech was really well, was pleased the former President of the House of representatives, which appreciated in particular the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
At times, the speech seemed very historical said Gingrich, during an interview on the radio "The Takeaway" program.
The former elected representative, which some consider as a possible candidate for the Republican investiture presidential election in 2012, was pleased to listen to "a left President" when reminded members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free nor may deliver a prize of peace if the use of force does not exist".
According to Michael Gerson, author of the speeches of George w. Bush and current columnist at the Washington Post, Obama made "a very American speech".
Well presented as "citizen of the world" as"always", "spoke as a US President" to remind Europeans "living in a bubble of security they not created and did much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few right not very convinced, a Hawk of the era of Bush, the former Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, described as "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" discourse in the National Review Online's Internet site.
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
When we cover the war with the notion of Justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of the innocents, warned.
However, the left Centre Press praised the President.
The Los Angeles Time, although it continued to believe that Obama was awarded the Nobel prematurely, called his "blockbuster" speech to a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo speech "should serve as road map to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression", Californian newspaper said enthusiastically.
Obama "made the speech that it was necessary", felt the New York Times, "at once dark and edifying" judging.
Road transport: three negotiations maratónicas to guarantee the supply of Christmas
After of three session negotiations maratónicas, unions in the road sector and TLF (transport and logistics of France), the only employer organization remained until the end, reached an agreement ending slogan strike and the threat that falls on Christmas supply on Friday afternoon.
During the session of signatures, Friday night the Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau, was "pleased" by the agreement, after several sessions of negotiations began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators fired Friday hoping to quickly sign the text according to late in the morning dawn.
Even though three employers (FNTR, Unostra, other) were withdrawn by a door.
A meeting of more than six hours began at 11 h was necessary so that everyone must agree and the text signed the 18 h.
The conflict "it would have been very damaging for companies" and "it was feared that you disturb the holidays of the year," said Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase of 4% for wages lower (in the local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
Hourly rate rises 8,72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It is not much, but we start with great disadvantage, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
If so, we will give the order to our activists of no more cuts or locks in supply centers.
But there some dissenting rebel can always be added.
Philippe Grillot, President of the TLF acknowledged it was "a good agreement", although it was "difficult to grant high wage increases, taking into account international competition".
According to him, the increases will be in the order of 170 euros a month for low wages and EUR 100 to 120 for the highest.
It is an agreement with common sense and respects to employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized him as a "historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) is "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in the travel expenses of 3% and the holding of general assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010 that will above all enable issue special pay and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that "a EUR 100 million decline in employer burdens" was the subject of an amendment of the Government in the finances of rectification Bill for 2009, the National Assembly voted Thursday night.
The Government prompted the Senate to vote it "under the same terms".
AT signature allows the agreement applied to, firstly, adhering to this organization and, secondly, to the profession, companies should the Minister of labour then an extension.
It will be "promptly", said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers could only delay the process.
The FNTR claimed that it was a "naive business" that EUR 100 million "already had been promised to the sector to compensate for the CO2 tax part".
The Secretary State transport forced us to negotiate in a situation of urgency, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but to not oppose those who wish to eat Turkey next dinner on Christmas Eve, regretted the Unostra.
For the other, the agreement puts at risk "stability of many SME sector" during the next 12 months.
RER: conflict over the weekend, conforming unions with the RATP proposals
Conflicts in the RER A line of France's largest urban public transport will be continued over the weekend, because at the meeting of the Friday, 2 2nd ninth day strike between unions and management of the RATP, there was no agreement and trade unions were dissatisfied regarding your order premium.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, Saturday and Sunday will only run trains between 10 h and 20 h, by a train in two in the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and a train of four other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require passengers to change train.
The Galeries Lafayette, expected 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced in that "the RATP do by service stores".
RER A crosses from West to East Paris City.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre until Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-la-Vallée.
This Friday, about one in every two trains circulated in hours tip, and almost no train in hours Valley, as expected.
On Thursday there disorder platforms through the Organization of the people of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less busy than normal, especially by the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old engineer explained had lifted "an hour and a half earlier to schedule".
Saint-Lazare station not saturated, indicated the SNCF, planned by the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A, which operates from SNCF Cergy-le-Haut or destined it arrived or leaving Saint-Lazare station to join the meters.
New general assemblies of striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The "unsatisfactory" results will be analysed according to trade unions, a meeting held with the address on Friday afternoon.
The director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific Protocol in all aspects for RER: time, professional development, etc.
Isn't that what they want to drivers who are calling for a premium owed them, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP puts even parentheses its premium proposals, commented outraged the CGT, noting that the address was"not able to resolve a problem that the railway and road sector had already fixed".
Expected a new meeting on Monday for "most extensive on the conditions of exercise of the profession analysis", pointed out the RATP.
That also led unions to say that the company "not imported you the weekend users".
In the morning, around 150 drivers invaded a Committee at Headquarters, in Paris.
Then the address negated until then a dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could be extended to RER B on Tuesday, when the Unsa and the Indépendants submitted a notice.
Unions call for a premium of EUR 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the deterioration of conditions of work in this line with a million passengers daily.
RER, all in the second degree of his professional career, drivers charged and 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross premiums schedules with alternating shifts, EUR 600 to 650 Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice dissolves the prokurdo party, a decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court failed on Friday for the dissolution of the prokurdo party in the country, a decision which immediately caused expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, South-East of the country, and Istanbul.
This decision could much complicate the task of the Government, you just hand you a Kurdish community trying to end of 25 years of conflict.
The company party democratic (DTP) was disbanded because it had become the "focus of activities that harm the independence of the State and indivisible unity", declared the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations to the press.
The decision of 11 judges was unanimous, but only needed a majority of seven votes for the dissolution, indicated Kiliç, and added that the leaders of the party, including its President Ahmet Türk and Member Aysel Tugluk, 37 are sections of political life for five years.
The judge also announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity which enjoyed Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of property of the Party of the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in the Parliament (550).
Their leaders warned before the verdict that members would leave Parliament be parliamentarians without partisan tag.
The decision arises from a procedure launched the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accuses the DTP obey "principles" of the Party of workers of Kurdistan (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and by many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.
However, the party ensures that it has no "organic links" with the PKK, but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organization, and invites the Government to negotiate with him.
The verdict of the Court made a statement at the time that the Government tends him a hand to the Kurdish community proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights to the Kurds to stop supporting the PKK and an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders affirmed a dissolution would generate a resurgence of tensions in the South East Anatolian, where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan, Chief degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of Justice, thousands of demonstrators gathered in front the premises of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the great city of Southeast populated by Kurds.
The forces of order threw tear-gas grenades and used water cannons while protesters were Molotov bombs or stones with slings.
In Istanbul also focused 100 people about.
After the verdict, Türk said that the decision of the justice system was going to "further discouragement".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by a party, declared to the press.
The Government formed by a party from the Islamist movement also regrets the decision.
In principle opposed to the closure of parties.
Thus does not resolve anything, stated the Minister of energy, Taner Yildiz.
This decision boycotting completely democratic opening by the Government, says political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We hope, of course, a reaction of the PKK, added.
On Thursday, the PKK was awarded an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, was considered as a secret, inaccessible city for Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a tightly guarded secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216.000 inhabitants located 37 km from the Centre of Moscow, is regarded as "Silicon Valley Russian".
There are important centres of research and production of micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, Selenogrado representatives have contacted headquartered in Frankfurt, Riedberg scientific university institutes and companies in the Centre of Frankfurt innovation (FIZ).
There were various mutual visits and now, on Wednesday, Selenogrado and Riedberg sign a "close collaboration Protocol" in Frankfurt.
The Vice-alcalde Muscovite Juri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrado, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; by Frankfurt Edwin Schwarz signed the head of planning services.
In 2010, will travel to a workshop in Selenogrado the FIZ representatives and managers of small and medium-sized companies in natural sciences research center.
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But also addresses trade relations.
The FIZ companies will be able to set foot in the growing Russian market.
To change the Russian scientific companies want access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is the headquarters of major corporations and Russian research institutes.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of electronic technology, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika consortia.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "socialist planning city" for weapons research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green city") was the landscape of wooded mountains named settled research facilities.
Stuttgart brakes
Stuttgart 21 dimension is placed not high enough.
For the supporters of the project it is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe".
The law so. S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station, a monstrous construction project, which precipitated the capital of the region of Banden-Württemberga a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminals with Rails, ending in the middle of the city were then fossils of the 19th century, acting as a modern traffic, brakes that formerly needed an enormous amount of time to engage the locomotives back engineering forward.
Shoot, stop at dry continue their journey; but it must do.
And why would disappear terminals: Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a station, which lies approximately half of the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually initiated, while the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even more ambitious designers have known that in capitals Hessian and Bavarian is almost invaluable to implement the reduction.
Railway terminals of course also have more problems and out, since there are reversible locomotives with drive tractor and car driver on both ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 including the new section built ICE towards Ulm already will be initiated.
Communal and federal politicians have made this as well.
The railway is also because the risks of individual projects large infrastructure of the Republic takes them to the taxpayer, and not the State.
From urban planning point of view, the project still justified to some extent.
Creates new urban, many green areas, probably of the graphs generated by the designer computer space.
The S21 is harmful for the rail transport system.
The station and the road support are intended for the carriage of passengers, which was attributed to the typical growth of the 1980s.
At the time did not competition from low-cost flights.
But the first modern transport policy must deal with strengthening the transport of goods, as the railway transport is considerably more environmentally-friendly than by trucks on the roads.
However, the new sections under construction we are good for train load due to intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other rail projects.
More than six billion euros should be buried in the Kingdom.
This is the official figure.
The experts consider that it is more realistic between 10 and 15 billion.
Certainly, in the next decade, the money will be in other crossings and narrow passages in the network.
Total sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 km long rail from the Rhine Valley.
The path to slow pace is constructed since 1987.
It is urgent to here set foot on the accelerator properly.
However the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Valley of the Rhine shall be bottleneck for the international carriage of goods: from the heart of Europe.
The Government reviews the judgment on the airport.
The federal Government no longer pending in the autonomous community of Wiesbaden, whether to appeal against the judgement on the prohibition of night flights of the administrative tribunal of Hesse Parliament.
The CDU/FDP Coalition seems to have commissioned experts research legal judgment of VGH, of more than 400 pages, said the Minister of economy, Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had informed in writing on this date, that in the case of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt airport the State would again regulate the prohibition of night flights.
17 Flights between PM and 5 pm, admission as provided for in the federal Government, it would be compatible with mandatory legal protection of the population due to air traffic noise.
The coalition has to decide until January 4, whether to appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and lobbied the Government representatives to renunciasen to appeal before the Administrative Tribunal of the nation in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel group called the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises of prohibition of night air traffic, which had been made before the elections. Otherwise this could take as lack of Word.
It is very difficult if one leave you keep your Word, said the head of the Green Tarek al - Wazir, we are referring to the FDP slogan "we fulfilling our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel, the Federal Government would be trying to using the right misrepresentations recrimination and tricks still get their night flights.
Extensive legal research would need quite some time.
The coalition would not act on the basis of a "first quick impression".
We need a legally blameless decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As well as represented by the opposition, would not have been never claims its Group about the prohibition of night air traffic.
U.s. banks return borrowed aid.
Large u.s. banks crisis-struck abducted from their State seals.
"Bank of America" returned at once aid that had been given a total of 45 billion Tarp Bank rescue Fund (approximately 30 billion euros).
And also the Citi group plans to return State aid, according to the CNBC us.
This institutes are intended to break free of the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, as for example the limitation in the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as high fees.
"Bank of America" had approximately 19 billion cash on convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum was taken for the own case, which had quite a few media, among others by the sale of items.
Bank director Kenneth Lewis thanked the Wednesday night especially American taxpayers: financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The Bank House had calculated evil the effort of the absorption of the Bank investments at the climax of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also intends to money on the capital market to free itself from its obligations towards the State.
The CNBC reported known circles, the u.s. Bank could already announce source for this Thursday its capital increased by $ 20 billion.
A representative of the Citi group refused to comment.
In June had already returned their aid Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.
Quick choice
In the end everything was faster what thought.
Just two weeks after the Administrative Board of the ZDF (German television channel) presionase Chief Editor Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel may have a successor.
Yesterday at night the Guild was to vote for the candidate.
The favourite was Peter Frey, director of the Studio principaldel ZDF in Berlin.
There was a confirmation of this from the station officially not anticipate the procedure.
But surely also influenced the no harm more ZDF Markus Schächter, director if this proposal would not approve on the Administrative Board.
Frey, candidate Schächter needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Guild.
The result of the vote was not already specified at the end of writing of this edition.
Two Schächter weeks ago failed on the Administrative Board with its proposal to renew the Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against it. The dismissal of Brender was a bitter failure for Schächter, but a failure which could be expected.
That most of the Union on the Administrative Council already weeks before the election had indicated, would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition against the editor-in-Chief had been organized by the President of the Government of Hesse, Sr.Roland Koch.
Declined another term of the editor-in-Chief prestigious with the argument that bass Brender address the ZDF news would have lost ratings.
Until shortly before the elections, there were protests due to this, where the flageló political influence on the ZDF.
At the end up to be had taken in the debate 35 specialists in public law, rated as unconstitutional Koch proceed.
But not avail.
Of the person
Peter Frey was born August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
Studied politics, pedagogy and romance Philology.
He then worked in radio station "Südwestfunk" and the "Frankfurter Rundschau" newspaper.
In 1983 was changed to the ZDF in principle to the informative "heute-journal".
Following stations: 1988 until 1990 rapporteur editor-in-chief staff; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 director and host of the morning show "Morgenmagazins" until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The Green party announced a constitutional complaint after the dismissal of Brender, which was voted yet this Wednesday journalist of the year by means "Medium Magazin" magazine.
Koch instead on the Administrative Board, the President of the Government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week the Federal States should change the State Convention so that the director personnel proposals may not be blocked by a majority with politically motivated ZDF.
Supporters of the guilds of the ZDF control political retirement was discarded by Beck.
The likely successor to Brender, Mr. Peter Frey, recommended to the Administrative Board with a smart move: strongly criticized the Guild for the removal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence so Schächter could appoint it for the post of Chief Editor without losing face, as the Administrative Board could vote, without falling under suspicion to give as a supporter henchman.
The calculations of parties Frey is awarded however left Liberals.
The University runs clear
Partial success for students: a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of education and culture to Federated States ceded. At a meeting of the Ministers of education and culture with University Rectors, both sides had agreed to try to improve conditions of study in the case of Bachelor's and master's degree.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example had agreed to reduce the load tests: basically each module of the race to end with a test-only.
Also intends to review the workload of the students, and is to ensure a "real and justifiable measure".
Policy and universities want to simplify the recognition of tests between universities within and outside of Germany.
Federated States undertake to make the structural rules together for Bachelor and Master races more flexibly.
Regulations of the Federal States that diverge from this, must not already exist.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June the Ministers of education and culture and the rectors of the universities speak continuously improvement to make and successfully conclude a career (estudiabilidad).
Now for the first time spoke of a particular content.
The so called Accreditation Council agreed drastically reduce the number of exams: "each module ends with a review-only", said in a 30-page document which is intended to partially regulate the adoption of the University careers.
"Sensitive tests load reduction" intended to prevent the development in the wrong direction, which would significantly estudiabilidad, explained by the director of the Board of accreditation, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
Also in the future the "estudiabilidad" must be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
Modules and content must be thoroughly examined on unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of...
the courses.
Students would have "the right to obtain more spaces that facilitate and encourage the initiative".
These rules valdrían for new careers, but also in the examination of existing courses.
These will be "reacreditar" every five years. But this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races.
Those responsible for this would be the country 10 agencies accreditation that are under the supervision of the Board of accreditation, which is installed by the Länder.
Ministers of education and culture called the Federal States in October influence in the agencies, so that the amount of materials and exams are not too strict or too demanding.
In some States federated universities and technical schools already were in accordance with ministries to adopt such measures.
So far only North-Platinada assured provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money universities must implement mentoring and student counselling programmes as well as strengthening tests and foreign offices.
The State and universities claim to have 10 million euros for these purposes.
In 2010 the Government wants to take Parliament a novel of the University Act.
As it should be enough an only test for the completion of a model career.
The race settings should be made more flexible, also wants to ensure recognition of assessments in other universities and to provide accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year is to examine all the races of his "estudiabilidad".
This Thursday the Government and the opposition once again discussed conditions to study in the State.
There was also criticism of the decisions to praise part.
In the Board of Directors at the federal level, the University groups Juso (Socialist Youth) seexigía, education policy settings already should fail "behind closed doors" of the Ministers and the University Rectors.
At the latest after strikes of education, now as involved primary students should be able to say also.
The Chairman of the Board of University Rectors (HRK), Margret Wintermantel, gave his support to students: "We need the experience of the students," said Thursday in a meeting with the Ministers of education, with which the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
For the Trade Union of education and Science (GEW) Bonn agreements were entirely insufficient: the Union requires a legal right for every student with Bachelor's degree access to a later Master race.
Also the Federal States have to ensure, for the current generation of Bachelor students there on a future sufficient places of study to Master with the best possible study conditions. Reported by a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The Federated States have quecontratar many more teachers.
But of greater access to the master's, education ministers made comments.
More than a footnote in Herta Müller
"And out of Germany makes virtually no control" said the first line of a poem by the lyrical Werner Söllner desequilibrantes language fragments that tematiza the arrival in Germany experiences lived by a dissident, who won their freedom, but lost their language environment.
Werner Söllner, who was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked at first as a Professor of German and English in Bucharest, and then as reader in a publisher of books for children, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was given several literature, awards in 1993 provided the memorable lessons or poetry in the Goethe University Frankfurt talks and el2002 is director of the Forum of literature in Hesse in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Gave talk about quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich on "German literature in Romania" in the mirror and disfigured mirror of their service files
Visibly insecure and ashamed, Söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participation as IM in the Romanian secret service service to colleagues alemanes-rumanos, writers among other Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner received the German Prize for the language.
Recruitment efforts had begun slowly, beginning in 1971.
"I therefore am someone that didn't advocate sufficiently to attempts to challenge the Securitate fear", ended Söllner.
The lyrical Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time the granting of the Nobel Prize for literature Herta Müller and his literary controversy unparalleled with dictatorial domain mechanisms, shakes the literary scene and in particular community from German authors of Romania for a case that shows the depths and the evil of a political system based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is known so far, not only author but also victim.
Your record of service IM Walter had played a role, said the literary scientist Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner, and stressed the influence he positive delIM Walter.
It had been excused or defended at all difficult points for him, said Markel.
"I feel the moral need to make that claim," he said.
The Declaration of Söllner in this way and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of an ex-disidente and his work with the Romanian secret services, however, not surprising either.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for service-Spitzel spies gewesen, wrote Herta Müller already in the month of July in the weekly "Zeit", after having read his own record of 914 pages.
The involved will certainly speculated and have been known in some cases, which names were hiding behind of the IDs Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike the revision of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, dealing with the control by the Securitate records is still somewhat diffuse.
Systematic clarification was boycotted and complicated in recent years.
A National Council for the clarification of cases of the Securitate (CNSAS), Birthler, authority was formed in 1999, and the delivery of files since gives rather dredges.
Since 2005, there is no law which regulates the records management.
An interview after the award of the Nobel Prize for literature Herta Müller, evidence of the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, an ex-Chief of the Temesvar service spoke disparagingly of the condecorada.
"She has psychosis", in the end only interrogated once.
The infamy of power seemed to display without laps in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, questions inevitable case Söllner, as so often when there is silent blame.
Why right now? Who has caused damage? Calm reaction of the listeners to the confession of Söllner no longer expect that this story is governed more by the thirst for knowledge and not so much by the award of guilt and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature, is more than a simple footnote.
The Champions League as garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach soccer VfB Stuttgart, Christian Gross, accompanied by a provider on your computer, orange plastic bag addressed a Mercedes class c a quarter of hour after midnight taxi, gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed foreign service were coming out of a very nice celebration of Christmas, in which the sporting goods manufacturer had distributed samples.
The bald feature man had hired a driver, because it still did not know the city.
Furthermore, also had been able to lead the car himself: after all, there was alcohol in game, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow would begin work again.
Or it would start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who was hired just three days before: it is true that we reached the second round, i.e. in the Champions League thanks to the triumph 3: 1 against Romania, Unirea Nancy "but can we not blind for success: we must fight relegation brutally."
"Far more important task" expected them the following Sunday, said.
You will then need to repeat the success of "real classes" in the daily life of the League in Mainz.
And eliminating weaknesses that it have demonstrated clearly again, of the fast three goals from Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Draw
The second round of the Champions League (games of ida February 23/24 and 16/17/games round 9/10 and 16/17 March) sortearán 18 December in Nyon.
So joy remained limited by fulminant entry of the successor of Babbel.
Not only in the supposed Savior, in short time had inspired them flummoxed Stuttgart profis self-confidence, available to surrender and liked by the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their strengths, urged them be more launched souls Gross repairman explained their recipe for success sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel already not had taken effect.
He deployed a certain magic, accepted the supporter of Babbel, Jens Lehmann, "when football comes a new impetus, sometimes things happen that had not believed possible."
And Sami Khedira, that after a break of several weeks due to an injury progressed quickly to become the best local player through dynamic, attempted to describe the "phenomenon" received the proverbial "fresh wind" and how to work the new Chief: "He is a man who intervenes to background, and requires discipline."
"This is what we need in the current situation."
And this is what had been obviously while Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not passed yet testing, warns the sport Director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs above all record.
Like the Gross, also the players and the administrator abstained of overvaluing the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of relay and totally exceeded the Romanian guest.
Also had won in Glasgow, rather than four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 reached the sad wake up, gave think Khedira.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that if it had been a goal of the season, the other was still far away.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
Heldt had no desire to hold birthday number 40, even after the first victory at its headquarters for three months due to the events of the weekend, which returned to upgrade in the form of a television interview, transmitted just before the start of the game, which had granted the goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others and not Jens faced harsh criticism of Lehmann Heldt.
This had accused weakness in the direction of the Board of Directors decided to change coach by the pressure of teenage fans.
Also had removed his free day after games called him Lehmann as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann statements were "marked by pure selfishness" restored Heldt and announced the fullback implications.
Probably no longer be friends for ever, the two cuarentones.
But at least the spectacle of large game and battle force agreed on all others that, without the previous efforts with the replaced coach, team would not have been possible.
Babbel and assistants had "an important share of success", said Heldt and Lehmann together; and also agreed the man in the plastic bag.
The World Heavyweight Championship match
Ardent duel in Bern: and again Kevin Johnsonn Challenger was causing the world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after hard twelve rounds, Ukrainian defended his version of the WBC heavyweight title.
The opinion of the judges was unanimous.

38 Years in the version of the WBC Association champion won Friday to Saturday night in Bern to American Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision points (120: 108, 120: 108, 119: 109).

Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice associations WBO and WBC world champion.
Unfortunately, failed the knockout all had expected.
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 victories in 41 Professional fights, twice had to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th bout.
Before about 17000 spectators in Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 m, wanted to make the match with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven inches lower, which before the duel had proclaimed the end of the era Klitschko, was again avoiding champion, beats and Klitschko unable to fully instrumental to its target its dangerous right hand.
In general terms, passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
Although he was causing Klitschko with words and gestures, his only rare blows times reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second Boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in the year 2000, which held out twelve full rounds with Klitschko.

Supposedly, the company that promotes is already planning Klitschko fights in the London Wembley Stadium.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack the opposition: the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called liar to the Minister of defence, Gutenberg, due to false information on the subject of Kunduz.
The SPD and leftists require explanation to the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the latest revelations about the air attack of Kunduz, opposition has accused it the Minister of defence, Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU), having deceived informed.
The Saturday "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by TV ARD, the head of the Group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, said the Minister "knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoyes.
In one case as well, usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have regardless of the rules of the international protection squad for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report had NATO, and that you have read Mr Gutenberg said Trittin.
Friday had been made known that this attack not only was destroy abducted lorries, but also to intentionally kill two leading Taliban.
In the air attack in the United States, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO research report died or were injured up to 142 people.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called Saturday to the federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) speak immediately to the federal Parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a deliberate murder strategy is part of Afghanistan from the federal government policy, and if the Chancery, the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy, Renate Künast demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the green.
Government, Ulrich Wilhelm spokesman strongly rejected criticism.
The Chancery not exerted influence on the German military action in Afghanistan, said.
Saturday had also transcended the presentation made by the Ministry on the reasons for the dismissal of the inspector general Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Estado Secretary Peter Wichert doubts.
According to the SPIEGEL information, both had informed correct Gutenberg and completely against the background of the attack the convoys.
Officially told that they had been denied the existence of NATO reports and had hidden sensitive details to the Minister.
However, since the two senior officials environment transcended that they even had reported to the Ministry of defence the existence of several reports, including a document two pages of Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report of a patrol field.
Meanwhile, Wichert would have requested in a letter clarifying the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" newspaper.
To date has received no reply, it was said.
The Ministry not expressed Saturday at the accusations made you and noted that this would clarify in the Committee of inquiry of the Federal Parliament, which will be the next Wednesday.
Oníricos worlds
In a State of wakefulness, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and addicts fade boundaries between imagination and reality.
While occurring during sleep, everything is in order.
When we are lying in dark rooms with closed eyes, we can deliver us without hindrance to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, who experience the dream-like State during the Vigil, or see and hear things that others don't see or hear, is considered the most of the time in the Western world modern as crazy or drug addict, or at least as maniac.
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or the drugged.
The blame is imagination: the same neural processes which allow us to design houses, paint boxes or write novels, sometimes make desdibujen boundaries between sleep, madness and reality.
States of awareness alert modified oníricamente can appear in the most various forms, in the best call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although distinguishable triggers and effects, the visions of Hildegard von Bingen mysticism, psychedelic experiences of the Prophet of the new Era Carlos Castaneda, States of shamanic, possession and psychoses and hallucinations can be referred to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neural communication in the brain - especially the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - substances has descarrillado and is disturbed interaction between various parts of the same.
Complex hallucinations and enloquecidos thoughts often appear during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it
The relationship between insanity and dream has been to philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a State of wakefulness, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted a "great resemblance in the State of madness with oníricos States", in 1861 to Sigmund Freud, sleep even "a psychosis, with all the nonsense, geeky formations, and mirages of it".
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and scandalously colouring.
Gravity has no power over him, is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind figures of demons with wings, with red grimaces as blood, deformed, rechinando teeth.
You are pursuing, trample it with heavy and flaming boots, throw it against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Malignant and strident voices echo from the walls and the radio.
Already cannot support them, the voices you insult and offend.
Henning T. starts two stereo cables, secures them to form a Hangman knot and sets them on a hook on the roof.
Rises in a horn and put the knot around the neck.
Jumps.
The rope is loose.
What you serve lesson!, shouting voices in a chorus that crack you the eardrums, "see the clinic and beam that heal you!"
Now, Henning T. has 40 years and has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first for almost 20 years.
The cause which produced was the LSD.
Its diagnosis is psychosis esquizo-affective-paranoid is maniaco-depresivo, takes drugs, depression, mania, schizophrenia.
It has learned to live with his illness, three years is married.
In psychosis I experienced the most terrible anguish and deepest despair, said.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; psychiatric clinics is treated as the second most common disease of depression.
Acute schizophrenic psychosis, most often affected already cannot distinguish between inside and the outside world, and fall into a State of sobreexcitación which can lead to disorders in the relationship, or persecutoria mania, hallucinations, delusions of grandeur.
Especially extended is hear voices: voices that give orders, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The victim is unable to distinguish what is important in that it is not, the brain already cannot filter the disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded impressions.
As the dream also psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Heidelberg University hospital general psychiatry clinic.
The schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning to it.
At the same time enters a passive role, as in a dream, feels overwhelmed by events and cannot arrange them actively.
Therefore, that the schizophrenic feel often threatened, controlled and manipulated.
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them, the hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
On the contrary that in a dream, says Fuchs, "sensory and spatial structure of reality are perceived in psychosis remain in principle as is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations rely on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still unknown the why our brain does skip.
According to Fuchs, States of emergency can be anyone to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis.
But not all people develop psychosis.
Apparently there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but twins studies have shown that addition of genes also other determinants.
Researchers are those affected are suffering minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neural maturity of the brain is affected in an early stage of development, as for example of a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it is still a mystery how occurs that disruption of neuronal system, also not manifesting itself in any way for many years.
Also the influence of the environment plays an important role - stress or a traumatic experience can be a psychosis triggers when a previous provision already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as interfere in the transmitter system of the brain.
When the brain is heated
Illogical all this is psychotic people suffering with his hallucinations and make very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Professor in psychology Erich Kasten, Lübeck.
Receive a hallucination as pleasant or not dependent often point of view.
Kasten collects reports on visions and hallucinations for ten years and has analysed the results in the book Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf (unreal world in our heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical symptoms companions of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, many other diseases.
These include, along with psychic disorders such as borderline personality or depressions, often also conditions such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer and head injuries.
surprisingly, and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of memories that are usually repressed.
Arise when areas of the brain sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or are little cohibidas; when our brains are hot, but also when missing stimuli.
Drugs can cause this State in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, loves evil or other brain States of emergency.
In jüngeren Studien gab bis zu einem Drittel der Befragten an mindestens im Leben einmal eine Halluzination erlebt zu haben.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. He was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attended a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it wasn't for these images and voices.
Sometimes, for recreation, is a clumsy boy with long dark hair is pointing the word.
When she answers it, other students look soprendidos; no part of it, hears or sees the boy.
The shy girl is a somewhat strange ensoñadora, but Sarah k. knows that is not dreaming.
You are awake and sees, and hears that boy in the same way that sees and hears the girl sitting on the Bank of the side.
You can feel even its presence at least few moments.
It's a nice feeling, like the guy.
Sometimes asks if it is crazy.
Also know that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear.
At night, occurrences are alarming.
The visions are often a burden.
When is in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because the teacher - to his eyes and ears - is introducing a new partner while the rest explains in a visible and audible manner mathematical equations.
At night, occurrences are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room to get sleep, which often arrives late and there is little, can't distinguish if it is awake or dreaming, if the images he sees the grimacing or girl with arms and legs, bleeding cuts appear to her eyes open or closed.
Let me in peace, yells figures.
Parents and friends not them had nothing, believe that it is crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. It has hoy20 years.
Approved last year selectivity and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago that the hallucinations are missing.
Since it has entered into contact on the Internet with psychologist Kasten, knows that it is not crazy.
The madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when someone socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a time starts having hallucinations.
I believe that the brain is idle filer does it find entertainment.
Sarah k., only daughter and had little fear of children often played single.
His hallucinations began when thirteen years old, he learned man that called dad from has use of reason is not her biological father.
Since the acoustic and visual hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain also processed real impressions and noise to those affected as Sarah K. Find it them difficult to distinguish between vision and reality. "Each experience", says Kasten, occurs in the brain, reality projects there.
"Hallucinations are equally the brain produces images, therefore seem so real."
Kasten also classifies the night fantasies as a hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people not differ basically from an acute psychosis.
Unlike the schizophrenic, psychologically healthy people are able to recognize her as unrealistic visions.
Kasten therefore encourages patients appreciate his hallucinations as a special ability.
Situation between dream and hallucination
in this too focused on the conscious world, imaginary experiences are usually patologizarse, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor at Heidelberg and chief physician of clinical Psychiatry and psychotherapy hospital Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a hard and painful disease but also entails something positive and creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirismo, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as if it were a dream.
Dreamlike hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed to the person that you experience considered real dreams and that subsequently unable to differentiate be awake.
Oníricos conscious States arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, experiencing a motor to be fully conscious paralysis. vollem Bewusstsein bei die eine motorische Lähmung erleben.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by loss of oneself or the world with a motor disability total and permanent, it replaces a very dangerous real situation by himself and imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of situation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a reality, a change of world, although the real situation is still present in the imagination.
An intensively to sense and interpreting an unbearable situation itself our own creation ability allows us to not sink us in nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Also Peter Cornelius Claussen, Zürich, art historian describes her dreamlike experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as a soul rescue action.
It was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days travel after a heart valves with included heart transplant operation while his body was doomed to the immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen submerged in a world created by the same and visited strange places of yesteryear: was bedridden in bed, an old man on Board of a sanatorium on a train, a robot ensured their health.
He was in the high middle ages, surrounded by noble producing narcotics of blood.
A Greek on a bike kidnapped it in their country of origin, made surfing on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met with a Korean gangster.
It gives all these facts imaginaries, everything is real, even later in memories.
For Claussen, fundamentally different from any dream interioresson travels.
Dream is a different State, describes his experience.
On the contrary, mental travel memories are many years later, much lighter, even irrelevant details.
Clear and more intensive than real-life experiences.
The intensity of this experience diluted the horizon from the rest of our everyday experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, the oneirismo, psychoses, hallucinations and consumption of narcotic drugs show how fragile that is inside of external reality, playback even when we are awake.
Each change of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
A, on the other hand, can be completely enriching experience.

Will the children be Publisher with 27 years
The new Kallen editor has reached an interim solution: Hubert Burda wants to make your company in the future in the hands of his two sons, said SPIEGEL.
100% Of the holding company shall also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg - The Hubert Burda editor sees your company in the hands of his sons in the future.
Two sons become heirs with 27 years and have committed to enter the company confirmed Burda, aged 69, to SPIEGEL.
The details have been arranged as a precautionary measure.
The following that calls into question is if will participate actively in the company.
Also, if you are able to do so.
One cannot put front of 7,500 workers to their children if they are not sufficiently trained to do this.
That would end up with children and with the company.
Coarse unveiled on Thursday will withdraw from the Chair of the Board of Directors January and Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been named as his successor.
This member of the family Kallen, 52 has since 1999 Member of the Burda address.
Initially it was responsible for technology.
Later, he was in charge of the Treasury and thereby became responsible for the assets of the undertaking. After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also became responsible for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time any member of the family is the height of the Publisher.
Burda children have 19-17. His son Felix, now would have 42 years, died a few years ago.
Kallen designation is also used to "save the differences of 10, 15 years", according to Burda.
100% Of the holding company shall also be in the hands of the family.
With an eye on the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffle, Burda stated that family businesses are not safe from the decline: "This always has affected families who are infected by the desire of capital, which have misjudged search and thought that they could raise as well as the largest player."
That has never been my strategy.
I've never had "delusions of grandeur", says Burda.
Me I do not see as a preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and do not want to play with "Time" in the World League, these businesses have become too large.
The promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that serves only to look at the mail without even seeing certain types of attachments or browse by the network.
Enjoyed your five minutes of Fame in the United States when the time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
See for the street is more difficult, the truth, but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is priced very low and a monthly fee very low, less than half of what is paid, for example, the iPhone data plan.
Seen the success the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free service of data from for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
Monthly maintenance of about 12 euros a month, price includes the roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphones because you know what is having to renounce the data as it crosses the border or desperately seeking a cafeteria with WiFi (or FON connection) to consult the mail.
The idea of a roaming fixed price is incredibly attractive and some time would have to be up and running.
Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel arrangements, but in my experience needed a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print.
The repeated pulls his ears Commission for roaming rates affordable throughout Europe have just had a perceptible effect.
Outside the country of origin is fear using data, and rightly so.
To an aparatito as FonPeek (do not stop be curious bearing the name of FON when lacks WiFi) get this type of rates mean that operators begin to think differently and studying various proposals to amortize your data network.
Kindle is another good example, includes download books and other query traffic on the Internet.
No contracts and no bagpipes.
It is a connected device and pay for it to buy it, not every month.
And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, an option to purchase access for life as Peek already has in the u.s.
Not because you buy it.
I look at my email on your phone, thanks.
I hope so because I believe that it is a model more just for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle fetish color
Yellow is without a doubt, the preferred tone of the first American Lady.
If you already attended Barack Obama as U.S. President with a dress and a coat this color inauguration, chose the same to accompany him in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has led a very similar model on two occasions: Besides being a similar color - yellow-green with bright hues-, both times clothing consisted of three parts - clothing, jacket and sheltered from the same cloth-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at a first glance appeared the first lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had opted for repeat vestaurio.
But the fabric in which two costumes are made makes them very different.
If for the takeover of was a fat socket in Oslo is a velvet with engravings.
Add-ins have also varied: Green means heeled shoes once, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And the hair is also different: a reflected on this occasion, released the previous mane.
75% Of mothers had labour problems their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for the women of generations more young people wishing to become mothers.
Revealed by the study 'Fertility and labour career women in Spain', developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the women's Institute.
Survey of 9.737 women aged 15-75 leaves no doubt about: 75 per cent of mothers has been limited opportunities in the workplace due to maternity.
The study points out that there are many differences in the beginning of the coexistence in pairs and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work to develop.
Which do not have an activity outside of the home, working part-time, or have no stable work, before start living together in couple, bring forward the first maternity leave, and had more children.
On the contrary, women with stable, employment in the public sector, delayed coexistence and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
"Women between 35 and 49 years with fixed work are the first child of average, 3.7 years after starting the coexistence, numbers rising 4.1 women with fixed jobs have required more vital career time to achieve them, which has led to the postponement of the Union and the arrival of the children."
"In addition, job type has much influence on maternity less on the calendar of the pairing", explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado researcher.
The level of studies is another factor that differentiates the women age at marriage and to have the first stem.
According to the survey, the greater is the educational level, larger greater age to which marry and they have a son.
The difference is also maintained for the women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, having elementary and higher studies have been mothers for the first time the 25.1 and average 32.1 respectively.
"Laying down another division among women depending on their level of studies".
"While having elementary studies are married and have their first child from getting a stable job, of medium or higher levels invest this script and give priority to the achievement of a steady job as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a son", detailed Delgado.

Travel has its excitations and Vincent not saving shocks or highlights.
An exquisite pleasure, the book is a poignant invitation reads and re.
Here I leave some snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In their pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but almost physical, spiritual impulse, which I felt without name: pleasure against the tragic fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilistic, Christian allegorical, wrote that had the blood, rather than intellect between powerlessness and ignorance with a dazzling, poetic mood meaningless as the knife that he was about to kill him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by the woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, whose meat combined the thrill of adultery with remorse, a spiritual privilege which was to reach the sky on the road to perdition pleasure."
On James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach." "It's one of the eight thousand meters of world literature to scale the North wall from which again despeñan best climbers summits".
On William Faulkner: "It was a rare type."
Of itself, sometimes said to be heir to a county and other landowner who was the son of a black and a crocodile.
"Both dreams were greatness."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "this writer picked up the insane scream released from a bridge by that character of Munich to carry its ECHO to the bottom of the night of the 20th century in his literary form and made him on a journey from itself and by invoking the seed with a violent speech to worms."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day put on his knees and prayed: ' Dear God, I ask you to do to stop writing as a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave recorded these verses of Spenser: ' dream after the effort / after the port, storm / rest after the war, / after life very welcome death."
On Virginia Wolf: "In the luggage also brought their depression."

Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother a 70-year-old walked through our district in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed along her and our dog, a copy of mixed race, rescued the kennel and no more than six pounds of weight and without a Word, two kicks that left the malherido dog subjected you.
Our indignation is capitalized because we did not find the fun in a free aggression an animal small and defenseless, who by the way, was tied.
To this we must add the hot flashes that caused him to a lady who walked calmly and that when complained to these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energúmeno attacking an animal is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, with whatever weaker than himself.
The event occurred five any Tuesday afternoon for a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station we doubt that serves to much and to not generate sensitivities, only clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce it.
We do not understand that it is going on among young people to consider fun to beat a defenseless animals to us giving us love, company and friendship for free.
We do not know where they have been good education and respect for animals and people.
Michelin and Fesvial together by the helmet use
Manufacturer of Michelin tyres with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of the town, mainly among young motorists today reported both entities.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness of the importance of using the helmet, which is the only element of protection able to avoid injury to the head, or even death in case of an accident while riding on a motorcycle.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond design and manufacture products every day insurance" and stated that also contributes to this goal through educational and informative character actions.
This new campaign of the helmet use in the motorcycle, the slogan ' To be or not to be ', will be initially distributed posters in more than 500 motorcycles with the objective of achieving maximum dissemination workshops.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a tire manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop a more secure products.
Upload the sale of commercial light
Almost two years later, light commercial vehicles market beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
9.425 Units enrolled in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% in 2008 and, more important, leads the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the patron saint of Anfac manufacturers and sellers Ganvam.
The good thing, not osbtante, should be quarantined since the reference to the comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result is that, despite the resumption last month, registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% lower than last year.
From January sold 95.853 units with all vehicles that make up the commercial light tailor drawer: derived from passenger cars, pick up, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, have not gone away the clouds most affecting its demand, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are carried out by small and medium-sized companies that pay in almost 100% of the cases of external funding.
So restrictions is closed tap of bank loans must add other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or persistence of the poor economic situation.
Against this background, and unlike cars have served little aid for the purchase of the 2000E.
To qualify, individuals, the self-employed and SMEs to acquire a commercial light of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of no more than 160 grams per kilometre, CO2 emissions, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday from Ganvam returned to remember the need to devote special attention from the Government these vehicles and industrial (trucks and buses).
Sellers Association predicts a similar to the year you that calculates a drop in sales (passenger cars and 4WD) 19% by 2010.
Braking emergency aid is already mandatory
As was the case with the ABS brake anti-lock and will happen to the ESP stability control, assistance to the emergency braking systems should be a mandatory element in the European car.
In fact, already are in all passenger cars and light from newly registered commercial vehicles while for the other sets a deficiency period until the end of February 2011.
The measure imposed by the EU, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians while on his way to work, can also help avoid many collisions by scope.
The Assistant to the emergency braking is increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, the system detects the pisotón gives the driver.
But this does not always held this pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch car part of drivers involved in an accident had failed to set foot on the brake of the collision and half of them not took advantage of the entire workforce.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Intervention of aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum to the system of braking, reducing the distance used the car to stop.
According to a study of the EU itself, if all the cars were equipped with such elements, are preventable per year up to 1,100 fatalities are involved pedestrians.
The reduction will be still more - estimated that they avoid one in four claims with damage to people - when popularicen the so-called intelligent system of emergency braking.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (from a camera or a radar) detects obstacles and tells the driver to act slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reaction, helps you to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
I should not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device has the maximum effort to the brakes to minimize the damage.

The wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its last, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took Boxster S as a basis and made no less than 80 kg adelgazase which has left the scale in only 1,275 kilograms.

Finally, give up the audio CDR-30 system provided other six kilograms and changing the door handles with a cloth, the remaining kilo.
Although also offers dual-clutch PDK change, test performed on a drive with the six-speed manual gearbox mainly secondary roads in California, stretches of mountain with really revirados paths
Its behavior can only be qualified of blameless.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car do not step on the road with aplomb.
Rather, quite the contrary: long not testábamos a model so small and light that time, transmit as much security at the curve, even at high speeds.
It is a small athlete, able to heat their muscles in a short March long enough until ordenemos you esprinte, slow down, recover and return to squeeze its engine...
What you ask. Thanks to your address as communicative as required, which indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is that the car will.
And it will do it so with surgical precision.
The engine will sound
The sound of his Boxer shorts, V6 with 320 horses (rather than the Boxster S 10) is very successful and can enhance the 'sport' option and a system that modifies the engine already released earlier in the Panamera bellow.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either from stationary or recoveries.
Holds are strong, but not heavy or awkward.
The asphalt road that we are going through with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car well digirió bumps.
Electronic aid were mere presence in all the way; and that in some of the curves are ice to dawn and gravel, already well into the morning.
Ultimately, ultra-light, the most fun car driving that one can in the market and is more than a simple modification of the Boxster s.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, with a price of 70.831 €.

Thanks a lot
Days of wine and roses from last spring in which asset inflation has been the dominant tone in the markets of new uncertainty returns to reappear in the markets, which must not surprising since it is its natural state, in an environment in which officials make decisions about the uncertain future by nature.
Medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetize debt with direct purchase of assets, and indirectly by bar-free liquidity to near-zero types that financial institutions buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed direct purchases of assets have virtually completed, and without questioning its unorthodox policy of liquidity, begin to get some sand in the gears how did the ECB with your auction to year next week.
Investors doubt the ability of the world economy to keep economic recovery without as heterodox measures and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and corporate bonds differentials have returned to rebound, although still far removed from paranormal levels reached earlier in the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt returns to be affected.
Again, there is a flight to quality and USA, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an extension of the countries of the eurozone to Germany differentials.
Spain just had been affected by this episode of instability but that came standard
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not wrong to silence the moral hazard tried again to create awareness of the world have slowed the destructive effects of the restriction of credit on the loss of jobs, economic policy makers post defenders when what should be done is to impose a new Thanksgiving day.
However, about Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the Emirs to recompose the power in the Emirates and Greece it have already seen before.
A hidden deficit, elections, and a new Government to strip the blanket Government.
Prodi did in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
No sense the Ecofin salvase to Hungary a breach of their external payments at the beginning of the year and that will allow a member country of the euro does not fulfil its commitments.
What does have logic is the Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and do share responsibility to citizens of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public finances.
If how we look, we are faced with an episode of standardization of transitional, risk after some excesses in apalancadas positions, premiums would be than expected.
In the case of Spain, while our debt spreads to extend similar to European corporate bonds European not we must concern ourselves.
If European differentials decreases and we continue to expand, then it would be Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
About standard
Again, has all the look that will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish of time assets "driver friend prudence".
