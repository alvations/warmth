The Republican Party against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify its policy necessary to combat electoral fraud.
brennanovo centre, a scam called the myth that electoral fraud is less frequent than the number of people who die in the US after a lightning.
Republican lawyers, after all, for the last 10 years have seen only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the US.
One thing is certain: the new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of America's democratic system.
Unlike Canada have responsibility for the federal elections of individual states in the US.
and in this spirit, most American governments since 2009 has been the new laws, which make it difficult to process the elections or the electoral list.
This phenomenon has expansion after the elections in November 2010, during which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 States.
As a result, it was only 180 proposals submitted for 2011, the law limiting the right in 41 States.
new election laws require voters to submit a photo ID and proof of American state citizenship.
Moreover, these laws limit the period for elections in advance, zneplatňují right to be listed on the list of voters on the day of elections and odnímají electoral law citizens in its criminal record.
before the elections in 2006 did not require the electorate documents půkazu photo ID no US state.
The first state to introduce this request was Indiana.
constitutionality indianského law confirmed the US Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities spěchaly with the expansion of the procedure and to other States.
The proposals in the last two years have such laws in 34 States to force voters to give identity cards with photographs.
It should be noted that, unlike quebeku American citizens do not have universal identity card, such as health insurance card.
In fact, owns 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people aged to vote, no passport photo ID issued by the government by their state.
Furthermore, there is no such an identity card about five million new voters in 2012.
Moreover, the acquisition of the identity card is often more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect mainly young, minorities and people with low incomes.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income below $35 000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years so it does not have the required photo ID card.
And that is not all.
the students, who are known as voters in their turn to democratic candidates in several States are not entitled to use their identity card with the photos of their school.
On the other hand, the same States allow Members of hunting or fishing clubs who vote more Republican candidates, card issued these clubs used in the elections.
In 2004, require no state in election proof of citizenship.
The first such request by Arizona.
from 2011, about 12 States laws which sets out to show the voters that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly to limit the number of votes from the Hispanic community.
It should be noted that two of the three Hispanics prefer the Democratic Party.
Republican legislativci support laws in eight states that the minutes of the day of elections in 2011.
Moreover, the right of individuals and groups to provide aid to limit the voters who want to write.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during general elections in 2004 helped campaign for the minutes of the electorate to zaregistrování around 10 million people.
The measures taken in 2009 but has caused a decline in the process of adding new voters in 2010 to 17% compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers, in the other five states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period for elections in advance.
For example, during the general elections in 2008 in Florida were African-American, 33% of the electorate who voted for in advance, although afroamerických was only 13% of voters in that state.
for Hispanics, it was the same.
They were just 11% of all voters, but 24% of people who voted in advance.
On the other hand, whites who, 76% of all voters, only 46% of the electorate who voted for in advance.
against the pass laws that limit the registration of voters, of course, very strongly up the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters.
democratic governors blocked its veto several draft laws.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws even hit the Attorney General of the United States.
Some of them managed to limit the damage.
For example, laws requiring photo identification, only 16 of the 34 States.
The newly introduced rules, however, is undeniably difficult in 2012, the performance of the voting rights.
democratic critics talk mainly about bias approved laws and they are seen as the obvious attempt to influence the results of the elections in 2012 in key states.
The report brennanova centre of 2011 shows that states where these laws were passed, are 171 of the 270 electoral college votes necessary for victory in the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain already: this new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine some of America's democratic system.
The detection of prostate cancer: an investigation or not?
the dog to sometimes wrong results, which have been negative or even misimplemented positive, leading to unnecessary medical zákrokům.
All of this has increased the hesitancy of men, who are already reluctant to investigate at all to go.
to be investigated or not?
We have asked for the opinion of two experts.
in the studies carried out in the US has shown high levels of contamination between testovanými groups, so it is difficult to interpret these results and provide valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time the noted the different mortality among patients who are running the investigation, and those on them did not go.
The study also demonstrated after 12letém distance, that those who do not go to the investigation are about 30 to 40% higher risk of metastáz.
I recommend the investigation from 50 years of age or from 40 years, if your direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The men are also at greater risk of the African-American origin.
The key is to take the right decision when the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers, such species, which are inert.
Therefore, it is essential that the right to explain the patient's level of the dangers of his kind of cancer, it can offer alternatives neléčit necessarily prostate cancer, which has no impact on life in the long term, and focus more on active surveillance of the disease in these cases.
Today, many of the men, who was diagnosed with cancer cure, as their kind of cancer is not aggressive and threatens the life.
We will offer them more of the active supervision and in the case of progrese offering the treatment of the disease.
More and more often and with greater accuracy set out the criteria, which help in deciding which type of treated and which do not.
Yet so I recommend to the investigation.
It is important to interview with the doctor and the investigation to determine whether it is appropriate to take or not.
In cooperation with the international urologickou companies a movement movember tool that allows you to evaluate for and against in connection with vyšetřením dog.

disease prevention
Unfortunately, there is no magic procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, it seems the best way to reduce the risks of the principles of a healthy lifestyle.
It is estimated that if all healthy eating and sufficiently hýbali, up to 30% of cases of cancer could be prevented.
"If we all stop smoking, this figure rose to at least 50%," underscores the André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian society for cancer research.
By contrast, it is estimated that around 10% of cancer caused by inheritance.
Some percentage of also remains totally unexplained.
for the Canadian society for cancer research remains a priority for the fight against smoking, even though the number of smokers has fallen.
cigarettes worth 85% of cases of lung cancer.
They are also the risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
"even today is in quebeku 1.5 million smokers," kroutí head spokesman André Beaulieu.
encouraging figure: 10 years after kuřák stop smoking, the risk of cancer death falls by half.
weight
tělnatost and obesity are under SCC another risk factor for the disease.
increase the risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancers of the esophagus, slinivky and uterus.
"research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
nutrition
The organization also recommended to reduce the consumption of red meat.
In too high consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is appropriate to avoid uzenin, for that is the same.
The preservation of meat uzením, drying or solením can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"they can cause damage to the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
vitamins
In recent times, the various scientists focused on the link between vitamínovými accessories and cancer.
The research, however, have yet to produce a clear conclusions.
studies on vitamin E, according to SCC contradictory.
Although, according to one of them will reduce the risk of prostate cancer, Other studies talk more about the increase.
The effect of vitamin D for cancer is not clearly established.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on how important it is to talk about their concerns and precedentech from families with their doctor.
"to the investigation does not mean that you have cancer."
higgsův boson examined
The announcement of the likely discovery higgsova bosonu justified concern raised last summer.
There is a view that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And then there is the last particle, which predicts the existence of the standard model - our best or the "least bad" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - but that has not been empirically observed.
between physics, however, is not yet 100% certainty that higgsův boson.
doubts about the fact that we have a completely new particle, which is very similar to higgsovu bosonu as předpovězen standard model.
new data published this week during a physical Congress in Kyoto, but rather the lack of it, all the data in order to have an absolute certainty.
Suppose, however, that this is a higgsův boson, since the risk of error seems small, and look at what it is.
In this world is undeniably a law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise, ublížíte.
Although it is částicová physics very strange world, it also shows that it is a similar law: off exclusionary principle, under which the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "kvantovém status" - the "state of" roughly speaking, some of their properties.
further divided fyzikové particles in two categories.
On the one hand, we find an orderly citizens, or fermiony obediently follow off principle.
and at the other end of the range bosony, podlí anarchists, who are nothing at all - certainly not this principle, which means that may well be in the same place at the same time.
These bosony is further divided into two groups according to the equipment (by the way, absolutely wonderful), which is the particle adventure in Berkeley Labs: mesony unnoticed, which we leave here," and "power of particles, which is a natural forces and with which is higgsův boson probably somehow spřízněn.
It must be said, however, that these bosony are so exotická that, as it can be to believe.
If this article read, it is thanks to the bosonu with unusual banalitou: fotonu, or "particle of light," which is "a proponent of" electromagnetic forces.
When the particles with electric nábojem quicker or change its direction," Cancel "the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like oblázek thrown into a lake.
from this "intervention" will create electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.) and this wave of nothing more than fotonem - and thus one of the bosonů, "by force."
more stable field
It is also with higgsovým bosonem, with the only difference that "vyrušit" needs to be the other higgsovo field that this boson discovered.
This higgsovo field is much, much more stable than electromagnetic fields; to his excitaci is to be achieved very high energy values, as with the frozen pond levels already zčeří just a great rock.
For this reason, it is to be used as a huge urychlovač part as urychlovač in laboratory CERN - great hadronový urychlovač friendly ties is a circle with district 27 km! - in order to develop the energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field once again suited to clarify the relationship between higgsem and matter.
with the electromagnetic field do not, in fact, not all particles, all materials.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but not other - a piece of paper, for example, will never be from himself to ledničce.
and the same is true, that with higgsovým field do not all particles: those that do have a matter, while others (such as foton, let us look at it) do not.
and Mrs nováková asks what all of these studies are what "will bring us?"
From the point of view of science is a confirmation of the standard model (SM), which allows physicians to bend of any discrepancy between observation and forecasts SM.
Many physicists, literally wants to be able to find them, because the slightest difference could open space "new physics" and close some of the loopholes in the model.
It is to say that the model still has huge problems, there are no clarification of gravity (ouha!) or dark matter, which account for around 80% of space (again ouha!).
facilities but CERN has such contradictions there.
response
The response of the research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs novákových can find it difficult to predict, a mistake, however, would have to believe that there will be no.
hleďte: right at the beginning of the 1960s not průkopníci laser in low-level language features laboratories no revolution, will have their work.
assumed scientific use, but nothing more.
physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and he created the first permanent laser beam (the rays were pulzní) in 1962, I have already said - laser was initially regarded as a "toy to laborky."
Just imagine...
and, in addition, can the result of all the instruments that surround research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle a little light scanner in 1969 during their work aimed at optiku.
This scanner, although Boyle initially at all so neplánoval, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and made him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that activity around lhc are bound to change lives, but does that mean that you really never know...
palliative care - the best way to leave the life... | Le devoir
through its Commission for decent dying quebek recently involved in sensitive questions about the end of life.
The debate should continue in the near future, and at the same time, about the bill.
A lot of work remains to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le devoir tried to look at this issue in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago Mr L. has lived alone in his apartment in montérégie.
prostate cancer, which it stravovala, gave him a two-year delay.
"give me five years of life and it has been seven," says without emotion on his cot in the House for palliative care victor-gadbois in beloeil where arrived the previous day.
"But this is still the shock, you cannot prepare for this," adds.
The disease has done its work: a huge weakness makes it impossible for him to remove himself in the toilet or just eat alone.

"my greatest wish is to get rid of that of diarrhoea, the humiliated me," giving.
A few hours later, a team of doctors to cure his problem.
"in the life of one teaches that chlapi urine standing ovation," Pierre tells brodeur, psychologist in facilities victor-gadbois.
to return to the stage of the child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"depends on the ability of that man," whether it will return, says psychologist.
In the opinion of many people that deal with palliative care, the crucial moments taking place in the heart of the return.
Patients who nastupují in home with palliative care victor-gadbois, all are suffering from cancer.
their prognosis is up to three months of life.
At this stage the team of doctors and nurses who care for them, is not a so-called "medical" care.
In the case of Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fear "to die choking in full awareness."
The disease but enabled me to their children.
"I am worthy of children," adds.
"in life, I have no desire," he says, and then svolí to muzzle her respiratory device.
Yet still enjoy the last visit to son from Italy in the coming days.
in multi-residence victor-gadbois in cooperation with a group of volunteers providing body care with the help of nutrition.
This is palliative care, which is, if we cannot do anything else.
that death was more convenient.
In québeku marks one bed palliative care on 11 700 people.
This is very little, if we consider that all one umřeme.
There is life in optimal conditions, explains Dr. words martelová, one of lékařek in multi-residence.
Whether it is the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
When you die, you can, for example, to provide him swig Brandies or Pepsi, according to taste.
diabetici may not watch the sugar level.
and death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening were beer, Mr X, who died later in the night.
This morning dopije beer his son in honour of the late father.
"We are helping patients as well as their loved ones," tells Nathalie savardová, Director of care services.
in multi-residence victor-gadbois days go for each other, but they are nothing like most of each other.
In addition to třiadevadesátiletého man who rejoices in the last meeting with his family thoroughly vypodložený on polštářích while he připíjejí in his honor, die tragically šestatřicetiletý man surrounded by their parents, wife and two small children after us all options in order to survive.
"for half a year, there are always three to five beds, which are intended for people with cancer in 45 years," tells with concern doktorka words martelová.
53% of patients, who in the home victor-gadbois come here, from their homes, then 47% of hospitals.
problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% kanaďanů simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is designed to ease the suffering, when ill will come to the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or pečovatelském House.
and a number of organisations, such as the home victor-gadbois and society for domestic palliative treatment Grand Montréal specialize more or less exclusively on care by onkologickým patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in quebeku leads to many doctors specializujících on palliative care is the law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is in circulation manifesto signed by leaders in the field of palliative treatment, such as Dr balfour mount and Dr. Bernard lapointe, in which show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to doktorky words martelové is quebecký health system powerful enough to ensure all people access to quality palliative care, than it will be possible to agree with the implementation of euthanasia.
As he says, recently experienced pacientku, which spent 14 days in the emergency room in great pain without anyone has taken the necessary steps to her there.
fears that patients do not ask about the killing on the grounds that they are not getting appropriate care.
and at the same time that many onkologů takes care of their patients until the last moments of regardless of the dismal prognosis.
hopes for the survival of Hélène richardové were already quite minimal, when left difficult chemotherapy.
When I their onkoložce told that I am ending with treatment, responded that regrets that I'm no longer sure fight, tells us.
and, I said, that is the end of it.
There is no all-powerful care
doktorka martelová estimates that 90% of people who wish to die, thanks to its ošetřujícím doctors, for their wishes nevyplnili when they team palliative píče alleviate pain.
But it is important to say that palliative care is certainly not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to elsie monereauové, Director of palliative care in society for domestic palliative care Grand Montréal, 8% of patients from the treatment of pain.
at the very end of life often doctors use palliative tranquilizers that patient uspí until the moment of demise, whether nárazově or whether it is tranquilizers were permanently.
We cannot pretend that this part of the suffering we do not see.
the patient, which nezbavíme pain, will have more access to paliativním sedativům.
ill, which is not given the sedative, always say the same thing: 'I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to give me euthanasia," this means more of "I want you to think of the pain."
The implementation of the stories to grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute for health research.
extensive real estate scandals in quebeku
officials of the ways entrepreneurs in construction and public work, lobbyists political parties and experts on the Italian mafia still telling us what they know about the great "system," in which are construction, state officials, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia were landing.
This "industry" came quebecké taxpayers very costly, especially between 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting how the system crumbled since we have fundamental measures," says ironically Jacques duchesneau, quebecký Member and former head of the police in Montreal.
It erupted in 2011 scandal on the basis of the vigorous investigation aimed at the embezzlement of funds in connection with contracts for the construction of roads in quebeku, which the liberal quebecký Prime Minister Jean charest approved after long delays.
"duchesneauova report" confirmed the direct link between industry, murky financing parties and corruption of public officials.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," says, "Save only the Department of Transport on orders of $1 billion," when some people keep a tight rein on their instincts to get them to share!
charbonneauova Commission "has already led to at least two mayors," adds in the hope that it can be "rozkrýt lstivost some people."
The permanent unit to combat corruption based in 2011
The permanent unit to combat corruption based in 2011 is also involved in the fight, with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
Even police officers "marteauovy an array of" who, since 2009, to ensure that the Montreal "cartel penězovodů" significantly alleviate nafukování procurement...
In recent weeks, carried out a series of checks and obžalovali of fraud and corruption of local officials, such as frank zampino and Richard marcotte, the mayor of one of the suburbs.
The next on the list to be Gilles vaillancourt, who has just resigned from the office of the mayor of Laval, the third largest quebeckého city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly took the bribes in exchange for public contracts.
formal charges have also received transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony accurso and Lino zambito.
Lino zambito caused a sensation when the Commission explained the "system" of public procurement.
He paid over the years, 3% of the value of contracts, which in montréalu received prostředníkovi associated with the mafia, which then money převáděl the Union Montréal, for which the mayor ran gérald Tremblay.
zambito after 2000 was generous to all parties and to more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68 000 euro) provincial sides, especially Liberals, who have been in power at the time.
admitted to organize illegal hunting of finance for the former liberal vicepremiérku Nathalie normandeauovou.
contracts with penězovody, whose prices nadsazoval
in Montreal "corruption" system worked very well.
Gilles surprenant, former transport engineer, it before the Commission described in detail: in ten years have received gifts from construction companies, the invitation on trips, golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the hockey games and kapesné worth a total of $736 000 in exchange for contracts with penězovody, where nadsazoval price.
other public officials from the transport sector admitted that he had to pay for it, that a 30% to 40% of the nadhodnocovali invoices through false víceprací.
organizer starostovy by Martin Dumont then accused tremblaye that without embarrassment it eye to parallel budget that transport the dirty money into its coffers.
On the basis of these revelations Tremblay resigned in early November, which threw the Montréal in large-scale crisis.

70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation, which will finally be opened, says that "pulls the strings in order to understand how the system promořeného mravenci to stop gangrénu and načapalo culprits."
The process is painful, but according to her "positive."
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but it is to be set up in montréalu own investigative unit and the supervision to ensure that these dubious practices could not return.
as if cleaned.
regularly.
Jacques duchesneau himself says that "public officials odcizili hundreds of millions of dollars," but worries in particular tasks "Members informed on this cunning," If in these čachrů nenamočili!
It is estimated that 70% of campaign finance in québeku comes from dirty money, and with the ironic added: "I have heard that this is a weak brew of reality."
quebecká government proposes to limit donations to $100, but it will not resolve the situation: "as long as the strictly limited election spending, dirty money from politics will not disappear."
It proposes a comprehensive control of public procurement system and party funding: "which they cannot fall; focusing boldly on the things we can build again on more solid foundations and with greater control and respect for the law."
If this story očernil image quebeku and Montreal abroad duchesneau recommends all those who laugh at him, to look at their own it...
"psg is FC Barcelona!"
In this season's you with psg used a completely new rate.
As this development vysvětlujete?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals go to themselves, or entirely new dimension psg.
The big players have come to us.
Every day I am alongside them further.
The technical team helped me too much.
This fact allows me every day to raise the level of the game.
and in this it is easier.
In football everything is awfully quickly.
neztrácím but head.
Since my beginnings in přípravce in INF clairefontaine to switch to saint-etienne I always posouval the degrees.
You are using the competitive environment, which has introduced Carlo ancelotti...
The surge of this summer are accustomed to play games at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
and it follows that a player like me, then more power to match and wants to give maximum performance.
Moreover, me Carlo ancelotti gives much in the context of my position.
The hand has assistants, such as Claude makelele, who used to play the part in the same position as me.
and it has ancelotti decisive word at the right moment?
Of course.
ancelotti has the respect of all the engineers.
today has no 1 League, equal and are among the best European trainers.
It has huge experience and leading teams won a lot of titles.
He worked with excellent players.
I think the other titles in Paris.
I am a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I had a number of injuries.
The trust, which gives me, is another reason for my performance.
As you look at the first part of the season psg?
At first the League are Lyon, took the position.
But we remain in the Lee.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have come very easily into osmifinále.
What is your club goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we certainly want to be for the good of the European teams difficult rival.
We want to win the first of their qualification group before the port, so that we can play in response osmifinále at home.
Can the psg state in the short term a major European club?
The budget is already...
that Paris has become a major European club, must win titles and write in history.
This is not the case today.
On the financial side is psg means that the intention has managed to do.
and it would be a great failure nezvítězit in 1 League as in last year's season?
Of course, this would be a major disappointment.
This year, we want to win a lot of ligový title.
In last year's season has been missing once enough.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had an excellent season.
nasbírali we 79 points.
It is usually the case that you are clear with 79 points champion...
But other Club Montpellier season had even úžasnější.
I think this year it will lead.
Even if the title and efforts of the big teams, such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux, I think that we have the weapons to defeat them.
Do you think that the media from psg expect too?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us given what has invested here and what we have players.
We completely.
It is the fact that, when at home porazíme troyes 4:0 and yet still finds something that are in the newspapers vyčítají, so it is not very pleasant.
One asks what people can still want more from you.
This is not, of course, win 4:0 on every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to set the game style.
You need time to build a team.
in the Champions League, we have shown that we can play.
look at Manchester City, which has the second season neprobojoval to osmifinále, while also invested huge sums.
Given the investovaným amounts could be expected that you will be ahead of the other 15 points.
The urážíte other clubs and the French League.
clubs Lyon and Marseille, which failed in last year's season too, with the new psg moved to the next stage.
This shows how 1 League is amazing.
I hope that we can smile in May and say that, despite all the difficulties we have managed to win.
It seems as if psg in all relied on performance zlatana ibrahimoviče.
It is good that says that there is a "dependence on zlatanovi."
This means that ibrahimovič is very powerful and it gives a lot of goals.
due to come here and prove that it is the star of League 1.
Wherever it was, has demonstrated that he is a great player, the world star.
In our team we respect the person and player.
He respects the people, which has around them.
What has been achieved, it is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of the game.
thiago Silva, who is among the best defenders in the world, also allows other growth alongside each other.
As you prožíval Euro 2012 with the representatives of France?
As a disappointment.
I very much wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injuries I could not play as well as I would have been.
But I experienced it and I took from this stronger.
Today, I do play good matches in representation.
and in this I had hoped for since its arrival in representation.
We have learnt from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to be our exemplary behaviour.
How do you view the first month didiera deschampse in the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in Ms qualifications.
coach selects strictly, is close to the players and can bind for the victory.
This was also Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goal of the fact that we have qualified for the euro.
I hope that Didier deschamps leading our team to Brazil.
It draws (1:1) from 16 October in Spain a solid starting battle?
This struggle will add confidence.
We have all fought for the team.
Before the shock in Spain have seen such a match for their career.

about 1,000 Web sites already accepts bitcoiny as gifts or as a means of payment.
course bitcoinu first reached a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, today it is on the border of ten dollars (overview of courses is put on the page bitcoincharts.com).
In comparison with the world in exchange for real money or financial products is not an imposing.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) on this fact is in its report on the virtual finances, published in October.
bitcoin refers to as "the most successful virtual money," "competing" and "the dollar and the euro equivalent of normal money."
bitcoin differ from other kinds of virtual money that is used for the procedure as "credits" in the video game, which one gets a game or that you can buy (and sometimes even back to).
social network Facebook has also made a similar system.
Every month, but the central authority controls and processes the communication.
In the case of bitcoinu are all units network depozitáři current account books, supervisors, issuers of money and buyers and sellers.
As this network operates?
Every transaction between two users is, in fact, between the two electronic addresses by email.
The user can choose a different address for each payment, which provides anonymity.
a set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed with the system with the key.
The network can verify the legitimacy of transactions.
Thanks to the contents of the file is also possible to ensure that vyměněné bitcoiny existed in the public paper current accounts, which is distributed across the network.
The key point is this new transactions in the minutes to this book.
There is help solve mathematical task given computers, whose řešitel, a temporary central banker, will have the right dopsat this additional line.
This is the stage rozřezání file; that is, to the transformation of the huge file on shorter and unique digital footprint.
The "take" this new transaction and add to that number, then a whole "rozsekají."
The aim is to find a figure that provides specific mark (a lot of cipher's at the beginning).
Once this figure will find other units easily zkontrolují its accuracy.
transactions then nezničitelně display connected to a print of a chain of all other transactions; any regulations would have to change.
If the user would like to fraud to pay twice the same money very quickly for us (in 10 minutes), the network is only one of the two transactions - the second will be removed, because each of them has a different impression.
the computer, which will solve the challenge, wins 50 bitcoinů.
To avoid inflation, are the reward regularly two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoinů in circulation is limited by the number of 21 million, can be, however, is to share stomilióntinu, so there is room for margin...
The difficulty given the task of also increases with increasing levels of calculation.
The network has had its ups and downs.
The Web site for bitcoin provide services, have been attacked and have alienated stored bitcoinů.
"využitá crack is not the Protocol," assures Pierre noizat, who founded paymium, society for the payment of real money, which uses the network bitcoin.
The ECB also controls the money laundering opportunities with this anonymous service.
But this problem is true for cash.
major players, such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like platform Wordpress blogs is taking.
Adi Shamir and dorit Ron from weizmannova constitution in Israel recently analyzed the current accounts, and showed that almost 80% of bitcoinů neobíhá.
In November started "huge discounts."
"It was vyměněno thirty thousand dollars' rejoices Jon holmquist, who works for coinabul dealing with converting bitcoinů in gold.
Pierre noizat, who is also the author of educational books on this money, has a lot of confidence in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
his system, paytunia is equivalent credit card (with real money) or bezkontaktnímu paying mobilem, but uses the system bitcoin for verification of the transactions, which are cheaper as a result.
The also manages its identity and can remain anonymous.
The system is easily sets for traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
We need to address, which can be telephone "ofotografovat and identify," clarifies Pierre noizat, which assures that already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to question the hierarchical systems and transition to horizontálnějším systems.
"before bitcoin prevails, it will be a moment, but 2013 could be decisive," predicts.
The ECB's report also envisages the various risks, which are now considered to be increased if this kind of money will be successful.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
And what next?
The French troops leave their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (kapisa and surobi).
NATO and US forces should follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control over their territory and the Afghans to choose their own future and did not expect all of us.
The greatest damage suffered by people in the Afghan countryside, which we punish, as we saw them as terrorists.
and we also, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and what all those injuries and mutilated.
talibánci consist of foreign extremists, the former leaders, who fled to Pakistan, but often the venkovany, who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and an archaic tradition, although they added jihadis pakistánci, Arabs, uzbekové, tádžikové.

The departure of French troops from the nijrab, which I followed from vrcholků mountains posázených mandloněmi thanks to the French loans, took place in an orderly manner.
convoys of trucks and pancéřovaných vehicles arrive in Kabul without involving the air by helicopters.
Since the end of the 2014 already in Kabul will not be talibánci so active.
from their nezastavitelného procedure in 1994 and 1996, conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty at the time and the country was in the blood and fire as a result of the fighting between the various odbojovými groups.
They take control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for these obscurantism venkovanů that completely dominated the al-ká 'Ida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
former mudžáhedíni, the Afghan Government and the current talibánci agree in order to keep women in podřízeném position.

From what I have heard in campaigns, people long for the government, which will not be thieves.
Many young wants to go as they will leave those who manage to use American largesse: capital flight is considerable.
young already are tired of war and with it the ideology.
in exile in Iran or in Pakistan see the modern world and its benefits take it.
about 65% of the population is under 25 years old; 5 million people currently living in Kabul, one-fifth of the total population.
in state schools are full of cities, there are girls and boys.
These young people will have to work, they no longer want to return to the previous obscurantism parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, like mobile phones, television and Turkish series, which show the modern world, are everywhere.
The army is already present.
authorities will be challenging in its lead, considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight against the Soviet army already certain provincial militia, which are outside the control of central power.
Afghanistan, hornatá countries with a strong influence of local identity, following the example of Western states should should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, but the US wanted to transform it into a centralized state with a strong presidential influence, so the abolition of the post of prime minister, which has existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially not on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
his country, however, is from the 1950s and earlier years significantly dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has failed to restore, no dam does not work, no major irrigation system is not fixed.
Everything is; it does not produce anything, just fruit and vegetables.
preference is a private initiative.
In a country devastated by three decades of war would be necessary government control infrastructure.
roznesly rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
only fueling the feeling that Western states have been just to captured it.
Without the energy of iron ore and copper on the ground and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains but no mineral mining cannot take place.
The Chinese have been almost abandoned mine copper mes Aynak and left the international archaeological circle teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist complex, to preserve the role of a major employer in the province.
One day will also need to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is responsible for much of the import and export, restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new Treaty on cooperation assumes the continuation of normal types of aid: girls and chlapecká lycea, French departments at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.

The work, in which involved a number of local workers, helped to put down uprisings: irrigation wells, fresh water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and expansion of obdělávatelné area.
The memory of successive leave after two billion military spending?
much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions that are very difficult in these valleys, which are often at an altitude of over 2,000 m.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural aid from the local community in the province of kapisa.

The difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohammed mursí ventured into another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history because of the constitution, which it temporarily gives unlimited powers, decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday announced regardless of all the others, that the constituent assembly tomorrow to approve the final text.
Less than a week ago by the head of state this Assembly of a further two months to complete the work.
For almost two years used Egypt provisional text, which was very much filled in, which undermines the constitutional stability of the country and leads to the rumours.
This new initiative only further strengthen the division of the country.
From the point of view of the President of the opposition, in its "autocratic deliriu" to "violates its word" and "tramples on the right."
his supporters, however, assures that it is a means to quickly zatočit with constitutional and political crisis and speed up the transitional process.
a referendum should be held in two weeks.
It is a very short time slot, which the Brotherhood will withdraw from the text of the Egyptians to article by article.
It is also a way for the President to achieve national and democratic legitimacy, while protests have rocked the country.
As confirmed in an interview with us weekly magazine time, Muhammad mursí seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote for.
especially because this hastily organised the vote puts the people of Egypt before ultimatum: "either approve my text, or I leave unlimited powers," which would otherwise should end after the adoption of a new constitution.
And in this particular air yesterday 85 Members of this constitutional assembly approved the text with a large majority of the Islamists.
most liberals was missing in the vote.
In the middle of November, not long before the Constitution bouchli doors with the fact that they do not have the opportunity to promote their views.
human rights advocates, civil society or members of religious minorities their step napodobili.
In order to achieve a quorum was yesterday morning hastily added 11 people from the náhradníků.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No surprise, then, that the articles of the constitution were often voted in unanimously.
commentators also suspended over the fact that one of the few disputes that day točil around... hours for prayer, when some members of the committee were of the view that hours in the meeting rooms are not properly seřízeny.
The text, which was voted on yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
The general subject, Article 2, remains consistent with the version of the 1971 constitution, and states that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
the Salafi parties, which is one of the fundamental requirements of the introduction of Islamic law, hoped that the "deadline" will replace the term 'rules', which would allow stricter application.
for Islamists, the fact that this article has been corrected, a sign of their good will and respect for the other component parts of Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," argue the Liberals, who see it as just a figure of speech.
According to them the Islamisation of the constitution is through other articles.
focusing mainly on Article 220, giving the university al-azhar advisory role, especially for the control of compliance with Sharia law.
According to the professionals to Egypt Sophie pommierové is worrying, because "people povolané to express are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this in the beginnings of the theocracy."
further fueling concerns of liberals, the fact that the university's next president should be less moderate than the current one.
"so far, it has no specific religious consequence.
with this constitution Egypt remains aware of the framework of a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, not ulamové, but University workers, many of whom she majored in French schools," tempered by concerns Alexis blouet, which is the work of a constitutional transition in Egypt.
agree, however, that "there can be differences about the interpretation of Article 220, because it used dates is part of the vocabulary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science pozn. red.].
and in the future, it may be the question of the extent to which they are competent civil judges to be able to express."
Yesterday the agreed text is in addition to the religious site very criticised because of the expanded powers that the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there has been a significant reduction compared with the old regime.
Another controversial place: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army will verify the defence budget to Parliament, but the national defence Council.
Then they will not be banned management with civilians in military courts, requested by the Association for the protection of human rights.
The association is in the context of the text, which is directed by them against freedom of their doubts.
the crime of blasphemy is maintained and an insult to remains banned, which could have serious implications for freedom of expression, especially for newspapers.
No rule, not about protecting women, highlights the heba morayefová from Human Rights Watch.
as it is the only positive item mentioned in Article 36 of the ban on torture.
The word was not mentioned in the Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had yesterday evening to speak in a televised speech, rallies are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the heads of state will demonstrate on Saturday.

"the great and powerful" in Moscow: emigrants to save money on language
While members and human rights activists still debating the mandatory language law studies in the country have discovered fraudsters selling "counterfeit" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities every year, 13 million foreign workers.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, turkménie.
their sole aim is to earn enough money to support families at home.
The law came into force on 1 December, under which everyone will be working migrant obliged to test of knowledge of the Russian language.
Yet this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services sector, the housing stock and domestic economy, lifestyle and retail sales.
FMS promises, however, that time will be the appropriate tests mandatory for all visitors.
But the tests will be composed not only of linguistic knowledge, but also from the Russian history and of the foundations of the law.
will also be the door to gain knowledge of the language and the extension of the work permit.
The exemption applies only to the citizens of the countries where the official language is Russian.
This law is not even people who have successfully achieved atestace and get academic degree to the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
benefits, condemnation and the protection of the rights
network pilot jobs will work under the auspices of the puškinova Institute of the Russian language, University of friendship between nations, Moscow State University, the State University in St. St Petersburg and other Russian high schools.
migrants can consist of tests in all cities; it is open in Russia more than 160 such centres.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing support and members of the State Duma and the federal migration service (FMS).
But before the law came into force, the defenders of human rights could very much to ask a question in the press: and what it actually bring?
What will change to know the language for the Russians and the visitors?
and above all, to the migration services, to reduce the number of people who are suffering as a result of "slave labour."
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Board President FMS Russia in Tajikistan Viktor sebelev.
The protection of their rights should be launched before their departure.
the only system organised the recruitment of foreign workers to solve the problems of 90%.
The problems arise with immigrants without jobs, without education, who do not know the language and have medical assessment.
without the knowledge of the language - says with conviction sebelev - is the future migrant sentenced to the terrible conflicts with people who will help him under the pretext of "voucher" irregular, close hostels in which will he and dozens of others, such as himself, but for months without food and documents and work their fingers for a period of 12 to 14 hours a day.
Many of the complaints we receive from our migrant workers.
"in their home country they promise one, but after the arrival of podvedou, zabaví them passports, nevyplácejí promised wages," confirms the main of the labour migration management Ms tolib\ xC5 aripov.
nenadávejte!
The less that many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who intend to go to work in Russia, recognise that not only do not know the language of the country in which they want to, but do not have the experience or even with the work.
Of course, it is not their fault, as a disaster: very little, Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least adequate basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed the children, not to mention the fact that they need to be fairly obléci, obout and equip to school.
as children are in productive age, must receive the work at the first opportunity.
without the knowledge of the language is difficult to admit.
"you feel the humiliation and méněcenní."
It is true that, in view of the law on the language tests show human rights defenders to one important thing.
testing will be implemented only those migrants who have legal status.
If they have not, and will not have to pass exams or get no further official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers live as before in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the arriving workers claim that to get official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - the bureaucratic obstacles and all those linguistic difficulties.
The legalization in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
the Russian police employees know that we are in fact false documents, without registration, and there are cases of blackmail.
"require a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists on their experience of the Tajikistan citizen umed chuškadamov.
"come on, do lakomý buy malbu"
On the first day of the language law found that false are not only evidence of migrants to register.
FMS staff have seized several false certificates of passing the language tests.
falsified documents are printed on ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not free: each of the migrants in the hope that it will facilitate the problem with absolvováním tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times higher than the amount from the official test: the three thousand rubles will become migrant workers.
The main task of the near future is to ensure the system from the corruption that workers cannot simply buy the papers, government officials and human rights activists agree on that.
government authorities may yet promise foreign workers who failed tests they needed time to have completed the course the foundations of the Russian language.
for the visitors, who do not understand Russian, is working in the areas in which does not require active negotiations with the people.
MVD (the Interior Ministry) fails to the circulation of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
MVD Russia is made of a tightening of the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the response of government authorities to recent events: stimulus cases were firing on weddings, which bypass without victims, and the massacre in a Moscow lawyer dimitrijem vinogradovem, as a result of which killed seven people.
police wants to ban the wearing of dangerous weapons in public places and to increase the age at which we can obtain a licence to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and the fight against corruption Irina jarovaja, which has promised to change the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian state authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
In an open letter to the network appeared, which the authors - representatives of the various social střeleckých organisations - are demanding a "stupid" tightening of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily lesnikov, a lawyer and kriminalista in an interview with the Russian heard the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior was 142 crimes are committed in six months of 2012 from the use of firearms, registered the institutions of the Ministry of the Interior, while for the same period was committed a total of 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter they believe tightening legislation on civilian weapons cause the perpetrators, to move to "black" market.
In their words can currently find any weapon in Moscow for a low price.
At present the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation is under control with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
suppliers: from plants after officers
"black" arms market is supplied everyday several channels.
The main channels is five, says a retired Colonel Victor baraněc, who worked for 10 years in the workplace of the Ministry of Education and general staff.
a screenshot of sites that receive orders weapons
The first of them - the "army or military way," this means the weapon, which was odcizena during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Russian officers stole the weapons and the kavkazané," says baraněc.
Another type of "black" weapons are weapons stolen by criminals in the security forces.
baranec explains that this includes theft of police stores of weapons stolen directly from the staff of working in criminal proceedings.
illegal "mainly" coming into the sale of military stores.
In many military warehouses often there are outbreaks.
"There is evidence that some of the fires have been set deliberately - to cover the Manka," says former soldier.
bring their contribution in the words barance arms manufacturers.
"at the moment there are private firearms businesses, which are not competitive on the international market, and vyřazují weapons, which are on the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of "black market" is smuggling.
a particularly large number of gun and machines come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes there are weapons produced in malovýrobě, a mafia, which organised their steady production," explains former soldier.
Where is the weapon?
experts sečetli, what is the rough of the supply sources of illegal weapons to "black" market.
The report on this issue processes in 2011 analysis of the problems and the centre of public administration.
specialists examine reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Russia's statistical office, kriminologickou literature and data public data portals aimed at tematiku weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers say, comes from the military and executive authorities.
Half of all weapons is on the black market "due to officials, whose work is associated with weapons," says the report.
According to data available to researchers, 17% of weapons from armed conflict comes in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archeology."
prodavač-konzultant one of the arms trade, who asked us to never mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in vykopávkách black "archaeologists" long ago no one is buying - are simply too old.
Most often, he says, sellers are for new shipments directly in military stores.
Despite praporčíka bidders buying unit, for example, pistoli TT.

"It will take away into the city and there it sold for 900 Euros a head with two reservoirs," tells.
"The truth is that the police are well in the picture, and that is why, whenever they will burn plan in the detection rate for offences, making the purchase for control of illegal weapons," adds adviser.
"as in the luxury trade '
sellers with buyers most often find each other despite its known.

sellers in the market are, but there is also a need to go hypoteticky "from Mr Ivan ivanoviče, who asked me to pass on that dcerce get a tooth."
and now I get there despite man, which I am sure.
He is also only give me, because it knows that I neudám.
beginners looking for weapons in different ways.
former soldier Viktor baraněc tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when drew up paper for publication on this subject.
schemes has not changed in his words.
He made the album with photographs, where it was "everything that you have pomysleli."
"I feel as though I am in the luxury store," recalls soldier.
The buyer, in the words of baraněce, do not offer zajíce in the bag - everything you can try.
I, the potential client, simply nekupuji - we are going into the forest with the buyer and to set a target.
"give me the opportunity to shoot, and when the přesvědčím that weapon shoots well, we act," describes how expert.
The system on a sofa
The search engine on the Internet, you will put on the web site of the "vkontaktu," where "offers to buy the weapons for different purposes."
That does not need any documents or personal meetings.
"We have a set amount of money," write the headline in advertising on the web site "to buy the combat pistoli or slot machine."
On these pages users leave their announcement and ask questions.
and the sale of minors?
"of course, without a license," is now asking the user "Ivan" (spelling) is preserved.
"I buy tt.moskva" - in his request "fedorenkov."

According to the official statistics office, compared with the period January - October 2011 the number of these crimes in Russia by 7%, and was 22,9 thousands of cases, and the number of objasněných cases of theft and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices are down 7.8%.
The workers have been on strike in the US fastfoodů and supermarkets
work on the Treasury locations "McDonald's" through to a quarter of all American teenagers
In America in recent days there has been a wave of protests against low wages in hypermarkets society Walmart in restaurants and popular fast food chains such as McDonald's," "Burger King," "taco bell," "Wendy's" and "Kentucky fried chicken."
So far, no one can predict whether this wave of transformed into a ninth, or whether it is destined to disappear soon.
This whole share support trade unions and many left-wing social organisations.
In addition to the modest everywhere salaries, which are ordinary workers in walmartu and in the systems of fast food, is the aim of the organizers of the protests to create in them in their trade unions.
At the moment this economic sector is virtually intact odborářským movement.
46 cents per year?
The action began last week after a díkůvzdání, in the so-called "black Friday," when America hit orgy of cheap fire sales, a million people and, in some cases, is accompanied by a rvačkami.
On this day, some workers society Walmart, in which around the world working on 2.2 million people have left their workplace and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists multinationals chains whose goods is for the people of the lower and middle classes.
WalMart sold all around the world, from diapers to hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
That is why many low-wage workers in stores Walmart buys only for themselves at work.
The availability and range of goods made from the chain Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
In the words of critics can Walmart to sell goods cheaply partly because few pay their staff.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as a lack of automatic wheelchairs or small scanners.
The demonstrators on "black Friday," called for an increase in salaries and they complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the companies have risen sharply from 30 to $100 per month.
A typical worker WalMart receives $9.5 per hour, but it is not in the level of spending, say employees.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley has shown that if Walmart will increase the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
This is an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on the salaries now.
If the company WalMart shifts wage increases fully on the shoulders of consumers, will each visit to the state by only 46 cents more.
for the year as customers spend about 12,39 dollars more than today.
Defenders of society WalMart point out that the protest took place only in nine countries and companies should not cause virtually no damage.
"black Friday" in stores the company insisted on Thursday from 8 o'clock in the evening until midnight The next day, and during that time the company WalMart sell about 5,000 items of goods per second.
Overall, the Treasury made in the "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
company representative Dan fogelman said in an interview with the left-leaning aimed website huffington post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees walmartu, and that the protest was full of "other media sensation," organised by the trade unions.
"vacant Treasury!"
protests continued this week in New York, where their aim not trade houses Walmart (those in the pokrokovém city are not very popular, and that is why we are almost), but the "McDonald's" and other types of restaurant.
McDonald's says that sells billions of, and then you or not with sick leave and not you properly for your serious work.
jumaane Williams, a member of the city council in New York
Currently, the minimum wage for the work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York 7,25 dollars per hour.
fastfoodové restaurant this pay rise gradually, but only slightly, and on average, their ordinary workers in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
In this drahém city no one has lower wages.
Well I do not understand how you can be in New York for that money.
employment in the "McDonald's" through almost a quarter of American teenagers who work for standing there after school part-time and live with their parents.
Few people see in that its main source of livelihood or plans to remain there for a long time.
At the moment, they constantly in an interview with the workers "McDonald's" who complain that the money must live and sometimes even to feed their children from them.
On the other hand, hangs on the Wall Street Journal forum comment, which the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how you feed them.
The protests, which began at 6:30 in the morning on Thursday for "mcdonalda" 40th street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cash register and all businesses fast food began to receive at least $15 per hour, which is more than twice the minimum wage.
also called for trade unions to be based in the realm of fast food.
American laws forbid the administration to defend the establishment of trade unions and to punish the activists of the trade union movement bullying and redundancies.
from the other side of them, rarely making life.
introduce businesses fast food trade unions, however, is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is extremely high employee turnover.
opposition
On this day, noisy protests were held in many other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was at the Assembly in "mcdonalda" near Times Square, where there were few local democratic politicians, particularly member of the city council jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's" says that sells billions of, and then you or not with sick leave and not you properly for your serious work. "
The demonstrators have seen the support of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor of the town of bill de blasio, who said that "we must come together to support workers fastfoodů so as to achieve fair compensation for their work and economic prosperity they deserve every New Yorker."
as described by the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of America's sphere of fast food.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though far from all of them were employees of fast food in New York, which employ tens of thousands of people.
Whether this event will be the spark that zažehne fire mass movement, is still unclear.
"so far are brain mislead on average"
The reality is a popular topic among fans of the modern technology of virtual reality; it means seeing the world in recent times, particularly through the prism of special glasses.
In the early years at its annual conference showed Google working model of this news and in November, it was announced that the patent application by Microsoft.
from an interview with a group of interactive 3D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft\ xC5 aramem izadim shows that the glasses for this company scientists are already a thing of the past.
attracts is the prospect of manipulation with virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
Please tell us aware of the framework of the deals with your research group?
We are dealing with interakcemi man machine, but at the same time, we are trying to move beyond this interaction.
humanity has yet at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, most sometimes affects screen finger.
We want vyhlížet in 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, konzola Xbox and sensors kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without scanning kinect, because for all the management is very interesting gestural.
- what is still ahead of us in the future?
- despite the fact that the system kinect extended interaction on the physical level, there is still a lot of interaction on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The flow of information to improve the system, greater amounts of data, but the flow has not particularly.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really trojrozměrných display systems based on the various technologies including projektivních.
It is important to allow computer world in our physical world, do it more real.
To this end, however, it is necessary to know not only the user but also the room around him.
Then we will be able to add to the real world, the virtual objects in much better form.
and in the first place - to hell with those silly helmami virtual reality!
- What do you think about hlasovém control?
This is a popular thing, but nepřeceňuje?
- surely it cannot be seen as a panacea - raises the issue of privacy, not because we always want to inform others in our neighborhood about their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, we had a project for the control equipment in public places in which we think about gesture politics, but not on rozmáchlých only on such skoupých, short.
gestures while nesnímala camera equipment, but náramkem, to monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it is great, but in theory it can reduce the size of náramkových watches.
In general, however, that the future is a mixed type of control, for example, a + voice.
- and how?
How, I ask, for example, to give you this can limonády?
You tell it and at the same time ukážete.
- I usually just simply talking.
- oh, that will be very difficult to identify.
So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot at the moment?
- it is not necessary, but it is the convergence.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more precisely to the man.
It may be, for example, laser sensors that provide a good depth of distinction, that is very important.
- If you have to talk about their work with sensors Xbox kinect, what are your demands on modern cameras?
Today is not sufficient distinction, the depth or something else?
- in fact, the current generation - that is, from what we can be reflected in our work on three-dimensional detection.
Of course, it would be good to speed of 1000 F/8 megapixels.
But it is not just about the megapixely, but as a nut and depth.
While the views of all current technologies are inadequate for us - přidělává work designérům algorithms.
So we need to bear in mind not only the distinction in the X and y axes, but also Z.
So, the speed is very important, the number of frames per second.
human movement is a dynamic and current data flows 30 frames per second, frankly, are a bit of a little, especially for gestures.
Stephen betishes of our laboratory in redmondu did dotykový scanner with nastavitelným processing delays of 1 to 100 Ms, and the current sériově produced sensors are closer to the other ($60-100 Ms).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, the work would be very useful equivalent of such facilities, but I do not need so much dotyků, but I need some extra images per second.
- and increasing the number of cameras is not necessary?
- in the system kinect are now used three "cameras," one of which is in fact range transmitter and the second person - odraženého signal.
and a third camera - that is, in fact, a scanner visible range.
It is used to determine the depth of the object.
more cameras could potentially solve the problem...
or worsen it, because it increased the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create flexible analog system kinect, pohrát the zakřivením Hochzeitslocation cameras and see how it will help in determining the 3D location.
If I recall correctly, Microsoft (unlike Google) has not presented publicly their glasses.
Do you not think that, when it comes to the daily use of technology the reality with special glasses, this is one of the nejslibnějších platforms?
Of course - to keep the hold smatphone in zdvižených hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the strongest option would be "transferable" form of reality, when it would be possible on the basis of the platform clouds switch at any time of the glasses on the smartphone, screen display, and round and round.
glasses - this is a very personal equipment, that is their strength (private things you can see only you), and, at the same time, the weakness - the reality on the basis of the glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual buildings at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holografickými objects in the air is available not only Tony starkovi in "iron man," but also normal smrtelníkovi.
There is one issue on which critics often point: there is no dotyková response.
hand feels nothing!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- in their přednáškách often say that the reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the tactile vjemů could well become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, the use of one of the interesting tricks - using the other hand as a kind of paper for display.
in an excellent manner, drive down!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding hmatatelnosti these "lines in the air" - for example, the country several směrových ultrasonic X-rays ranging in defined point, where the finger is a tactile feel, but it is still very weak - as if you foukal on bříška fingerprints.
There is also a wrist strap on the wrist, which affects nerve conclusion in the fingers - also promising direction.
- have you tried to deceive the brain?
to think that feel what appears to be that he should feel at the moment when they see something?
- it is a good idea, we have not yet nezkoušeli.
Here is another challenge that will fight for a long time - how to make a man who is physically located in very stísněném area, to believe that is open, virtually endless space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not in clubs such as), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If the deception of the brain becomes, it is still work for many years.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in the very beginning.
vkusovština instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
"rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "his avantgarda," dedicated to the citizens, who are at the forefront of avantgardou culture and art.
at the top of the list have already been significant characters art beyond the city of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are often achieved recognition in Europe without všeruského věhlasu.
The new hero "rosbaltu" is striking a designer Cyril Miller.
the whole town knows cyrila millera - vousatého men, which is the whole oblečen in red, which potkáváte here at the Russian Museum in the summer garden, here in the fashionable hospůdkách and vernisážích.
images cyrila millera wherever they are exposed to, always attract crowds of spectators.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical petrohradských vypravěčů, creators of new mytologií.
Cyril Miller stands a St. Petersburg avantgardy the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, the city man, his visual aspect of the mood on the streets of a smile on the face of it all.
recently took up flašinet and become the Petersburg residence flašinetářem, because in this difficult role the his whole bohémským life, philosophy and image.
- cyrile why so chodíš after the city in April and not in the West or, for example, in tyrkysovém?
I chose the red colour as a designer on the light and image.
In this world is a red color compromise between the artist, imagemakerem and the public.
Although it is generally true that everything is just a little different from the grey, cast the aggression and a bad characteristics.
But my provocations are aimed at that began with an interview.
the whole history of my provocative acts is, above all, an invitation to the debate.
- and when you understand that you must be an artist?
The exhibition - in the House of culture to něvském, where they were exposed to my work.
I understand what is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists and the new, free types of artists I could understand.
On several occasions I have with a new wave of artists, with post-gazoněvskými who brought us to the "puškinské 10" and other waves were not.
attracts me to theater, dress, music, in all genres in addition to words.
- all sloučilo in your art-klinice... - for me it was important to be in the centre of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best should gather force of creativity.
In 1995 I occupied place on puškinské 10, and there before reconstruction there was hudebně-umělecký Club bohémský club, home petěrburkské bohémy.
There was much: nom Tequila jazz, don't forget, as\ xC5 nura brought with the "ear van Gogh."
\ xC5 only and his friends sang under překližkou easy songs, oblékali into přiléhavých trikotů, between the two composer Igor vdovin, which is now in fashion.
When the band began to play live, has become "leningradem."

where the left our workers and permanent guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000 was a survey was in the press, the special price was "the people in our city."
"the artist of the Year" in the nomination I was appointed, it ended my top.
In the new times under the old rules work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the current, it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity of today are different things, you can be popular, but not too much cultural.
- your work is characterised by a rozpoznatelným way.
Many of my paintings are hits, in which it is vividly depicted the relevance and pronikavost.
I have an exhibition programming "Russian Museum in klaunech."
clowns are timeless categories.
Before I had to be social, today this is painful and horrible.
But in klaunech everything close takes tragika.
I love grotesku, I get grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world by totalitarian guise in nařizovacím order.
Today people face in the clothes of their ability to external drive, not internal man.
Or perhaps it is not reaching out and he is to be plivnout in the face.
and the error will be removed převlékáním.
Recently, we have seen you in the role of the urban flašinetáře.- cultural city should have such a hero.
and who it should be, if not I?
Komerční art - and can be beautiful?
- at the moment should be commercial, utility, a discreet, sweet.
There are the cultures.
before people arrived in hloučcích, bohéma loved one, simple other people.
Today, all rozbilo on mikrospolečnosti, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I am not stodolarová banknote, all to be liked.
Today we need to think, to whom zalíbíte.
Today, every cultural hero of 100 fans.
- and on stasu michajlova comes several thousand spectators.
- it will fanynky there involved sexually social sphere.
and the cultural ground comes 300 people and 10,000 of them come, and the result is less management, money, everything shrivel.
I have fans, it is essential that no one is neoklame and neporuší, as is the usual.
when I was young, I directives such images, on one of the vintage visely on the wall together with falkem and larionovem.
I started with images, which most people end up.
Today, people often confuse the concepts.
They say: the culture of the consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, this is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing images.
and I am for a culture.
- cyrile, what is in the lack of Petersburg?
- good experts on culture.
There is such a concept: leader myself through culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
at the sound of this has not been the case in all of the Tsars, perhaps too did not understand the culture, but understand that it is necessary to support the real experts.
In Moscow today are good consultants.
In the US we have people in St Petersburg, who could be the experts, but they are zastrčení somewhere in the corner, because they need the experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and state is on the right track.
Today is thriving vkusovština.
The same erarta, but differ by honestly say that not all modern art we are artists, who would have to look for other museums.
- what you believe is petěrburk?
- petěrburk - this is not the capital of culture, culture is much more in Moscow, there is the right soil.
and on our waste art are abjectly.
We need cultural land, but for us today is more writers than readers, this is wrong.
in Europe is very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
For us it is such a class only weak.
We need art has become the issue, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is implemented for the funds grant st.petěrburku
Born in space
The country is in danger.
global warming or collision zabijáckým an asteroid strike.
The space korábů with Union, on board are embarking on the path, looking for a spare planet.
to save mankind, the question arises: how to keep your family in conditions beztíže or spare on the planet?
I think that the choice is not great.
In fact, there are only two of the planet, that it is possible to adopt, even if only hypoteticky.
"This is Venus and Mars," says a senior scientific worker national astronomic in Institute P. K.\ xC5 ternberga (SAI\ xC5) Vladimir surdin.
But while better conditions for Life on Mars, on the surface of Venus are temperature 500 degrees Celsius.
live there is possible only in the level or Denobula Venus... in space.
to address the issue of reproduction in space to scientists with flora.
For half a century ago attempts have been made to the plants.
four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their pozemských relatives.
After an open insects in a corridor - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979 was sent into space křepelčí eggs to check how the embryo develops in a state of beztíže.
The output we are absolutely normal ball.
But then the problems begin.
"there is a problem with the fact that this bird must find support, must stand on its own two feet and start to move," says a leading laboratory Institute biomedicínských problems (ibmp) wounds Vladimir syčev.
If there is support, birds fall chaotically and doing kotrmelce.
After 10 hours, with newly vylíhnutých birds to complete the instincts.
the birds have not responded to light or sound.
and the problem was that, in four days simply died.
"twice we had vylíhnout birds, but then we refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them," comments on the failure of the experiment for its chickens in space Vladimir syčev.
The last "miniarcha" animals letěla into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will be to continue the experiments.
In biosatelitu "bion" but will only being one gender.
There was an experiment with potkany who were broadcasting into space already gravidní.
In fact there have not any identified supernatural.
"It was only on biosatelitech, but again, this is a unique experiment and such attempts to be implemented," said Vladimir syčev.
After landing on the ground with a space potkanům had offspring.
Moving to the problem of reproduction directly in space, however, failed.
It is a difficult task.
animals in the loss of the usual environmental simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
One, unlike animals, can in principle.
Homo sapiens is an abstract thinking and is able to create appropriate emotional background.
for ethical reasons, do not carry out such experiments.
But women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkova's.
nejdrahocennější thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Čajka flew and no one in the country could not say whether for years in space.
whether after a flight can give birth to a child.
"After all, no one did not reply to this question," says veteran raketově-vesmírného sector vachtang vačnadze.
In June 1964, more than a year after the flight into space, gave birth to the first žena-kosmonautka Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The child's father was also kosmonaut andrijan nikolajev.
In 1988 was born the son of other ženě-kosmonautce světlaně savické that visited corridor twice and also worked in an open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few kosmonautů, which after years of birth and rising health descendants.
"Moreover, it can be dangerous in orbitálních years," says kosmonaut-pilot, hero of the Soviet Union and Russia's hero valerij poljakov.
humanity must still inevitably seek new ways in the areas of biotechnology, radiological protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
hydrolaboratoř cpk is compulsory stage of preparations for the flight.
Here in conditions with zero appeal kosmonauti embrace habits needed to work in an open space.
water have imitations of the security beztíže.
Even if the water is for adults, while comfortable, but in a strange environment for small children is a natural živlem.
small ichtiandři seems to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that the child is in an average of nine months in matčině amniotic fluid water and that it is easier for them přivyknout to water.
In principle it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first vykoupání, only 2 weeks later.
"This is very little to child something forgotten," says instruktorka swimming newborn Marina aksenovová.
In short, if it is for the newborn baby of beztíže more natural state, then for women is more natural essential gravity, attractive force.
In a state of beztíže is very quickly to chřadnutí břišních muscles, muscles basin is the ability of the body to expel the fetus.
We can leave aside, if they work stimulátory action muscles in childbirth.
After all, it is possible that the birth was in a special Chamber, in which the body of the mother of the fetus.
"and then what?" is valerij poljakov difficult questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs an artificial felt.
If it is not on the organism to state the right to form the headings or set of muscles.
newborn in orbit is not possible obléci as an adult to a special suit to the burden, in which he could train.
simply will be deprived of what absolutely needs to their development.
"If we go with you to experiment, which allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we bring to the country with an impaired person, which will be completely nepřizpůsobená zdejšímu environment," predicts the Commission on bioethics ibmp wounds Igor pestov.
So having children in the universe today is only a theoretical question.
One, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when pozemšťané follow in their korábech on a long planet, which will be home to their offspring born in space.
\ xC5 head nkú: control švarcsystému failed because of politicians
The Czech Republic has good supervisors in relation to public procurement and the quality of the legislation, but is lagging behind in its application.
In an interview for aktuálně.cz says Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office Miloslav kala.
"the law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing," comments on the current situation kala.
Similar conclusions also suggests the control of Czech and German controllers.
As an example of improper practice says approach Peter nečase to so-called "švarcsystému."
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS is not entrepreneurs bother his controls - so it is prohibited or permitted?
"the law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the obligations," notes kala.
The audit committee in the House, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German party, in which the was porovnávána procurement legislation in both countries.
What was specifically?
The parallel control that we have launched about two years ago.
Put simply, that the legislation is how to deal with public procurement, followed by the national legislation and then also the practice.
We have all of this together, and even if the control is not yet closed, we have very interesting differences - generally speaking, the legislation is perhaps "stricter and better for us," however, the practice is better in some parameters in Germany.
It is, therefore, that it is not enough to create still further and further more precise rules, but must be given to the application of the law.
What can help you in this project, what does this mean for you?
It is the kind of control could contribute to the effort to stop spending on specifying the laws, reducing and improvement of limits when it has a positive impact.
economy means to obtain appropriate thing for a reasonable (which is not always the lowest price) to rule out enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But, by reducing the limit orders, that we should not necessarily achieve.
It may be that the system zahltí such a "paper" that those who want to find holes in the system, so they will benefit from this much more easily than if the limit is higher.
You talk about domestic problems with other words transferring public procurement legislation into practice.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar our nkú, or is it set in?
As for the authorities, as nkú there is bundesrechnungshof, which is organised as we also has the College, is only slightly differently, but essentially both authorities doing likewise.
The powers are also similar to a certain extent, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement, so has the Court of Auditors and at the level of the Länder - that is the system a bit different from our own.
brh federal money with us can only control of state resources.
public funds, which are managed by us and the communities, there is the control of the level of federal courts of auditors.
As for the legislation, so it is easier than our?
In general I would without concrete data to the situation, however, in some ways, Germany is described as a model, but certainly not to say that it is all the better.
This is so even by the supervisors have better?
Certainly not, but, again, I do not like such a comparison.
But it has to be said that the countries which we consider to be a model, are faced with a number of problems.
Otherwise it has no benefit for them to work together with our office, no?
As for the domestic legislation that, for your office meant the amendment to the law on public procurement, are already evident in its effects?
Given that the duration of the amendment is relatively short, so we still not in control of events.
Because we do control ex post, is the need to count on a delay.
We see this not only in the process of preparing the future controls - nastartovali we have our new tool "risk detection inefficiencies," through which we prohnali almost 14 thousand public procurement, and we analyzed - there is the change of course will show, because the conditions will change the limits to amend certain types of the selection process and the like.
The adoption of this law, do you see more for benefits, or the additional burden of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope that it is the case.
The problem here may be that she "rewrite the rules" and it will not be possible to honour them.
for the previous rules are controlled people committed to the provider (for example, in the case of the regional operational programmes of the Regional Council) to each of the public procurement law is a violation of budgetary discipline.
So is the cost of the law in this way; eventually?
I do not think this way.
The system must exclude those who want it to attack and abuse, and not to punish those who commit a formal misconduct that does not affect the decision making.
Such a system will only create more pressure on bureaucracy.
and how out of this?
Let us show, where the road is not.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS entrepreneurs will not bother the controls of the so-called "švarcsystému" - and what it means?
\ xC5 varcsystém is prohibited or permitted?
The law must be somehow set after all, and if anything will ban, so did the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the office, which has a duty to go to monitor and enforce the requirement.
can say: "We will change the law and we allow this," but cannot say that we are going to do anything like that.
in the public procurement law are quite strict rules, as what is to be formally implemented - which is the right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when those with the best offer is out of the question for the formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be the right applications - this is what we believe is missing.
roads are places namrzlé majority but passable
In several places the Czech Republic roads namrzlé and also zasněžené.
But the majority are passable road somewhere with increased caution.

Shimon ornest: we want to build a positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the fact that is supposed to be the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the more alarmist, which we humans like to chytáme.
Together with the tap tap the do rather fun, and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to the end of the world oddálili or prevent it.
In December, uspořádáte absolutely unique project three concerts against the end of the world.
It can be closer to the readers?
The national benefiční action, which we have been planning for two years.
We have chosen to use the marketing potential of mayského calendar announced on 21 December morning at 11:10.
The day before the December 3 concerts will take place in parallel from 21 hours in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
will end around at a time when on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone will end mayský calendar.
who has come up with this idea?
Originally it was about my idea, then we all dream up, along with our stage artist honzou augustou.
In addition, that we want to build enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, along with the public to wonder what the state of one of this world will be passed on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of mayského calendar, we also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original klíčků against the end of the world whose buying on www.e-tap.cz us people can also support.
The tap tap Group, along with other singers also nazpívala so-called anthem cancelled against the end of the world, which is called the "end of the world."
Now it is very popular on YouTube, will also on these benefičních concerts?
Of course, in the end, if we all manage and the end of the world do not...
zazpívají it all interpreti on all three concerts in parallel.
anthem will link together in a direct transfer to the Czech television.
The words to the song he wrote and the role of Jesus in klipu plays Tomas HANÁK sings also xindl x...
As you have got to cooperate with them?
We are also working with the other members of the cultural scene, given that we hold a lot of benefičních events and concerts.
We are working intensively involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy.
in what will be the proceeds of concerts against the end of the world?
The equipment bezbariérového education centre studeo, already the sixth year of operations with civic associations tap in jedličkově constitution.
for school students jedličkova regularly are running out of instructors and address them in the activities of the constitution, which is entertaining and are interested in.
the students themselves do not have the means to be taken for lecturers ourselves, we are trying to allow them in this way.
In regards the construction of jedličkova constitution in the future there will be a separate building with this project in which we transfer.
on each koncertě floor several musical groups and performers.
According to what you picked?
We tried to build a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will speak Chinaski support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, the tap tap Marián bango and George dry.
All the details you learn to www.kpks.cz.
you are planning a similar "bombastické action 'in the future?
In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring, so here we certainly an interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year we would also like to zahráli in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, as we would like it has in the US, with speeches in Washington and in Chicago.
your foreign plans are minimalist, yet you have spoken out, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is, however, the group, which is made up of disabled people.
As these trips zvládáte logistically and organisationally?
It is not as terrible as it seems at first glance.
We have five Members on the electrical wheelchair, its cars to travel in zavazadlovém area, also, of course, faced with vláčíme large quantities of cargo and beden instruments...
However, has always performed without problems, CSA Czech Airlines and British Airways to us were well prepared, I often wondered up.
Even in Moscow, from which we returned recently, it was without problems.
Thanks to výjezdům abroad can compare how different the individual in bezbariérovosti, public access to hendikepovaným and the like.
What you have met?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than us, we have just seen in Russia in the East, that is all still in full beginning.
The Prague Moscow is very bariérová, here it is still unusual for one to an electrical wheelchair he instituted in the city centre.
There is not even a self-evident, as that to be wheelchair users should do you prefer in the lift.
Fortunately, there are also civil unions, which is trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
and what, on the other hand, we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are plenty of things in which we are still behind...
But it is important to mention that better and improving the situation is always dependent on the aspirations of the people involved.
in London and Madrid is perfectly normal that people with a heavy hendikepem of moving to the public, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not the usual power that there would be a lot of people with disabilities a more active part in social life, here we are, with the tap tap a little ahead!
respect for the public or bezbariérovost is one thing, but only when one of us will be leading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, and things really begin to change.
Yet they are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The band of tap tap is very popular at the moment to come back a couple of years back what you in 1998 led to establish it?
I came as vychovatel to jedličkova constitution, where I was around a lot of young people who were interested in something to address.
and as I myself muzikant, hraji including saxofon and I, along with my colleague iniciator zájmový music circle.
So over time we, as is our moderator láďa angelovič, a little out of hand (Laughter).
But the popularity has come up in recent years, am I wrong?
It is true that help us when we started to connect the familiar singers and also to work actively to promote the band.
We have seen that work, which is, in fact, as would not exist.
Thanks to the contributions from the European Union, we can afford good lecturers, equipment and so on.
was your goal to go with the tap tap this high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential, that we can do something different.
showbusiness is crowded things where one have imitations of the security.
This is the logical way, everything new is accepted carefully and it takes a long time.
The things that are unique, there is very little, but I venture to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us for the first time, is, of course, sorry, this is natural...
But the sympathy is totally unnecessary, because people with hendikepem no suffering all abandoned beings, which we regret.
These are the people who can live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means to do so.
I say that when something in people with hendikepem, so this is not the only for them, but for the whole of society.
to this success, that you have a strict boss, as you said that many people?
If we want to do good work, we need to be tough on many issues and require a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion and head in the clouds, and when they discover that must twice a week to go to the test, be on the product and spend a lot of time on your concerts, it is the enthusiasm quickly leave.
This is the way it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and who want to achieve something.
Currently, the band of tap tap 20 members.
How many of them were on its beginnings in 1998?
only one láďa angelovič.
We open group, people come and go, this cannot be avoided.
who has the will and the taste is always open the door for us
It will be the day before the expected at the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 p.m.
will take place in Prague incheba arena, Brno flédě and Ostrava plynojemu with 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
All three cities at the end of the evening will connect telemostem in common singing the songs of the band tap tap cancelled "the end of the world '
The concert is to collect funds for equipment multifunkčního bezbariérového education centre studeo in jedličkově Institute in Prague in the $25 million.
admission to the concert is 400 Kč, children have access to 12 years free tickets in předprodeji bohemiaticket
Poland and kosmos.
last week was at the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency made Poland as the 20th Member of the European Space Agency, as other countries from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA, on 12 November 2008).
Poland has launched close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and in the other years contributed to a number of projects agency.
However, Poland's path to space began much earlier.
flights into space to Polish enthusiasts before the Second World War; but not always meet with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, a lecture A.\ xC5 ternfelda in Warsaw astronomical observatory, which was the idea of their pioneering work on 6 December 1933 entry into kosmonautiky.
The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) to cool listener and after years of\ xC5 ternfeld vzpomínal that only Dr John gadomski wondered about his work.
\ xC5 ternfeld in 1934, for entry into the kosmonautiky in France price Robert esnault-pelterieho and André Louis hirscha.
vzpomenutý doctor John gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a major promoter of astronomy and kosmonautiky.
in the Polish journals published hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on these vědním disciplínám.
gadomski has become world famous promoter of kosmonautiky and his contribution has been acknowledged by the fact that one of the kráterů on the dark side of the moon was named on his behalf.
already in 1925 was built in Poland kolejová trolley, which should be a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is known and not known or the details of the project.
It is not clear whether the missile should be used for the start-up drezíny or to its zabrzdění.
information about the peak are known only from dobového press.
since 1933 the rocket missiles began to deal with the Polish artillery.
research for komórka techniki uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. mieczyslawem wolfkem and Prof. gustawem mokrzyckiegim.
from dochovaných materials, it is clear that research has now reached the stage of prakzických tests.
However, the arrival of German troops research was interrupted.
in 1937, in the professional press suggested fotoelektrické purchasing missiles by engineer rohoziński and have come to work in the coming year rakieta - torpeda powietrzna and rakietobomba lotnicza author leliwy-krzywoblockého.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of military use rocket technology to temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which all work coordinated.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of his work put an end to the war.
further work on the space after the war in the Polish press is thanks to the work of the Polish astronautické society (polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time is the reference to society in the November edition of the magazine in 1954 problemy, in which there are four broader articles on the subject of astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society that will deal with kosmonautikou.
At the time, already rozbíhaly projects artificial satellites and it was clear that the space research is promising field.
Since the beginning of the year, 1956, the Polish astronautická society (PTA) snažia to join the international astronautické Federation (founded 1951) and already in the autumn, PTA has become a full member.
and in the next year, the first President of PTA take zarankiewicz (cafés - 1959) has become a Vice-President of the international astronautické Federation.
This function held until his death in 1959.
since 1956, PTA significantly contributed to the development of very successful weather rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which has conducted scientific research.
The first type of rm-1 was completed in 1957, the first start, 10 October 1958.
rocket with dostupem 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and her weight was less than 5 kg.
later was built an enhanced version of rm-1a and started in the summer of 1959 in bledovské desert flight tests dvoustupňové rockets rm-2.
the missile has been long 1.4 standards and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
further development of the real scientific work - should be able to have the rocket rm-34 should have dostup to 14.5 km and its task was monitoring výškového wind.
However, further development was suspended in 1962.
the successor to the first missiles of RM has become rocket meteor-1 developed from 1962 to them.
The rocket was designed as a dvoustupňová, its overall length was 510 cm and the weight was 32,5 kg.
were developed three types of (marked meteor-1a, -1b and -1c) that was different sizes area for scientific equipment.
In raketě meteor-1a was available space on the volume of 0.4 liter of meteor-1b of 0,34 litres of meteor-1c of 0,62 litres of.
The maximum dostup for all three types of the 37 km.
The situation between flights and 1968 was in the aviation Institute of development rockets meteor-2, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
rocket meteor-2 had the weight of 380 kg and was able to bring useful burden weighing 10 kg to a height of around 60 km.
then versions were built meteor-2h and meteor-3.
It is important to mention Poland's entry into cosparu (Committee for space research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee cospar two years later.
Poland is also under the interkosmos involved in space research area to Soviet artificial družicích and in 1978, the Polish pilot miroslaw hermaszewski became after Vladimir remkovi second interkosmonautem.
repeal of the law on public work is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court of law on public work.
The resolution triggered a lively debate in public.
Certainly it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
liberal oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in a globalised world are based on the principle of more unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that individual economic services, national economic systems, is in the permanent conflict between us.
The cause is the principle of free trade and free of unrestrained movement of private capital, along with unrestrained financial speculation.
due to significant price differences work, wages) There are price tension.
Under this concept is the need to understand the situation, when producers are trying to import cheap goods to compete in the competition by "podrazí" price competitor with an aim to shoulder a greater share of the market and thus increase their profits.
on a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs either translate production abroad, or they buy cheaply, or zaniknout.výsledkem is high unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared with other economies.
because private capital has no social responsibility and the responsibility for it vyprodukovanou unemployment, are necessarily the social costs of the state.
The situation underscores the absolute reluctance by businesses to pay taxes and replace it with economic and social a social damage done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so widely known that there is no need to include specific statistics.
the unscrupulous practices of private capital different economies are in a situation where national governments are forced to join the competition in order to artificially reduce the welfare of its people in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments, private capital to its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is particularly in changes of the law.
The aim is economically to force their own population adopted a diktat of private capital, particularly in terms of wages.
This is the system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment, and limiting the rights of workers in the area of employment rights.
The result is a growing poverty, together with the increase in the gap between the rich and poor.
In srn exist for a number of years public výdejny food for the poor, who cannot make a living from their work.
The number of these people are already in the millions.
In the increasing competitiveness of the German economy is routinely to cases that properly employed people receive a wage that they must pay to the state subsistence.
This scandal was published, and in the case of the auxiliary staff Bundestag.
austerity measures in all the southern states inevitably lead to the same situation when people are under pressure from the catastrophic decline in social standards forced either to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or živořit for starvation wages on the fringes of society in the hope that the country might again come the private investment capital.
There is a need to hear but where it comes from?
If this is from other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another, or not at all, because the Chinese, Indian, brazilec or Turk, marokánec or Egyptian or African would still work for a fraction of the salaries.
This applies across Latin America.
The liberal theories and media ad nauseam argue that the state cannot participate in the capital on its own economy, that the command economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital for insisting on the position that the state must not managing interventions to intervene in the economy.
Then we need to ask whether private equity do not affect, it is now policy and the state in their own egoistickém sense.
There is a clear answer that yes.
The proof is the existence of virtually powerful and ubiquitous in all States lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in terms of corruption in the area of providing those benefits, where virtually everything is reprehensible, but nothing criminal.
In srn situation is such that the State Department for lack of money commissioning a draft law private legal firms, which are frequently in conjunction with the industry.
These amendments are then agreed in the Bundestag.
all the power in this way does not come from people as they claim the constitution of the Western type, but financially strong groups preferujících own interests.
It is clear that as the liberal democracy is now quickly get into the situation, as it describes appiános in their work in the crisis of the Roman Republic caesara and pompeia: "the state has been long in the decay and authorities obsazovaly violence.
for bribes, illegal obtaining good graces and with stones or swords.
bribery and corruption bujely without any hindrance and people walked to the elections with a prodaným voice... "charakterní people the office at all neucházeli, so one was as a result of this disruption was the state eight months without konzulů".... "began to talk about the fact that the only remedy in a bad situation is indeed samovláda and that it should be a strong man." appiános is thought to pompeia, but became the Caesar, which changed it took on democracy in samovládu.
Finally, as well as in antice is the current society based on reckless preference their own benefit regardless of celospolečenský interest.
Private capital is not inherently unable to understand and apply celospolečenský benefit.
The result is now, as then, the unprecedented decadence elites without any efforts to reform the deeper nature.
kauzalitu the fascist and Communist regimes so we have found in the reckless economic liberalisation of the 19th and 20th century.
for the current state of the demise of these systems can be in favour of a liberal democracy, such as a break with the expectations of the next round.
particularly disastrous is completely ignore the fact that the elite in the future possible statisícové loss of life, the humanitarian and social disaster, which we have now seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of competition both on the international and European level of interior of the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The solution is targeted politicko- social reforms to strengthen the capital of the state in the economy, strengthen the influence of the government and weaken the monopoly position of private equity in the company in favour of the state.

We have to accept that we live in a time when the world is wealth zkoncentrováno in the hands of a few individuals and that the concentration of money and the resulting power could not be in the life of a generation.

JFK to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed was murdered, 1963, a member of the Louis MC fadden was in 1936 otráven after I of this nature before the Fed for starting the Great Depression in 1929.
their desire for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan of three world wars zednářem Supreme's 33rd degree of dedication albertem pikem.
The first war had the task of removing large monarchistické state units in Europe, the second was to remove the colonial Manor in Britain and the third has lead to the reduction of some of the world's population to 0.5 - 1 billion people (the amount of slaves to their comfort and luxury is enough and are not consumed so many resources), the creation of a universal religion (ekumenismus is nothing other than předpolí) for such a solution and end of absolute power.
The method by which the Group of the richest families in the rothschieldy works is causing the crisis and subsequent offering solutions (to AB Chao - order of chaos).
But these solutions are false and are always a deterioration of the situation (see the Fed to prevent crisis like the one that created in 1907).
So, after they have been an assassination habsburského successor r-u throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo unleash destroy Tsarist Russia in the First World War, the Bolshevik revolution.
the first World War ended a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified kapitulací Germany (no longer needed to be war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and then there has been the central powers, Austria uherska.
for easier starting World War II left bankers policy to create latentně conflict situation by Germany have huge war reparations, which created the radicalisation of the impoverished masses and then had them only selling Germans strong enough blame označujícího and simple solutions offer a leader, and the creation of a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should play, and also played the role of fifth columnists in sparking a fire.
At the end of the 19th-century encourage rothschieldové one branch of the establishment of the Zionist movement, which sought to create a Jewish state, preferenčně historical judeje with Jerusalem as the capital of (return) to the parameters.
Already the balfourova declaration of a prerequisite for mass immigration Jews to Palestine, it has to be the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, whether Hitler utrhl of chain, which it initially international bankers to, or what was in the plan to the suffering of the Jews in Europe, it is difficult to estimate, koncentrácích created a prerequisite for the world community acceptance of the Jewish state.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as war reparations Germany a 2.světovou war, the war of the declaration of the state of Israel was created.
If it can unleash the international bankers, will be at the forefront of the victims of the Jewish nation, as in the second, now, together with the Arab or Muslim populations of the Middle East in general.
Israel is not only as a laboratory, the source of contention and chaos in the country, but also internationally (consider just how sharply divided people on Israel's supporters and opponents.
Who is guilty and who the victim in palestinsko - Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds wrong in the never-ending chain of violence when, at the beginning of all this, the greed of individuals and their desire for global power?
There is a need to distinguish simple people Israel from their leaders, because, as in the US, podstrkují international bankers people to choose exclusively their own candidates in the elections.
Israel's current Prime Minister Netanyahu hawk is a typical example of fašizujícího to international bankers loajálního, a policy that it is doing all it can to a war with Iran, which, given the membership country Iran at - the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and to control Iran over hormuzským tunnel, which travel 20% of all the world's oil (shipping corridor is just 2 miles wide) and the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what now seems the words which vyřkl David Rockefeller in 1994: "What we need is a general crisis and people will agree with the new world order."
a new world order in their vision of the world masters and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is the comfort of a few financial aristocracy.
The world, where everyone is newly narozenému individuals implanted chip at birth, that making it totally controlled person.
"and to all small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to have on the right hand or at the forefront of branded, not to buy or sell, who is awarded on behalf of the beast or číslicí of its name.
It is important to understand: who has the sense whether sečte number of the beast.
This figure is a man, and that is the number of šestset sixty six."
The film Argo: when is the worst call Hollywood
the American Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 Islamist students occupied a crowd of demonstrators, and by 52 diplomats hostage.
should be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed rézu páhlavího, who fled to the US after the revolution, which has been the patron of his regime for several decades.
for the US administration situation offered positive way out - to the Shah overboard because they could not afford, so fundamentally undermine the confidence in the allies in other countries.
The release of the hostages but in Iran, where the revolution has resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, has been unable to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later deepened the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detention of the diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, then what negotiations give alžírská government.
their fate at home has led to a wave of solidarity and protiíránského sentiment.
The debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the Jimmy Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film režírujícího actor Ben afflecka Argo describes one episode of that history, that America has a small victory.
Just before obsazením there from it have left six employees.
after difficult peripetiích ended up in the residence of Canadian Ambassador.
the CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to get help from Iran, while extravagantní coating story - went to Canadian passports as members of the film, which in the country obhlížel locations for shooting sci-fi velkofilmu.
The combination of genres
The plan, which was an expert on "exfiltraci" Tony Mendez, require the cooperation of Hollywood.
that narrative was credible, made a film project in specialised magazínech, there were press conference, a fake production company had real office.
The details of the operation were a long time utajovány, the film is based on the memories of Tony mendeze.
affleckův film is a special combination of more genres.
On the one hand, realistically pojatý political thriller, at the same time, the so-called "caper movie," the story of vydařeného bit by bit, podrazu example - can be a series of dannyho parťáků.
they change the mood in the film - on the one hand, dokumentárně broad sequence of Tehran (titulkové sequence are ukazovány ikonické period photographs of events and the way in which the same situation were shown satellite in the film - the differences are not).
On the other hand, lightweight passages of Hollywood, pojednané with irony and a slight exaggeration.
and then, the scene of CIA headquarters and other institutions -muži in suits consider the situation at negotiating tables in the corridors of the phone...
benovi affleckovi remarkable way made restart career.
from vysmívaného actor became a respected režisérem and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is the third feature film, after dark krimi: baby: (2007) and thrilleru city (2010).
At the same time, it is the first affleckův picture, which is not taking place in režisérově Heimathafen Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place, was among the characteristics that režisérovy older films povyšovaly over hollywoodský standard.
and affleck it also apparent in argu, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are taking place in the streets, in rekonstruování real events - the sequence of there is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time, thrilling emoci confusion and nepřevídatelnosti that arise when somewhere along move history.
a similar effect affleck and his colleagues are in scénách fabricated (false staff on teheránském bazaru).
too many events in too many places
The director had to deal with the fact that vyprávěný story offers, the power in terms of exciting film scenes.
quite successfully with the little work, sometimes to the reality of something přimyslí - all there so elegantly not (the scene in which the impending crisis in teheránském airport reverse call in America and chase after ranveji are quite far-fetched).
weakness arga but roztěkanost resulting from the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan arkin and John goodman reels in Hollywood collaborators while very šaramantní, their characters, but have deserved more space and are far from the only in that movie.
affleckův film a losing a dramatic move, this is the picture that it is possible to monitor with mild interest, to pay tribute to the implementation of the retro style evoking thrillery 1970s.
But push hard to.
As a reminder of one has a way of living history and proof, as are exaggerated ideas about všemocných and vševědoucích secret services, but will be enough.
The rules for nafukování balónků, bananas and circus
server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which every year declaring anketu very ridiculous banking fee, has now decided to declare the competition on "the very ridiculous regulation or ideas from the EU."
"This led us to the last event when the EU plans to adopt 40procentní quota for women on the boards of large European companies," said organizer law polls patrik nacher.
between leave something absurditami is already, for example, the recent decision by the European Court of premium rates for men and women.
Still, women were in the prices of the life insurance beneficiary, because they are objectively less risk for insurance companies.
"another incredible ideas from the EU can nominate people by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013," informed nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulation is even the mandatory blend of biosložek into fuel, which as a result of the damage to nature, to ban the use of reliable mercury teploměrů just because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the size of slepičích cages, for which this year significantly zdražila eggs.
The criticism before he was also de facto ban on the use of the term pomazánkové butter or exclusion from the sale of incandescent bulbs.
The quality of the bananas have 14 centimeters
The apparatus is often under pressure from either commercial or industrial lobby, whose requirements in Brussels usually defend a State or group of states (and the Czech Republic now and the threat of a veto by the demands of their banks).
The interests of the cost for this, for example, that the high quality of bananas had to achieve in the Union of at least 14 cm and will be prevented from showing "anomalous curvature."
The European Commission has prevented by just harmonises the non-uniform national standards that with the trade.
standards on fruit and vegetables, the EU despite the opposition of some States změkčila with reference to the fact that the directive will lead to food waste.
candidate to victory in the questionnaire may be the last year's EU regulation, which must be sold on inflatable balónků Povinně warning that children under 8 years old must expand without adult supervision.
The EU has appealed to the US research, in which the balloons are the leading cause of death of children toys to suffocation.
Similar restrictions now applies to children under 14 years in foukání to pouťových frkaček.
curious ideas are born at home
It is quite absurd rule relating to the European officials - anyone who has a formal role in the EU with regard to the sensitivity of the issue for Greece cannot use the name of Macedonia and must instead to talk about the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
server bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the liberal economists laissez faire nominoval in the polls among some of the above absurdit even on the territory of a Member State of the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks, which could find in the Czech Republic on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then crossed for the volumes of canned mushrooms, for which he was threatened high fine.
the organisers of the polls has taken the idea of pay in some countries that do not have the sea, and the idea of the subsidies at the request of the subsidies.
But these ideas have not come in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We handicapováni that we do not have the sea.
We ask the European Union for the refund," said in the autumn of 2004, then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (19).
As the argument said that with us urodilo a lot of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases should be full of warehouses, which had to export.
For that, the Czech Republic has further to the ports, the EU had us under palase pay hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission, to meet Czech by organised tendr to buy grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
the subsidy to obtain subsidies offered by the Department for local communities, controlled development Minister Paul German (us-deu), in particular, should go to a request on subsidies from Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulation are the exception
The regulation is easily become the target of criticism in the Member States of the EU efforts to regulation and at the same time, a more efficient operation and development of the entire Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
The more serious problem, according to experts, for example, the absorption of EU subsidies for projects that are not sign something in common with the deepening European integration, but which the Member States to force in the budget negotiations.
emotions between Čechy is that, as well as other EU countries in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to specific indications of its traditional products, and not always succeed in this struggle.
While the Czechs after a six-year battle with the Germans and rakušany fight our corner the olomouckých tvarůžků, but the domestic rum, whose tradition for us dates back to the 19th century had to rename our producers to tuzemák.
name, can only be products from třtinového destilátu, and not from sugar beet.
In the EU's official list of registered products in the company of internationally renowned cheese feta and gorgonzola, marcipánu of German lübecku or parmské hams, for example, has been karlovarské suchary, pohořelický and třeboňský carp and žatecký chmel.
the mark of the EU, can also boast pardubický perník and hořické trubičky.
People want to zachraňoval Republic, but I am amateur, says okamura
Mr senátore as man attacks that wants to run for President?
I am not to be a Senator or President.
If it worked in our country without any problems, so nowhere nekandiduji.
already, but I cannot see how the last 20 years the country rozkrádá how the thieves běhají, people are raising taxes and the retirement age.
I did not have the ambition to be policies.
But when I see something I like, so I try to come up with a solution to this change.
And since I was already 40 and I am an independent nestraník, I have another opportunity to influence things, than to run for Senator or President.
You have got to the Senate, but you soon took off for the castle.
neotáčíte it back to the people who elected you?
all the time I said that in the fight on the castle I go according to the outcome of the elections to the National Assembly and the Senate.
later I have made it clear that if I elected Senator, I will run for President.
But my aim is not the function of the tool, how can I realise their vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and what the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that, but as a nation that nadáváme in bar and in front of the television, but that pošlapeme anyone who wants to try to change.
The media will follow that person dehonestují and confuse freedom and freedom of speech.
about me, to be argued that uplácím journalist or that I was adviser George paroubka.
Let us to your vision.
criminal liability in the fight on the castle you took off with the assumption of material and politicians, and the feedback property of over 20 million.
You need to change the law.
As President but you do not have such power and the Senate as a whole can only propose laws.
How do you intend to resolve it?
When I lobbied for it as a citizen, to průvodcovství was free business, managed to carry this through.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good proposal left or right, naschvál reject it, citizens resident.
As an independent nestraník I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My priority is that without give partisan labels and dogmas, I can take something from every party, what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you see more as a right-wing or left-wing?
from the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more to the left of me.
For me it is not at all important, if a little to the left, or a little Airport.
It is important for me to go ahead.
I am not about whether someone on the left or right, but I want to bring people together.
I always support any public good solution, even though it will propose ksčm or the ODS party, and just as I will be against bad idea.
čertíte, when people tell you that you are a populist.
But nedokazujete that what you said?
When tvoříte byznysplán in the company, and you have an ideal target and vision.
and you are trying to bring.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals, which I am talking about, even in the world of work, or the major experts talking about them.
But without the support of Parliament you there is nothing left passwords.
and with that, in politics, in the long term nevystačíte.
or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, that you will be able to, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
persuading politicians, journalists and the public and try to get on board to push this.
If I was elected President, is not a problem to TV watch, where I will ask the President of the parliamentary parties to enact material and criminal responsibility for the policy, officials, judges and prosecutors.
and they would eventually have to say why they did not want it.
When will a strong personality, which will be pojmenovávat abuses can push on the political scene.
take the direct election of the President, it was the credit of the public pressure.
Frankly I amateur, that I am not a genius, or intellectual.
for their views and vision I try to look for allies.
I only started in politics and will try to obtain majority support for his program.
things are trying to move himself, if not for the six years I finish and I will come back to privátního sector.
It sounds like a little okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a saviour.
I know that one person is not, therefore I obcházel many famous people, whether they also nekandidovali in the Senate.
I went for radimem jančurou rejected it because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jan lorencovou that rozkrývala fraud with light topnými oils.
I ran with the fact that people are really unhappy, but I am now in the balance.
Sixty per cent of people not to vote and the majority of those who went to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, only two independent.
people navolili Senate so that the changes will promote difficult.
But I will fight for their vision, such as for the direct election of mayors or hejtmanů.
you are thinking about the establishment of his own party?
On this I still neuvažoval, because I do not have time to examining the net past every potential straníka, and I do not have the money for it.
I do not have the money or the presidential campaign on my transparent account is only 20,000.
You do not have the money?
You talk about confessions, what is your property?
private property I predict about 60 million.
I have the site in Prague for roughly 25 million, flat in 10 million, another flat for eight million collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and damage you for a million and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, Aston Martin I have, therefore, that this was my klukovský dream - I always liked James Bond, which was courteous to the women in his car, and at the same time, fought against the wrongs of the excesses.
You Aston Martin, you have a property for 60 million and you don't have the money to the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money in this power to you.
This is not very convincing.
I have 15 million for the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
The campaign I vrazil for 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, is indicative of my programme is not about such an interest.
and I have a duty to pay from his campaign.
The cost of the campaign, in fact, will cover what I receive senátorský salary.
But it would nevyžil, for example, I could not pay the son of the English school, that is 30,000 per month.
If I only earn money and nowhere nekandiduji.
you continue to do so, you can live?
You said that these activities utlumíte?
But this has nothing to do with one's salary.
As I promised, their activities I partially muted.
For example, Executive Director cestovky my representatives will happen in the spring.
people would like to be samaritán, which will save the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
How much you as a businessman was used to take a month?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I take further.
and if I were President, I would like its business end.
The entire interview can be found in the weekly release rights.
The architects of the mvrdv are proof that the real adventure neodehrávají only in the head - for example, Spijkenisse and recently built mountain books - 2 pictures
"The building seems to me to be cheerful, looks futuristicky. Finally is once again to see something interesting," says lisette verhaig that goes around after the roads.
Stefan spermon the techniques in the middle of a large company, is: "of course, this is a nice House."
I wonder, however, what we need today library.
all have the Internet, ipady and electronic books.
In any of these libraries in the old style already voluntarily no one not, or Yes?
Spijkenisse, settlements in close proximity to Rotterdam without their own jobs, which are not worth the visit, holding special record.
This community with 80 000 people, the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
to resolve this stupid situation, there were a few years ago the decision to contribute to the general education and to build seven nicely pomalovaných železobetonových miniatures fictitious bridges that are vyobrazené on euro notes.
The success of the educational offensive but was not the sheer.
and so the urban councillors know that there is only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library.
winy Maas of rotterdamského architectural studio mvrdv, master wildly brave sloupcových graphs and contractor for vtipných, often even cynical buildings, adopted a thing with the usual stoicism and the competition in 2003 appeared with five books under his arm and úšklebkem on my face.
And while the Commission even ohromeně rozhlížela around and krčila shrug vršil free Maas some presents to themselves according to the size and its aktivisticky zdůvodněnou conclude the words "kind of urban community."
So this is my proposal for a mountain of books in Spijkenisse, the so-called boekenberg!
Nine years later, mountain for EUR 30 million navršena.
It is part of the revitalizačního project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few surrounding residential and ordinary home with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November was mountain books vyznamenána second place "best library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the cost of the Dutch national wood award 2012.
maloměstská šeď, which has been unable to offer more than a post-modern pedestrian zone and extremely ugly town hall, for which white facade would you rather expected mlékárnu is thanks to richer on a bit of contemporary architecture.
First of all, but it has now Spijkenisse first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long road to paper
First impression: čtenářské eldorado will under poklopem cheeses.
The means of the mountains while the elevator, but the real spatial and čtenářské passions discover to walk in negotiations with topography.
from all sides prosklený interior is bright and clear, floors of páleného kabřince and elegant street lucerny clearly express the atmosphere of the square.
the urban environment is perfect.
You can see the Park iron garden, the dog and the boys and girls who play football.
and everywhere books, books, books.
"normally costs Shelvings with books along fronts and in the midst of a dark room, which is usually neútulný and impersonal," says winy Maas.
We have the classic prostorovou configuration turned upside down and we have room for readers vysunuli from the inside out.
vnitřek mountains of books is cleverly exploited: on Wednesday, are the offices of the library, šachový club, environmental centre and ústředna House technology.
Special potěchou are black police on books that are one lining the walls, one parapetem and sometimes zábradlím down the stairs.
The structure and the stench is cize.
the unknown building material kroutí heads even zapřisáhlí architects and engineers.
"We wanted to work with recyklovanými materials," says joop trouborst, head of the project in the urban Spijkenisse, to the question of the standard.
and so we are in one fríském farm one day come up against a waste product from agriculture.
For many years the sklenících and in the fields in the Netherlands is used as the basis under the roots of milimetrové fleece from synthetic matter.
It is a cheap and effective.
thin textiles for one, two season and then it is ripe for being in bulky waste.
The library was the fleece - for the first time in this volume - slisováno on boards with a thickness of four inches.
between the heat and the pressure of the so-called landbouwplastic (klp) zbarví in dark, homogeneous and zatížitelný material that stinks of a little as a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 will take you to the top of the stairs.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also holandskými kroketami and fíkusy in květináčích.
They are the caretakers of the atmosphere, but mainly on the right of the humidity in the literature.
donations for the new soul
"You might believe, but this House is despite many skleněným plochám a project, in terms of the environment," says trouborst.
vytápí and chladí Earth's heat.
Although mountain books costs under skleněným poklopem, the sun shines in only briefly, and even in the sunny days.
The broad lepené wooden vazníky, which is the major axis to prosklené façade, serves as the and capture a large part of the solar radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest will fully automatic rolety.
Stefan spermon, initial sceptic of the industry, have visited the new library.
Even lisette verhaig was already there.
and also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia bogarde that boekenberg even referred to as "long awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: each of the city's population was a few weeks ago invited to the opening of the book from his personal funds to pay one.
should first be sealed optical gaps in not yet fully equipped library, which currently includes 70 000 units.
The concept has been proven.
police are crowded with completely.
"There is nothing worse than half empty library," says architect winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now has a new house each of a relationship.
Everyone knows that his knížka is part of the building.
Even if it is only as an embellishment.
This mvrdv zadařilo in Royal discipline in technical jargon says the identity.
Spijkenisse written literary history.
whether any of the young and uneducated.
This is, in the end, the starting point for identity.
szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role '
Germany abstained in the admission of Palestine.
According to an expert on relations between the US and Europe Stephen szaboa that Berlin is close to the edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany at the beginning of the week, signalled that it would vote against the proposal to the Palestinians observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why?
Stephen szabo: Germany doesn't support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, the Germany because of its special relationship with Israel must be cautious.
But at the same time, I think, that will not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, was too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained during the vote, when it comes to establishing a no-fly zone.
Here, in the end, pushed through NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that it is changing its foreign policy away from the policy, which was run by the US, as it were, in the direction of German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult that Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between two lines.
It is expected from them that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think the role of the only have taken hold, but they are on the road to more "normal" foreign policy.
In foreign policy, as they do in France or in the UK.
what specifically is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
shows preparedness to take in the case of national interests and attitudes that are independent of the attitudes of the US or European partners.
I think that the German foreign policy, economic policy is motivated, export and its relations with some areas, like Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are, to a certain extent, other than the economic interests of other powers, and must therefore Germany to protect their interests.
Should the economic interests of the impact on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has a large market in the Middle East, particularly in states around the Persian Gulf.
That is why it must be careful to neodstrašilo public, but not the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, plays a role.
I would not like this but not to give too much of it is not completely one-sided relationship.
In any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
damaged Germany's relations with the US, when Germany in the case of both important decision-making abstentions, for example, in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the US there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not think that it was as dramatic as a watershed in the issue of Libya.
Perhaps even Germany are extracted some respect.
It signals that must be considered as an international player and its interests have to be taken into account.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, in contrast, clearly expressed for the veto.
There are differences between the US and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of the internal policy.
I think that the Obama administration has some secret by a great deal of sympathy for the European position.
But as a result of the political situation cannot hold this position, of course, publicly.
I think that differences of opinion are not really as great as always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu and Obama is not at all happy with any power netanjahuovou policy.
It is not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand, and the position of the most important partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that is exactly what the Germans difficult.
for the Germans, of course, would be a bit easier if there was a coherent and united European policy, which is currently not the case.
They cannot be part of a broader line and must instead of pushing things forward from its own position.
Yet this is precisely what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that Germany takes a leading role in the future and will push Europe to the European position.
It is not easy for Germany, of course, for the sake of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear that the Germans must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself as a major international player? wants to take the role at all?
Or is the leading role for Germany still difficult?
Germany is still accustomed to it, it is still uncomfortable, and for this country is still difficult to play a greater role for obvious reasons.
When, for example, look at the European crisis, as always, when Germany will take a greater role for protiněmecké mood.
do not that the Germans facilitate.
It is, in fact, the old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be acceptable to all neighbours and views and that is not easy.
US influence in European politics now is constantly falling, however, the EU this vacuum currently nevyplňuje. who is otherwise there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like them is unpleasant and it will be even more neoblíbenějšími - c'est la vie!

"the protection of brands" in China: when are Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
For this is a label that is quite officially registered in China, but the company has nothing to do with the original.
of protection, however, as long as it is nezažalují real brand owners.
and even then it is not clear whether the domohou rights.
"for foreigners, it is becoming increasingly difficult to protect its brand in China," says Thomas pattloch, a lawyer in the office Taylor wessing, which specializes in protective rights violations in the Far East.
every week přistane on my work table a new case.
counterfeiters have just a few letters, so that they can log their brand.
of the Gucci brand, for example, will become lu-gucci and instead of Prada will register prada-kny.
In this way they are legally kopírovány German firms to be sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
pattloch opens pořadač records Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, there was one Chinese company to protect brand zegna df Puma artificial name that parazituje and the House ermenegildo zegna.
It is known that the Chinese are masters of the world in copying and violations of intellectual property.
in large cities are několikapatrové trade houses, in which almost exclusively sell counterfeits.
pattlochovy cases but are different from the mandate of its mandantů is opposed to Chinese firms have received from the Trademark Office is officially use the right, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "bang mingpai" přidružená brand.
The word has been focused on the "bang dakuan."
The women are intended to catch the rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
"is this trade, we must fight," calls on pattloch.
"The brand is lost, the sole position will disappear, image damage is huge."
financial losses and the cost of the affected industries running into the millions, especially for expensive product demonstration.
According to company data for market research clsa of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and market, which is growing quickly.
výmazu dubious record in the register brands can, however, be a difficult and something that is.
management can stretch up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
pattloch tells about the cases when the Court rejected claims, because vytýkaný name became a reality of "market for a long time."
When the prosecution has the misfortune to plagiátorovi still pay, because the damage its brand in China, says pattloch.
Sometimes there is a law of the jungle.
The cases relate to the graphic elements.
In 2009 the Daimler lost legal dispute with producer construction machinery sany, enterprise, which recently took over the German manufacturer of pump betonovou mix putzmeister.
The Chinese may therefore still use emblem, similar to the stars of Mercedes.
The company geely, which bought Volvo, originally used modrobílé logo, which like BMW. dispute was settled, geely had to change the logo.
fashion goods manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with padělateli from Hong Kong and Singapore, who known krokodýla otočili in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any blame.
známkový office ctmo while accepting that there were shortcomings in 2010 because of the very small number of employees and space.
But last year, the supposedly "the work process back from emergency situation to normal."
For example, the number of management about the opposition fell 22 percent.
57 000 of these cases have been closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
still waiting for the office still 81 500 complaints handling.
to take something is expensive
As is often the case in China, they are imponující figures.
Last year was ctmo delivered more than 1.4 million applications for protection of the brand, which is nearly a third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China podesáté behind leads the list of new applications throughout the world.
This is also true for the number of all applicable of brands - there are a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011 was selected in charges 1.8 billion renminbi.
Simply put, this means that every check-in on average costs 1280 renminbi, or 160 euros.
start against this dispute is několikanásobek, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
This koncern for more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiátorovi.
The Germans made that would eliminate the illegal production of imitovaných car parts.
But padělatel secure the rights to track Freudenberg continue.
We ourselves failed to pick up on, because the surname in Germany cannot be protected, says hanno wentzler, chairman of the board of the company Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
známkový office ctmo then also rejected the order at the company.
In the other two instancích while Freudenberg domohl rights, but opponents in the dispute is further still.
We need to give the terrible care
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
wentzler has confidence that it would lead to a good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
It also says: "management is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
internal costs cannot be measured in the companies had to see even a hundred years old files to submit evidence.
Five years ago the company Freudenberg giving in vain offered "high šestimístnou amount in euros" for the purpose of settling the dispute.
"you can see what it means for us," says wentzler.
There is a risk that the danger from the Far East will hit Europe.
and when there are imitátoři ensure vulnerable brand.
A Chinese manufacturer, for example, I log in Germany the Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This area of the business koncern long ago gave up, yet managed to avert the registration.
"We need to be terrible care," says wentzler.
He and attorney pattloch advises German businesses, to be very careful in trade with China.
It is not enough to rely on international známková subscribe would rather have "all that is in any way to protect the rights of foreigners in China," says wentzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if the company Freudenberg of giving in the last act of the drama to the brand, then you will have to pay licensing fees for its own name, explains wentzler.
Or will we pushed in the disputed segment of the market.
World AIDS Day: dupání, singing, aid
in Heidelberg is trying to force imbongi - and in Swaziland are happy for parents who died of AIDS orphans.
The story link that exceeds more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, there is dupání: kovbojské high shoes, basketball shoes, female lodičky and men mokasíny are looking at trading tact and quickly find it.
jeden-dva-tři-čtyři.
then slowly vzedmou voices of singers - alt, Bas, tenor and soprán - are pushing mámí and mutually stíhají.
29letého conductor fiete hopfa almost points its of its textile shine when it votes with vláčně wild gestures.
It is Monday night in Chamber music Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg is trying to force imbongi new song.
It came on a zpěvaček and singers between 23 and 69 years ago, from female researchers human genetics after domovníka.
',' obani composition "is easy, every chorus voice has a different text and even, in a foreign language - zulu, which is 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
aid to self-help
UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, estimates that there are around 34 million people around the world who are infikováni HIV.
from this 23,5 million live in South Africa.
in Swaziland is 245 000 Euro-orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
For more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 orphans after parents who died of AIDS in the village of esitjeni found a play for Africa patrons in Germany.
70 of them attends school second degrees.
For 15 or 20 euros a month can take patronát.
guarantees to tuition fees, school uniform and one hot meal a day in gogo-centru.
imbongi means in the language of zulu "vypravěč stories" or "He who extols."
plynnou bantuštinou can say no one in the area, just sing.
For almost ten years nacvičuje College songs in this foreign soft speech, and sometimes it is also brings back where originally come from: South Africa.
In the distance the air 8 733 kilometers from Heidelberg is in northeast svazijského UK village esitjeni, which is dependent on mohutnosti German college votes.
Forty per cent of infikováno
about 2,000 people live there, some even in ordinary mud or slaměných huts and a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, as they succumbed to the HIV virus.
In esitjeni is seen in a small, the stůně the svazijsko: highest rate of infikovanosti HIV, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The male circumcision předkožky, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half the population does not accept.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland are wearing virus weakened immunity in itself is no rare that die in less than 30 years.
a College in this village common path for Africa in the spring of 2005, however, the imbongi saw many children on the streets, which was not only parental care, but absolutely everything: food, clothing, education.
without ukončeného school education are in a poor country has no chance.
Initially, this was still private use of individuals, which in a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him one hot meal a day.
Yet a year later was founded the group "and for Africa," which has since the millions of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
facts about sexually transmitted infections
which are the most sexually transmitted disease?
The bakteriálním SPI restricted syfilis, chlamydie and kapavka (gonorea).
often get the latest virus SPI, HIV, the human papilomaviry, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
muňky and svrab belongs to parazitárním SPI.
who belongs to the Group of the most affected?
syfilis and kapavka occur mainly among men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert kocha stems from the fact that at least four of the five all cases syfilidy, that have been reported in Germany, are transmitted sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults are sexually transmitted diseases, which are often chlamydiové infection trichomonády, kandidóza (blight), kapavka and human papilomaviry.
HIV is between heterosexuálními adults in our extended relatively little, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections is in this group.
In the case of minors, chlamydiové infections are significantly more often than for other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections on young people from 15 to 25 years.
For us, the case of minors often found human papilomaviry.
How to put the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases must be reported.
the number of infected syfilidou, according to the constitution, Robert kocha from 1697 disease in 2001, more than doubled to 3698 disease in 2011.
the number of new HIV infections has been shrinking since 2007.
The year 2011 was approximately 2 700 cases.
This is about one tenth of less than a year before.
The signs are pointing to sexual disease?
infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the mutilation, difficulties in urination, výtok, pain in podbřišku postulate or wart.
Often, however, don't cause any pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain nezpozorovány.
How is it possible to protect?
the use of condoms can reduce the risk of contamination, but do not offer 100% protection.
as the source of the infections may partly be transferred to sexually transmitted diseases of impurities and close physical contact.
So experts recommend, particularly in the case of frequent sexual partners, the regular rotation.
In the case of early diagnosis is possible cure most SPI and prevent the consequences later.
Thanks to the patronage dobročinným donations and, last but not least, honorářům, College earns zpíváním throughout Germany, to gather some money.
"In total, we have been in esitjeni sent roughly 200 000 euros," says President Group Annette lennartz.
money from Germany were in the village of zodwa dlamini, confident woman, which can impose.
care also to orphaned children find shelter for some of the grandmothers, for example.
gogo, as in the language of zulu says old women, are the backbone of the village.
Some of them have taken 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and look after the children produces every day in uniforms to school on time.
Children who already have no, go to the shelter to khanyisile, the lone woman, which is a as well as two kuchařky, which makes for more than 200 hungry children on a daily basis.
"and for Africa," by sewing school, put two kurníky and together with American health organisations dogs zařídilo that many people in the village have to do HIV test.
This is not granted. Although the disease is so clear across the country, all of it is silent.
The King of the 14 wives
"AIDS is absolutely taboo," says Annette lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
In fact, quite strange in the country, where the King officially maintains 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King mswati III, is known for his nemírným lifestyle.
polygamy instead of democracy.
The state approved by way of life is, among other things, also blamed on the fact that the HIV virus spread so quickly in recent decades.
But many of the migrant workers who virus roznesli around the country.
Annette lennartz says that the use of condoms are on every corner for free," but no one is used.
Culture is different - non-proprietary contact."
to support at least a bit of cultural exchange, travel the imbongi together again for two, three years after the South Africa and sings songs full of grief, militancy, confidence in the future and the confidence of many in the southern tip of the dark continent know even from the apartheid era.
The bus full of white people who sung songs in the language of blacks - this award brings not only the mood and joy, but also already vyloudilo tears for many wild border troops.
The road always leads to esitjeni where zpěváci visits children, over which they have patronát.
Although this vesničku hardly is on the map, in the valley of the river ezulweni is more than known.
"go to esitjeni, there is light," say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg, which is just as the crow flies 8733 kilometres to dupajícím zpěvákům in put into trial on bergheimer Straße, you see that light shines here.
messenger: NASA has to Merkuru ice
the messenger probe found evidence that it is on the planet Merkur ice.
ice receded could have tloušťku up to 20 metres.
The US National Aeronautics and kosmonautiku (NASA) proved the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Even if the closest to the sun, there is also zmrzlá water, to judge from the three studies, published on Thursday, the expert "science."
the messenger probe found evidence for that in the area of the planet, which is in permanent shadow, there is ice receded.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters and perhaps even up to 20 metres strong.
The water seems to come from komet or perhaps of asteroids that Merkuru hit.
Let us not give but find ice in connection with the existence of life on this planet, said leading scientists working on sondě messenger, Sean the Solomon.
the temperature of the Merkuru can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings, however, we can help to explain how the water and other basic elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.

one of the biggest and harshest images hubbleova teleskopu: vírová galaxy
The images spirálních galaxií will become real in its colour pieces of art.
the coverage, which published the European Southern Observatory, shows several thousand light years distant mlhovinu trifid in souhvězdí shooter.
The name trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, trojklanný), as dark lanes of dust are žhoucí heart this was porodnice into three parts.
In souhvězdí hadonoše astronomové vyfotografovali a space collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the wife of two splývajících galaxií and must inevitably be a crash.

Scientists believe that only created shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views into space: most telescopes
dalekohled allegedly invented in 1608 Hans lipperhey. before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical dalekohledů still zvětšovala - and views, which is mediated by, are still deeper.
The largest telescope in the world was for 30 years from 1947 to 1975, haleův teleskop Observatory palomar near San diega.
The mirror in this image should average five metres.
In the Arizona is large binocular telescope.

In the "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (network) - finding mimozemské intelligence - can help every owner of computers, which will give its computing power available.
look at pozorovatelnu European Southern Observatory (ACE) in the Chilean Andes.
There is a very large telescope - and honours to his name.
This dalekohled with a total of four mirrors can prosvítit central infrared spectrum.
The European extremely large dalekohled is also planned on the Chilean Observatory ace.
Its main mirror has a full 42 meters and složeno is to be almost 1000 mirror elements.
The images can be but first count in 2018.
two keckovy dalekohledy a live volcano on Hawaii investigated Mauna Kea in 2007 were considered to be the largest in the world.

The most important fotek from space gives us hubbleův space dalekohled.

The space teleskop Kepler currently missing from March 2009 to extrasolar planets - especially for those that are an inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that since the beginning of the mission was found 1235 candidate planets.
In the latest training are documented before the space teleskopu Kepler.
space dalekohled James webba (jwst) will begin in 2018 vystřelen into space on board the rockets ariane5.
The primary mirror space unpacked teleskopu has average 6.5 standards.
One of the tasks of teleskopu is to look for the light of the first stars and galaxií after the big bang.
Scientists are based on the fact that there is ice in the South Pole Merkuru.
For this, however, there are no reliable data, as messenger circling around the planet far closer to the North Pole.
radar measurements indicate that several decades is on Merkuru ice.
Thanks to sondě messenger, which was launched in 2004 and is the first that obíhá around Merkuru, scientists now have the certainty.

Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in schwarzwaldu.
But this is the ultimate South Azerbaijan is only a few kilometres away from the border with Iran.
living here kavkazská ethnic group talyšů on which this is too well known, moreover, that is perfectly Persian and ázerbájdžánsky and dožívá very high age.
The station is lerik.
This town honosí too monumental architecture of Soviet times, in the picturesque mountain landscape somehow appropriate.
tourists from Europe here nejezdí. The arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too difficult.
eight hours is needed in 323 kilometers, because the road is only jednoproudová.
fabulous wealth, for which the country's naftě in the Caspian Sea, here in the countryside still nedorazilo.
pilata fatulajeva (48), however, is convinced that lerik has to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May made famous the price eurovize - and next year we will have the festival of the oldest people in the world," says fatulajeva.
longevity is Director of the Museum, about a single in the world.
This is documented the lives of almost eight dozen talyšů from the area, who are over 100 years. fatulajeva shows black and white pictures.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years.
In the age of 136 years to a child.
But the controversial star of this museum is pastevec sheep şirali müslümov, which allegedly was 168 years.
Of course there is the birth certificate.
and given that nejstaršímu man with documents was 122 years, it seems müslümovův age extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area of 1805 and died in 1973," explains fatulajeva.
The man was said to be three times ženat and had 23 children in the age of 136, even a daughter.
nezmýlil so şirali müslümov at my age a few decades?
The letitých people in Central Asia, however, heard and Rembrandt Scholz, gerontolog constitution max plancka in rostocku.
"strikingly high age living in some areas of China, many people in Japan or in the valley Hunza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, extremely many very old men."
because of the lack of surfaces, however, cannot be to no scientific proof of age, especially when the absence of matriky.
Every day the glass rozpuštěného butter
But the fact is that people in the area around leriku live biblical age often strikingly.
There are currently 20 people, which are 100 years old.
So why are so many here in the South letitých people?
The guide Farid mugimzadeh this explains the special genes talyšů.
The Museum fatuljeva, on the other hand, believes that it is in the diet.
However, the fact that calorie diet talyšů who love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products and many of whom drank a glass a day rozpuštěného butter, is so healthy, from bromatologického point of view it is credible.
Or is it the way of life that keeps people young? In cengemiranu, tiny settlement near the city of lerik live rubaba mirzajeva.

If that is not reason to remain alive as long as possible
The term "human rights" in the constitution is missing
revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo have revealed a deep division of the country.
In discussing the future constitution based on Sharia law.
Egyptian President nešetřil patosem.
We need to create a transition.
"and for that we are able to do so, I am responsible, from people and from God," he said on state television.
his speech was intended to the whole nation, but Christian Copts, liberals, an enlightened Muslims and secular people.
They all still hopelessly rozhádaní in confused opposition, fear.
a fear of "God" on the state awarded the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed mursí almost omluvně told that temporarily limit the powers of the constitutional court and spread those their to "save the revolution."
But what it wants 61letý engineer, who has the title of Doctor of American universities in southern California really save, in that they do not have clear Egyptians and the world.
to be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
234 paragrafy that stohlavé constituent assembly with its majority of Islamists quickly approved in patnáctihodinovém night marathon, partly cause concern.
As in past constitutions, it is said that the jurisdiction in this proposal is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does the "principle"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that Islamists this unclear wording and its associated právnický free space use for stricter interpretation of šaríi.
At the very least, it highlights the newly added section: in all matters relating to šaríi, it is necessary to deal with university al-azhar, which is the most important Islamic institutions in the country with a great impact on the whole of the Sunni Islam.
It may not, but may mean that klérus will be to supervise the legislations, which justice has de facto prison clear-headedness.
In the draft constitution is many things interpretation
Also, the problem is that it has to be maintained civil jurisdiction of military courts.
These courts served as Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship was in military custody until 11 000 civilians.
As stated in the proposal, the state should also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family and support its morality and values."
It is legally worded so vaguely that it through this section of the institutions of the state can even control the content of the film art and literature.
In plain language, it does not mean anything other than censorship.
After all, no section in writing does not draw explicit equality between men and women.
In another section prohibits shaming or to defame the prophet Mohammed and his envoy.
What remains unclear is the defamation of religions and how it will be prosecuted.
as dubious causes the wording that is prohibited "insulting people."
Only in this case the caricature of President or a joke at the expense of rights experts?
a matter of interpretation, as much more in this proposal, which mursí will present to sign and, in their words," very soon "to present them to the popular vote.
"The revolution is back"
For several weeks, an opposition against the majority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people in unusual svornosti gathers on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and promised to destroy the Constitutional Charter, even before paying.
"the revolution is back and we will win," said hamdín sabbáhí, which placed the third place in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft constitution is "to the dustbin of history."
through the services of short Twitter reports accused being more towards mursího, that they want a "coup against democracy."
"If a referendum will go to his palace and svrhneme it," said a member of the opposition Yasir said.
"We are not yet tired of the blood of our brethren is still not punished," cited the Egyptian opposition media policy Khaled, Ali.
Several judges announced that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would become neplatným.
"the Koran is our Constitution"
well organised by the Muslim Brotherhood declared vzdorodemonstraci, but not of caution in Tahrir Square, but after the mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before káhirskou University.
attended many zahalených women and supporters of the Salafis, who called: "people are demanding the application of God's law."
called mursího: "vyčisti country!" and ubezpečovali: "the Koran is our constitution."
The battle for sovereignty over a symbolic Square Tahrir Square on which it began, would probably trigger a similar state of civil war.
This mursího, clearly did not want to risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that supporters and opponents of the draft constitution loudly and clearly expressed.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box, which direction the country has to go.
For a majority in favour of the proposal is seen by Islamists.
"the word 'human rights', there is not even one"
forced the constitutional dispute that should, in fact, to continue until February and integrate all the social forces ročiluje háfize Abu sa 'du.
osmačtyřicetiletý human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian organisation for human rights (eohr) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood, when they were under Mubarak in prison or stood before a court of law.
not because they shared their ideology, but because of it, human rights are indivisible.
For that, he was beaten by convicted and imprisoned.
"and in the new constitution now are not the words of 'human rights' not once," complains in an interview for "Welt that am on Sunday."
mursího extension of power to all three components of power in the state has forced the lawyer to resign.
These measures are scandalous crime against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"instead of the President of civil society, effectively abolished it," complains the sa 'da.
But democracy cannot work without civil society organisations.
sa 'da feel abandoned by the international community, which is the ideological factions struggle to Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
He could easily backfire.
demonstrant in Tahrir Square warns: "You created the monster, which you cannot control."
Norwegian rakfisk: most páchnoucí fish in the world?
five million people living in Norway has one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to local apetitem for extremely páchnoucí fish?
take a few přezrálých cheese.
ask is mid-way through the piles of dirty and wet football equipment.
Let this week lie.
So you get a sense of the paralyzing stench rakfisku, one of the largest of delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
there is snow, spectacular views - and the pervasive stench hangs in the air.
rakfisk is nasolený pstruh kvašený in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want to fish páchla.
As stmívá and beginning to be cold, the Norwegians are here in Fagernes meet at the festival of this, how best to say it, nejpodmanivějšímu eat.
"dreaming is raw and then zapijete full aquavitu," says havard halvarsen, local professional fireman, but also the so-called "rakfisk general" who is responsible for the festival.
all around us, people eat the small fish and zapíjejí is large quantities of alcohol.
"some people would rather have aquavit than rakfisk," says havard.
drink can trump the stench.
a few pieces I will.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it is not so bad - it is a bit by bit sushi, which was on a long journey by bus.
rakfisk is a product of a very different time, when it was in Norway, poverty, and because there were still fridge, fish in the autumn namáčely to vzduchotěsných casks with water and salts.
then in the middle of winter, when they were well zkvašené, vytáhly and snědly senses - undoubtedly otupily alcohol.
a mere one generation were thousands of norů forced to leave their country and seek work, with the majority of emigrated to the United States.
At the moment, the rapidly growing population - more than 13% are immigrants přilákaní a great deal of work, high earnings and a system of care.
the Swedish people, old rival, which was not long ago much richer than Norway, flowing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, essential, even if relatively zapáchající part of Norway's past.
Among the more expensive dishes on the market.
Even when everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or sandwich you come to 9 pounds ($14) a head.
Norway in worldwide reports often do not - and it seems that most of the people it serves.
The name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist extremists, who last year shot 77 men, women and children, people here still mention still letting in hardly.
Instead, the shooting an "event of 22 July."
the Norwegians can hardly believe that, in their peaceful country one of them was able to such brutality and murder.
for the wealth of Norway is the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries in the early 1970s of the twentieth century.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says in the plates with uleželým rakfiskem our waitress gives Anna, which, with its long blond hair and a blue eyes is a prototype nordického well-being.
We are, as you say, thoughtful people.
Her English, as well as the majority of English people, it is absolutely impeccable.
nepředvádíme, do not like the pomp.
Norway are very careful with its oil wealth - in addition to the small percentage of most of the money is invested in a special fund, to be used for future generations of this sector.
When everyone else in the years leading to the global financial collapse threw money that should not, the Norwegians have šňůrky at its měšci firmly utažené.
"as long as we can of skiing in the winter and in the summer to go on trips, we are happy," says Anna.
"and eat rakfisk," adds with bezstarostným smíchem.
I stand in the snow in front of something to eat - rakfisku I have had enough.
such losí Burger is certainly something different and it is beautifully šťavnatý.
But the evening is zapáchající fish again here.
the hotel, in which I live, is one of the many places where served rakfisk for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather the most demanding for a sense of the fish.
There are combined with living TV transfer, in which the moderator with motýlkem surrounded by plate with rakfiskem.
It is like a vocal competition.
"what you have to score for the best fish up there in the mountains, thore-juergene?"
"This is our scoring havarde."
strong Applause and laughter.
from the chair falling man, perhaps zmožený aquavitem.
Or perhaps fumes from all of those fish.
Enrique Pen nieto from Mexico has a difficult start
As the incoming Mexican President Enrique Pen nieto prepares to take office, looks will grant from the BBC to the challenges we face, and the mixed expectations of their fellow citizens.
the airport in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
in a city that is ucpané even in the best of times, have been vztyčeny steel to closing a few key routes into the city and causing chaos on the roads.
However, it could not prevent dojíždějícím to get to work, but to prevent the protesters in access to Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pen nieto receives presidential šerpu and take over the leadership of the nation.
face a daunting task.
Mexico in the time period of office of the outgoing Felipe calderona led well economically, the country is in the grip of the drug war, which has an estimated 60 000 lives take victim in six years.
"My Government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people in the reduction of violence," said the President of Pen nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office at the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before the potřásl hands with US President, received the President of Pen nieta political experience as the Governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views are different on the new leader in his old home, lidnatém and large state surrounding the city.
a man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo on him back in good.
The citizens of him to the development of tourism in the and building infrastructure.
In the city you can now reach for one of the new motorways, which left Pen nieto to build these highways are a huge improvement over děravým and hrbolatým roads that have been before.
boards with on his behalf also hangs on the walls of the modern sports centre and an imposing an interactive museum with themes of climate change.
"We expect that will bring real and lasting change," says friend and political ally of Gabriel olvera Hernandez, a member of the State President of Pen nieta institutionalised revolution Party (PRI).
particularly interesting hope and real change in terms of security and the economy, that our country so desperately needs.
After of uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI party vytlačena vicentem foxem.
a member of the olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace pinos within the Party from enriqua Pen nieta many expected.
and to the opposition that defines the new President as a man without significant content.
This one is very straightforward, very taken with excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman who and, above all, is the man who can listen to.
But, on the other hand, this is not the impression of the state, which has many people from its former governor.
In nezahualcoyotlu, also known as Ciudad neza, cannot be the contrast with dlážděnými streets of Valle del Bravo clearer.
zastrčený under the motorway nadjezdy in much of the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
and the problems in the municipalities are also sustained and urban.
At the beginning of this year, the army was called to help the apparent drug gangs operating out in the neighborhoods, violence against women is particularly painful.
Only in the last two years have been on pustých places alongside the landfill waste pohozeny body dozen murdered women.
At a time when the pen nieto governor, more than 1,000 women have been murdered in the state of Mexico, which is much more than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - the site, which is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
In the best case, critics Pen nieta say that during his time in office has failed to adequately tackle the problem head on women's murders.
and his leadership in the worse case accuse of escapism.
In betonovém House, typical for zchátralou district, me irinea buendia shows photos of his dead daughter Marian luny and by crying.
According to the official version of a Mariana suicide in 2010.
her family, however, believe that it killed her partner.
"When I arrived in the House, it looked as if the body be washed," recalls Mrs buendia.
There were signs of the strikes and has already started posmrtná rigidities.
as her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the image on the wall right next to the cross, which is a single word: "justice."
However, this is, as the family says, is exactly what they were was denied the.
State authorities acted to me, as if I was an old drbna, potížistka and kňouralka.
They want you to simply accept what they say, and stay silent.
"but it cannot be right that there have been so many errors and omissions," he says.
\ xC5 erpa, which the President of Pen nieto on Saturday will receive is accompanied by a great responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families affected by violent crime in Mexico and the new President has promised that during his time in office will be his priority.
"I hope that the President will be the same as the governor," says in the Valle del Bravo Member of the PRI olvera.
But this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad neza fear most.

military prosecutor maj. ashden Fein in křížovém interrogation vojína manninga in preliminary hearing in ft. maede in marylandu argued that records weekly visits, which manning had with officers troops during the nine months of detention in quanticu in Virginia, do not show any complaints about poor treatment.
křížový interrogation, which occurred during the hearing by the case to reject the proposal of defence led by against manningovi because of rough treatment at the time of the ties, which itself is sufficient punishment, took place the day after manning testify about that in the context of the thought of suicide.

The material was then published online at WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never nepotvrdila that manning was the source of its information.
at Friday's hearing has been military prosecutor Fein together with manningem form that officers fill after meeting with manningem in detention prison in quanticu, where he was held from July 2010 to April 2011, with increased security regime.
officers manningovi regarded questions and seen his answers.
When it Fein on Friday on the form ask manning admitted that the treatment by their strážných judge as "excellent" and the overall treatment evaluated in facilities as "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaints about poor treatment, even when the officers manninga directly asked how it is treated, Fein said.
manning replied that concerns about various issues expressed orally and that officers who visited him, talked with him on these concerns and have suggested that these problems will deal with them, but not seen.
"zapsali" no problems "(after discussed concerns), and not necessarily mean that I have not mentioned on them," said manning.

manning replied that in the course of this meeting was his intention to reduce the "prevention of injury."
The army said that for him the restrictive regime (one degree of under supervision regime because of suicide) used for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted to know that I am in order of guards in custody and that I wanted to abolish this regime of injury prevention... so I can enjoy the increased quality of life, as seen here," said manning.

He said that in Kuwait has considered suicide and one there because of the heat omdlel.
He said that he was not allowed to know what will be in it and what is happening in the rest of the world, it was very depressing.
"My world is smrskl only to base arifdžán a cage," he said in the Thursday manning.
I thought that a cage I die.
manning said that, following the arrival in quantica spent most days (at least 21 hours, but often for more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any society.
manning said that he had been allowed only one mattress, a blanket nazouváky, some clothing and glasses.
He said that he had tried to go, because sleeping or just lying against the legislation in the course of the day.
manning said that always slept with light from the outside in the eyes of the cell.
He said that if the watch could not see his face when the night turned on the other hand, gave him and had to turn back.
manningův legal representatives filed a formal complaint to the treatment of vojínem manningem in January 2011.
manning was in April 2011 přeřazen in a military prison in Fort leavenworth in kansasu.
On Friday, judge manninga also asked about the allegations, which raised in Thursday's testimony, on the fact that after he was forced to sleep one night in his cell in quanticu naked, was also forced to stand naked before the guardians and other spoluvězni counting in the morning.
manning had in counting that he was not allowed to cover its přikrývkou.
In Friday's interrogation provedeném female judge manning said that the warrant their guards concluded that a blanket, which could cover up to, but admitted that he ordered no one not to postpone it.
On Thursday manning terminated, that the previous night was forced to sleep naked, because to důstojníkovi to show that it is not dangerous.

Among the accusations levelled against manningovi include aiding the enemy, illegal of the intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national security and theft of public property or records.
If the accused in all the points can be sentenced to life imprisonment.
My crisis mexicko-americké identity
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities that are there.
Mexicans tend to blame those that have left; they are hard times, says.
navarrette says that Mexican Americans are lapeni between two worlds.
On the last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely prodral mob and I arrived in the area for the agenda of immigrants, where I encountered a problem.
Darts showed to one of the two fronts: one for "mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there a few seconds, and I did not know where I have to go.
I grew up in central California and the life I was called "mexičanem."
This is the same as the ethnic when my friends in Boston called "Irish" and my friends in New York call themselves as "Italy."
So later I ended up in the "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
and in the home of my Grandpapa was not necessary to use shortcuts.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to manage both sides of the conversation in that language.
I have, however, vocabulary rodilého speaker and I cannot get rid of us přízvuku.
So I pulled out my American passport and put in front of "extranjeros."
I thought about the time when this week the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pen nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
on the agenda were the issues that probírají, when the leaders of the two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pen nieto I also talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the same likelihood that Mexicans will remain in Mexico, as they travel to the United States.
wants to join with the United States and Canada and the European Union to create similar trade bloc in North America.
and pen nieto promised that will continue in Mexico's war against the drug cartels, although did not provide any details.
Mexico is a complicated relationship with the United States and full of unpleasant feeling.
Most Americans probably never nepomyslela to the fact that the United States invaded in 1848 Mexico and forced its leader under the threat of weapons to rewrite the half of Mexico's territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans, who thinks of centuries, not minutes, comments are ubiquitous.
So one minute after the United States representative says something a little critical of Mexico, you hear in the press and among the elite complaints about how Americans are in the sovereignty of its neighbour.
and children montezumy moving on the path.
And yet, the relationship is the real challenge for Mexico to more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
you want to talk about the hostile feelings?
These are a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people of that country offers opportunities, and others that do not.
The only reason why so many people with Mexican roots live in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio, is that at some point our family tree a person, perhaps the parent or prarodič, which was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
and more often than it seemed to fit the profile of the person - the location of the weak, the education of the poor village, etc.
We are their children and we are loyal to them.
not against Mexico.
And now we are living the American dream, go to good schools and have a good job, we can never forget the fact that we are living the American dream, not Mexico.
our identity can sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It is to the United States.
and we are aware that many among this elite Mexicans belonging to the ruling class us dislike.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and look at us as the race, which is not enough to be Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
our existence is, in their view, only about the failure.
If our families in Mexico neselhaly, so it never neopustily.
and we are now nenalézali imprisoned for hedvábnou curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still lost BC).
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, as well as in childhood legally přicestovala reminds me of the tension that exists between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the United States, because the Mexicans more understand who they are, and Mexican Americans resent it.
Although it is občankou the United States sees itself as part of the two countries.
and at the same time, many Mexican Americans, that I know feel as part of either.
love listening to the Mexican groups tigres del Norte, but also Bruce springsteena.
you get the best of both countries, but you don't have the roots in either.
In Mexico view us as Americans.
and we have considered the Mexicans in the United States.
and to complicate relations with some of its leaders want to and some of the intelligence, as I learned during his trip, reconnect with diasporou.
They want to Mexican Americans work for Mexico as "provisional ambasadoři" and they were the Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American citizens, how great it is to visit the country, and push for political leaders to forge relations with Mexico.
No.
This is not so.
too many hostile feeling.
and thanks to income inequality and a widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not certain that this is a great country.
I have a feeling that it is up to you, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States to act with Mexico before one and a half century and must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel indignation for the way in which it was discussed with members of their family in considerably closer to the past.
Hmmm.
We may be more "Mexicans" than I thought.
The old battles, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could still be uncertain basis for peace.
can ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such case was in vain.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses as to who started, many buildings have been changed in the rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis. and, for the first time the rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, Israel's capital, and in the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even if it appears that Israelis and Palestinians are stranded in their ancient conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has changed the old ways and the Palestinians and the Israelis, whether they like it or not, are zachyceni in nastalém chaos in the region.
Perhaps this will mean that their fight will be even krvavější than ever before.
However, there are reasons to think that this could break their deadly stalemate.
The war, which is neither vyhraná or a lost.
At first glance, it seems that, at present, there are many reasons for optimizmu.
Even if a cease-fire reached 21 November vydrželo fight this week strengthened hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that ruled Gaza since 2007, will argue that forced the Israelis to retreat, while Gaza has suffered defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and rate of 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the poorest global and the most populous parts of the planet, with Israel nor Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas gaining influence in the West Bank, which is currently managed by the Palestine, his are ardent rivals from Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may very well decide that time is on their side.
Islamists across the Arab world have more influence, so Hamas won the rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, znovuvzkříšená regional power, which once was the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has added to the Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
cheering people from Hamas say that Islamic Crescent spans around Israel, in the north of Lebanon, where a party/militia Hezbollah through Syria, where rebels, who are increasingly drawn to islamizmu can unseat Bashar al-Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies of the king.
and, above all, on the southern end of Israel's changed the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Mohammad mursího in Egypt, by far the most populous and the Arab countries, the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, secular tyrant, who ruled for 30 years until its collapse in Egypt in 2011, not time on Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is bratrancem Hamas and its leaders are more ovlivnitelní public opinion.
In the future the Hamas diplomacy can appear as a player, which cannot be ruled out Israel or America.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will opposite conclusions.
In military terminology was Hamas stored back into boxes.
Israel's anti-missile system iron kopule proved their worth and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
the Israelis can sleep better - for the moment.
In diplomatic language is America, unfailing as always, many European countries also vinyl Hamas from the start of the latest round of violence.
and in particular - Israel to prosper, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who has mostly ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets from Gaza since 2004 killed around 30 Israelis, was relatively calm in Israel from the suicide bomb bombers, in part thanks to the wall, which is the Palestinian state in the West Bank, the main part of what may be the one, and protects the Jewish settlements, which are growing despite its protiprávnost against international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party at the start of the campaign in the elections held on 22 January merged with even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman, is in a good position.
Why by those proradné Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If it really ruled in the West Bank, neodpalovali rockets, as did their compatriots in Gaza?
It is better if we keep them for the walls and praštíme is when vystrčí heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will have won, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
Although the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries have Israel too in love, their main priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israeli defence spending is higher than spending all his four Arab neighbours together.
the launch of a new war with local superpower will hardly help the new Arab remember to heal him its economy.
The fact that President mursí worked with President Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire is a good sign and can be the beginning of something new.
also the Israelis should look at the situation in the long term.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, a denial of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination is the keg, which must one day burst in areas occupied by Israel - as well as the bus, which exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
at the time of the repression of democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics of the situation even worse, as the Arab population is growing.
The bloody attacks against Gaza taking place every few years in order to drive Hamas will increasingly choose diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what think reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world and these newspapers: two States, when Israel went territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little chance that the cease-fire will provide pressures from the outside at least a little more influence to push this issue.
Egypt, which together with Turkey and Qatar have to stop the supply of arms to Gaza, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with the exchange of parts of the country and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside must also push for the agreement between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the immediate offer virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations.
President Obama also has its share of on how to get Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term zanedbal presentation of its own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, seems to be equally zdráhavý in its entry in the process.
This is woefully short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws came into force in Australia means cigaretových packaging
The nevzhledných green boxes, which are the same for all tobacco brands, are depicted warning for smokers and sick of the body.
The arrival of Australian laws in force means packaging of tobacco and cigarettes, the first of its kind in the world, and logos and colors brands replaced general olivově green krabičkami with ohavnými images of parts of the body and the depiction of children and newborn onemocnělých as a result of their parents' smoking.
In addition to the various health warnings and pictures are Povinně since Saturday, the only difference between krabičkami name brands, which are printed in the small print.
This is a strict regime in the world on the packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government claims that the aim is to discourage young people from smoking by the habit of his appeal.
relying on studies that show that if people start smoking by the age of 26 years, is 99% chance that never start smoking.
"for very young children, you can see that the tobacco companies trying to understand the message that they, along with their product to sell," says federal health minister tanya plibersek and CITES studies that show, for example, that the permanent děti link crown logo with the idea to be a Princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering the introduction of similar steps.
The tobacco industry lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
tobacco companies claimed that the law will increase trading on the black market, which will lead to cheaper and dostupnějším cigaretám.
"with this legislation will be serious unintentionally consequences," says Scott McIntyre of the society of British American Tobacco Australia.
counterfeiters from China and Indonesia přivezou much more of these products, which will be sold on the streets of Australia.
Another claim that laws have increased their shops.
Sandra la from society zico import Pty Ltd, small family businesses, said that the demand on the cigaretové packaging of silicone used to shelter nechutných boxes, two months ago, when Britain's society of British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have lost their appeal on the laws to Australia's Supreme Court, increased from almost zero sales.
ha said that society zico sold almost 6 000 units wholesale dealers and expects new supplies.
Trade is good for us.
Experts cite the popularity of social media as a possible setback for the demographic groups plan to focus on that.
After a number of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events and requiring a majority of retailers to cigarettes from direct view of tobacco marketing moved online.
Australia banned Internet advertising, local companies and websites, but it cannot restrict foreign sites.
"If you are marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you have only this small space is for you to promote your products online space insurmountable place in which you want to be," says becky Freeman, research in the area of public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs Freeman recorded an increase in the brands on social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, of "average honzou."

In the world of the Internet is not so bad to be znuděný
The last day díkuvzdání I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport, when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another aircraft.
So we had a lot of time to think about the boredom.
I am not going to lie.
For half a day at the airport for the next years is much pesky, despite the dispersion of books, magazines and iphonem (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development increasingly come with praise nudění.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) is sometimes boring.
This forces the brain to go to interesting directions, which can promote creativity.
and given that most of us today is constantly connected to any screen, we do not have the chance to enjoy the ennui.
So we should support the ennui?
Yes.
and no.
But I will come back to that.
Firstly, as well as many people I assumed that boring is a relatively new phenomenon that has happened with the arrival of more free time.
But as Peter says toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history in the Canadian university in Calgary, who is the author of the book boredom boredom: a lively history (history) (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, a long history is boring," he said.
The walls in pompejích Latin inscription was found on boredom, coming from the first century AD.
And then there is also the question of how we define ennui.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed many different ways, said John D. eastwood, a professor of psychology at York University in ontariu in Canada.
After watching the research literature and transfer ideas the Group of about 100 people Professor eastwood and his colleagues defined ennui as experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to."
boring from apathy distinguishes this, that person is not involved in anything, but I would be.
He says that there is no urge to do something for the apathy.
He says that at the heart of boredom is the attention "of the process, the bad mood and a sense of slowly ubíhajícího time."
boring can remind a lot of depression.
But Professor eastwood said that while the relationship may have have nudící people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed, see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that nudíme when we only have problems with concentration.
In his study "the unengaged mind: defining boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal caused by psychological science, Professor eastwood and his colleagues have pointed to an earlier experiment, in which participants listened to the tape, on which a person read an article from the magazine.
Some groups learned first hand loud and unrelated television programme in a side room, others have heard it so quietly that it barely noticed, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard a television programme silent hlásili greater ennui, than the other two groups - had difficulties in concentration, but were not sure why and to these difficulties boredom.
When you are trying to focus on the difficult or poutavý task of attention can lead to boredom, said mark J. fenske, professor of Neurosciences at the University of guelph in ontariu and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do something nudného," such as a bad components on the line, the distraction of music can help with this, keep you busy."
In fact, he said, we now know that kroucení and čmárání, who are often seen as a sign of boredom, may actually help nudou fight and keep people physically be more alert.
"research shows that children who is allowed vrtět, learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit in peace," said Professor fenske.
We have all experienced some ennui - my flight delays, hučící speaker, especially a lengthy film.
But some individuals are more likely to get bored than others.
The scientists developed in the 1980s to help with the measurement of boredom "scale for susceptibility to nudění" (boredom proneness scale).
The scale covers issues such as: "many of the things that I have to do is repeated and monotónních, 'and' I have so much interest that do not have the time to do them all.."
With these stupnic scientists have found that boys tend to get bored with more often than girls, said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need for more and different external stimulus.
However, teenagers are generally indifferent.
In 1991 he larson, professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which seven to eight times a day contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents.
found that 32 per cent of teenage said that nudili in school and in dělání domestic tasks, while 23 percent said that nudili when not in school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said that the nudili.
Professor larson said that he did not know whether the percentage of boredom was now, 21 years later, more or less.
But he said that he knows that "growing up is the time for ennui," which is largely due to the fact that children and young people is not because of a lot of control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "is boring for you good?."
As the research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form can lead people to undergo absurd physical risks, played a gambling or abused the addictive substances as a way to reduce it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the link between nudou and creativity, said Professor vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"boring is the way the brain, to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain is always the most appropriate thing you should do.
If nudíte and use this energy to play on the guitar and cooking, you will be pleased to do.
However, if you watch TV, you will do the joy, not just for a moment in the long term.
So if your child nudí and you give him the iPad, it will not be bored, but nenaučí to take itself or of controlling, said Professor fenske.
"This independent governance is passed on from one situation to the other," said the professor.
your child is nenaučí only to take itself, but will be more self-control in other areas.
I do not think that we really want to celebrate ennui.
But even against it we should not be too critical.
Our aim should rather be feel comfortable when we from the reach of drnčení activities and technology.
Professor eastwood agreed.
"We are accusing it of needs more bored with, but boring is painful, restless, the desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are actually looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy free time.
"in the environment in which we are constantly přestimulovaní," he said, "it is difficult to find ways to take when the noise turned off."
in Colorado, there is no manual on the new law on marihuaně
devatenáctiletý Anthony orozco, a student at the vocational school and higher player from south-eastern colorada, faces charges of criminal offences for what will soon be legal in the state - for possession of several grams of marijuana and cigar, which used for smoking it.
Mr orozco said that one September day he went with a few pals in lamaru, on the plains near the border with kansasem, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found the cannabis in the car, it was Mr orozco issued subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment to drug use - petty, for which is fine for every $100 - and he was established for the Court.
"We acted as the criminals," said Mr orozco.
But it is a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks after coloradském vote on the legalization of small quantities of marijuana for recreational use is the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases on the ground rather than on the right.
hundreds of cases of offences for possession of marijuana has been here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures, abolished.
The police department to stop blaming the adults at the age of 21 years and older for possession of a small amount of which is legally allowed, after the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the most conservative districts colorada said that will continue with existing cases involving marijuana, and still blame people for possession.
At the same time, a number of cities from the suburbs denveru towards Western mountains is voting to prevent the opening of the new state licencovaných stores marihuanou in their communities.
"this matter is developing so fast that I do not know what will happen next," said Daniel J. oates, the chief of police in the town of Aurora, East of denveru.
The heads of the drbou and regulators in Washington State.
for instructions on how to set up a system of licenses for cultivation, production, distribution and sale of all of the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether for better or for worse, is the first before the majority of states in the regulation of marijuana for medical use, first of all, and now the holiday.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Council for licensing to sell alcohol the state of Washington.
But as Mr Smith acknowledged, no place or system cannot do more than suggest what might work.
"There is no real precedent under which we could manage," he said.
The Washington law, the so-called i-502, is to take effect on December 6, which also leaves the vacuum, during which will still not be a state licensing system, but legal possession of yes.
and there are complex mechanical issues that must be resolved during this time, for example, how to balance state directive on "appropriate" access to a licensed marihuaně with its ban on trade with konopím in 330 metres away from schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centres.
"There will be more difficult to place the licensed trade with konopím than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the center for legal cannabis, recently based research group.
21 November sent police chief of oates e-mail its officers from the town of Aurora, in which they announced that the prosecutor will prosecute offences for possession of a small amount of marijuana for each citizen 21 years old and that the police "with immediate effect" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief of oates said that the police will promote urban laws regulating medical marijuana growers and that will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
in the district of weld in northern Colorado is a district prosecutor Ken buck stricter view.
After the vote, said that his office will continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to push users to seek treatment.
currently faces charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, 119 people, even though many of them are facing other charges.
"Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences, which was crimes at a time when they occurred," said Mr buck in its statement.
The response was complicated in places like rural district Mesa, where voters rejected marihuanovou initiative.
police in Grand junction, the city district, already adults blame for possession of a small amount.
district prosecutor, Pete hautzinger, supports this decision, but also decided to nezamítnout all the cases of possession.
"I do not think that I am losing my continuing my time until the change in law enforcement," he said.
Although 55 percent plains voters support the measures, bringing recreational marijuana into the arms of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
and contradictory response across the state revealed with regard to this great state green experiment deep ambivalence among local officials.
for district prosecutors "cultural barriers," said Sean mcallister, a lawyer from denveru, who represents accused of possession of marijuana, and local spokesman for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"the prosecution of people spent so much of his life, that they still cannot really accept that this is legal," he said.
As the first states to build a small amount of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington State on track national test cases for the legalisation of drugs.
advocates and state authorities are planning a new threshold for regularised sales and also anxious ahead of the guidelines from the federal government, which is still in the plan as the sale and cultivation of marijuana for federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana, hoping that the justice ministry complies.
Despite several arrests shop clerks marijuana for medical purposes and patients who use it, which have attracted attention, has most of the federal government deals with medical marihuanou in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States in the operation.
While protidrogoví agents will probably not vyrážet door to zachytili a small bag with drogou, it is likely that they will revolt allowing state regulated shops with recreational marihuanou permitted new laws, said Kevin A. sabet, a former adviser on drugs policy of the Obama administration.
several plains cities have the federal authorities.
The day before the election, some local governments have approved a moratorium on any new shops with marihuanou, although it will still take about a year before it can open any trade.
Last week the city montrose in the West of the State proposed six-month ban and it is likely that comes into force next week.
"We do not want to find themselves in a situation where someone go down a license and then we will have a federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
our Community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at this as voted for the Community, compared to what the state voted.
There is a number of questions.
petronella Wyatt: 'I was forced to leave Oxford, because I am a conservative."
Only today's university students are being attacked for their views.
I, that I would sometimes nesnila to study at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother studied at the university, to which I thought, that is the world's largest based knowledge, modern ovíněné Greek symposium motivating two pillars of civilisation, free thinking and tolerance.
And yet I am at the end of the 1980s in the two weeks after the worcester College, where I wanted to study history, sbalila trunks and vřítila I in the first scandal of his life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The evening standard said that I pay this because I had objections to milování students in another room.
The writer A. N. Wilson rozverně said that I left, because I was forced to drink from otlučených hrnků.
The truth was less humorous.
utekla I.
Yes, utekla I, because I was the subject of systematic harassment and intimidation.
not because of his somewhat bizarre name or the fact that I came from private schools.
I was persecuted for one reason only and perceived in this cradle of the Enlightenment was as bigotní and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher's senior adviser and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You can ask why this vytahuji until now.
simply because the latest reports suggest that a new generation of students are suffering from this kind of persecution from the centre right.
institutionalized and growing hatred against conservative students at Oxford, is so great that last week the these students domáhala equal protection of equal rights, they are gay men, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Members of the younger years (jcr) on Corpus Christi College says that because of their political views are "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and they made clear that they are not welcome."
They are asking for a position in the university Committee on equal opportunities, which would ensure that their views can communicate freely.
Their situation has it helped even the recent documentary the BBC Television is called Wonderland: young, bright and on the right (a tale of the country: young, smart and right-wing) on student political events, which the Conservatives described as podivíny and neonacisty.
In the agenda was presented a graduate Joe Cooke, the former President of the Oxford University in Association (Oxford University conservative Association - ouca), which his rolls-roycem was oblečený in a silver suit and should stick to the silver head.
The other high school students say that the conservative is with them because of the introduction of higher tuition fees are treated as "scapegoats."
a 20-year-old Luke black, Vice President of the University of Nottingham in Association (conservative association nottinghamské University), the newspaper said Sunday that "leftist influence is growing at universities.
people think that we as bullingdon Club without met with us at all."
jednadvacetiletý history student at Corpus Christi Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says that such a climate is "uncomfortable," while devatenáctiletá elected President ouca Stephanie cherill says that, in the approach of jcr towards people from the centre right has worsened.
"This is a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual debate, as well as for the welfare of Members," he says.
During his first few weeks in Oxford, I was a member of a minority.
I took in September 1986, 18letá and crippling way shy.
hatred of the Conservative Party was nejhorečnatější.
The year before University voted to reject the honest title former studentce Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
from the atmosphere would be stalinisté chvěli concerns.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students stýkají among themselves and with professors, I received ochutnat wormwood, which should come.
I discovered that not only professors tacitly approve challenges conservative pupils, but happily, it also participates.
The timber obložených poslucháren was has been brought policy mining strikes, privatization, and the government's resistance to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa.
My first lecture about the English translation of the French text from the 18th century and I was not prepared for what followed.
"slečno Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now the late), "přeložte please first paragraph."
It was me fast enough.
Professor Pitt, a small man with a face as dortové the dough, was a lot of žlučovitý.
"thatcherovci refuse to learn French, or are simply stupid?" he asked.
other students hihňali.
in the eye to me draly tears.
"I suggest you take some basic lessons of the French in their free time, so if you are not too engaged social issues," zavrčel Professor Pitt.
zdrcená I returned to their room.
at the dinner in the school I sat alone, when I ucítila light poklepání on the back.
It was the second year student on behalf of James, which is presented as a member of the ouca.
"I know who you are," said kindly.
Unfortunately, this is it.
Anyone who is suspected of conservatism is the target.
For me this is bad enough, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be even worse for you.
most conservative prváků pretends that they are labouristi.
later in the local Bar, I tried to pretend the cowardice.
I have insisted on the fact that I do not agree with everything the Thatcher said.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
One of the first year of this philosophy, politics and economics, which (what irony) went to the Eton, said: "You're the daughter of fascist pig."
You are infected.
other students with him notovali.
I was a perverse.
"as the Conservatives love?" asked one.
mlátí one another, right?
I felt, as gay people have to feel a liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Sometimes, I could lead a normal life in Oxford?
I would be forced to meet with like-minded people just after dusk,?
I had to change in labouristu and suppress their natural tendency?
three years before me developed as očistec ignoring and isolation.
The only openly conservative Professor was Norman stone, a professor of modern history, which sídlil at my school.
was nenáviděn not only for being conservative, but also for the fact that it is Margaret Thatcher for foreign policy adviser and one of those who write speeches.
almost there was not.
Instead of hated for its provinčnost and small-mindedness and for his recourse to marxisticko-deterministickému view of history.
Professor came to the place in 1997 bilkentské University in Turkish Ankara.
"you will not be happy here," he told me.
I started to from Oxford to their parents' house in London, hledajíc refuge for their nezaujatých Metropolitan friends and family.
My father said that Oxford I hate and why.
could not believe.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940 "s were accepted all political views.
"But after all, this is the best place in the world," said pateticky.
This would not do, not in the city of snové mood.
Even my Communist friends should always perfect ways.
his zvlhlé eyes zasmušily.
try it once.
I am sure that this is a joke.
zlomilo me heart, kdybys hell.
with frequent trips to London with my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a conservative, succumbed to pressure and give up its beliefs.
The following week in the teaching, when the next history professor in absolute seriousness of the "enemy of the people," I said that I decided to do the same.
Although I have within červenala furious, I admitted to me that the parents "vymyli brain" and I call "old blázny."
The relief was only short-term.
the nail in the coffin of my Oxford career zatloukl my father.
at the time he wrote every week two sloupečky to murdochových newspaper.
my door is locked by.
krčila inside and after five minutes I have my pronásledovatelé surrender.
When left sbalila I suitcase and grab the first train to London.
I never to resume.
You can call me usmrkaným slabochem.
But no 18letá girl or boy should not be the subject of intimidation in the education Institute and virulence.
But even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only came 14 Conservative Prime Ministers, but also to date behind nezaslouženou reputation points with equality and freedom of thought.

The toughest profession in the world: nosiči sulphur in the area of the volcano kawah ijen
In four of the euro hazardují nosiči in Indonesia's volcano with his life and health when they show 70 kilo of sulphur down after strmých do wandering.
There are people, for which it is their work hell, and so are working literally in hell.
This is the case with anta wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living dobýváním sulphur from the volcano kawah ijen in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, every day fárat to bottom kráteru where escape sirné gases from inside the country and in contact with the air is in solid shape.
After vyseká large blocs of sulphur, which together weighing up to 70 does the kilo of draw is on the shoulders of two bamboo baskets after harsh do wandering.
On top of the volcano, which is a 2 386 metres, it is only 250 metres, but vyčerpaným nosičům takes over 40 minutes than vystoupají želvím pace up because they maintain a balance and thoroughly rozvažují their steps to neuklouzli and nezřítili into the abyss.
They know that any klopýtnutí could become life, as it has become one of the French turistce, which years ago dove from rocks kawah ijen.
miners kawah ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulphur, which are extracted
When they are at the top, leading the way around tourists who is fotografují, as if they were monkeys in the circus, and unaveně odnášejí difficult bin to the weight that the mining company has put a little below, at an altitude of 1850 meters.
This is a company PT candi ngrimbi that benefits in a live volcano since 1960 and never apply their workers more than 656 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It sells for 10 000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemickému industry, as this nerost has its place in everyday life and is used for the production of zápalek, fun pyrotechniky, cosmetics, dynamitu and even, sugar.
"because normally wear 70 kilo of, we earn some 46 000 rupees (EUR 3.8) for each way," explains us anto, which usually have a tertiary three trips a day.
One way it takes three hours and at the end of the destruction, but can then earn their 138 000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems a negligible amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it earned on the field.
"the daily wage miners there is very high, for example, for the collection of coffee is 15 000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and pay for 14 days is two million rupees (€167)," explains carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as zedník.
There was his pay 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not as hard, but anto returned with his family to banyuwangi village near the volcano from serious reason, which is in Indonesia as convincing as síra: "I married with a young child from Bali, which is Hindu, and I took it to jávu to converted to Islam."
anto has asthma, badly he breathes, still not and eyes has podrážděné toxic gases
In its 27 years of anto three times daily risks life in a live volcano kawah ijen, whose síra on it already began to take its toll, although my face protected special mask and spectacles.
has asthma, badly he breathes, still not and its eyes are podrážděné toxic gases to escape from the volcano.
This is the price that must be paid for, to get his dream.
"I will work two more years, because I want to open up trade or to study Spanish or French," promises more than passable English.

Singapore for children to save the economy
singapurci that they do not have children, career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"The population of Singapore needs growth."
I am married and I am a patriot, you did my wife and you vlastenka. carry out our their civic duty and zploďme new life!
It may seem incredible that this is part of the advertising slogan for mentolové sweets, but still - or perhaps because of it, the video earlier this year in Singapore en masse spread on YouTube.
these sentences are part of rapu, which uses local allusions of giving "buchtu into pipes" as it makes a mockery of the birth rate in Singapore.
advertising agency bbh, which created the video, hopes that they will draw attention to the problem of this advertising vtipným way.
Artistic Director of Douglas Hamilton says that I use of music for people to meet their "civic duty."
"It is only a matter of the Internet, so it had to be fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we feel that this is a subject that we must touch.
We knew that the government tried to expand on a lot of things as perfume with feromony or organise cognitive parties.
While many of these ideas can be creative, but not fully functional.
So we are pomysleli, why not to do the nejkreativnější possible thing, such as the composition of rapu to solve this problem."
1.2 children
Those who did not take it too lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
a year spent $1 300 to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government's package for marriage and family provides up to $15,000 to the child, the maternity leave and allocates financial benefits.
But all these measures have little effect.
Singapore is a rich city state with advanced technologies in South-East Asia, also known konzervatizmem their leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore with regard to the classification of the population is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered the level of recovery, in 1976.
Why singapurci do not have more children?
Tan Wei mingová, Director of marriage and the family of the national office for population says that this is because of the "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"So people are available to a wider range of options in terms of the goals and priorities, it is not only the wedding and family," explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of free people and to delay marriage and bring children. The result is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts in the immigration policy drastically increase the flow of immigrants as a measure against the decline in the number of people it caused resentment among local residents.
on some of the Singapore website is seen explicit xenophobia against many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who have been criticized for maintaining low salaries and little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year recorded its worst election result since the beginning of the independence of the Singapore government.
After the election appeared to deal with the problem with quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the decline in birth rates has known impact on national economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health and immigration policy in the case of Singapore, there were also some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make the nestavělo so small home.
to start, for example, affect trade in real estate.
The urban development authority to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boxes from Shine," which can build in some urban areas.
These apartments have a 46 square meters and had great success in prodejnosti.
However, there is a fear that these apartments can encourage mládenecký lifestyle and deter developers to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew soon, the director of the developer of the developers, says that their "box from Shine" to sell far more quickly than more houses.
"they are popular, and they are sold on days to weeks faster than houses with greater size.
So are much better for our cash flow."
However, admits that the new standards set clearer rules developers who were previously restrained when they wanted to offer too many small houses in one project.
too become stressed
Singapore is the state.
Although the new rules could seek to increase the birth rate of the nation, the conversation singapurci workers in the financial district in the centre of the city suggests that they will have a great effect.
"people are still under stress, houses are expensive, as well as education, so many people to be postponed," says a young officer.
"others whether they have children.
But it is important for me to rely on their own time and money," says another, about a 20-year-old man.
men and women mention career, stress and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So whatever government to citizens to force to have children, they are still ultimately singapurci, who have the last word on the family.
What is private offline is private and online
privacy.
According to the dictionary vydávaného Royal Spanish academies, this is something that is of a personal nature, or "the private life that everyone has the right to protect against any disruption."
What is privacy for someone younger 16 years?
as applied to this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
understands the danger, which is exposed to when they are on the Internet of things that would surely nobody in the normal communication said?
journalists from elperiódico vyzpovídali five boys and girls between 10 and 15 years ago, who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four cases saw the concept of privacy for "something very own" on a personal level, and for "user name and password," if it was on the social network.
"has the greatest secrecy would nezveřejnil," says 10-year Jorge in trying to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
"These are very secret secret, my Mommy can know about them, but not the whole world," says.
"in my nice photos or photos, how we are playing.
There are also povídám is known.
I did not share the dive, which would not have been my, or dive, which someone zesměšnila," he says.
This boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, photos of naked people or photos of the crimes, or write humiliating or crude comments.
Jorge says that knows all 35 friends, which is on fb and their nine fans on Twitter.
Most of the relatives.
Among them is the mother of one of the accounts, which has the name and password.
"I have a Twitter account, to be able to express their views and write interesting contributions.
I do not know if I say someone is there only as I," supplements.
"social networks are fun, I can talk to relatives, who are far or fast to communicate with friends," he says.
without hesitation, he says, that it would never accept a request from unknown people.
Nor would it not, if it were to recommend someone unknown.
The case of čtrnáctiletého José is different.
the teenager's own accounts on networks and Facebook, my space, and ask for the last of the network admits that knows no 20 people from their list of friends.
"I have no fear of that, because we have something in common, such as" the music.
According to this boy, none of them nothing nenaváděl, even after it did not address or phone number.
"If I am pushing or have it from me, it simply from his account odstraním," admits.
José scores on that, having read the recommendations on Twitter.
The boys are not foreign experience with what is now called cyberbullying (kyberšikana).
"The famous girlfriends on the social network vydírali.
threatened him and asked for money.
never nedověděl who it was," confirms.
the victim, José neodhlásila of account.
"only activated the private regime."
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike jorgeho would the boy published photos of uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
"clearly that I would do this, if I have some vadil or I would simply like to.
Even though I know that this is cyberbullying," says.
key questions
marielos porrasová, an English teacher and absolventka field of education and teaching, it is that children and adolescents in social networks to focus properly, they must understand that the main aim of these networks is to inform.
states that: "the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but when there is social networks, has changed the rules of the game."
marrielos porrasová notes that academic worker Marc prensky, a graduate pedagogiky at Yale University and the author of the article digital natives and digital immigrants, these concepts to explain this phenomenon.
"digital natives are children and young people who were born in a time of this technology.
We have the digital immigrants, who must learn them, while themselves only learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue," because we are asking them to rozeznávali what is appropriate to publish and what to say, no, on the contrary, in an age when still not zralí."
also to be - with regard to the area - rozvážní, at a time when, after what is most to be oblíbení, have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences," adds.
According to this specialistky is the most effective way to children and dospívajícím show, what is privacy, ask questions, which makes them think.
"tell them not to do so, does not work," adds.
further marrielos porrasová lists some of the options: are things that you stranger nevyprávěl, so why this re doing on the Internet?
or: like those, if someone published your email dive as you those published kamarádovu?
Do you know what the rest of you publish?
When označuješ people on fotkách of the celebrations, you asked for permission from these people?
and one more: they need to constantly all know what is re doing?
Another point is, to realise that they have to behave in an environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
The rules are the same.
"one out of the Internet by respect, morality and other principles and the same should be on social networks," says.
supervision
estuardo Guardia, university professor, a teacher in the first instance and educational adviser explains that it is essential for parents of children carefully read the rules of social networks.
"If understanding každičké záludnosti, have a good basis to chatting about the consequences that the account with children on the Internet can be.
For example, with regard to age or what is allowed to share or to publish," he says.
 the Guardia Civil is of the opinion that it is vital to remind children of the traditional rule "nemluv with strangers."
South American summit ends and statements from limy was published
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) konaný in Peru today ended without would be a statement from limy, that indicated that was allegedly signed seven present Presidents.

the confirmation of both Presidents, to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, was published after Colombia this week adopted bogotský Pact, thereby expressed to the International Court, which ruled the fusion of maritime borders with Nicaragua and Colombia this decision should be completely wrong.
The summit took place without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma rouseff), Venezuela's Hugo Chávez (), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina kirchnerová).

Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was needed to Latin America to continue to be a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before its participation at the regional meeting, that hopes to meet in Mexico on Saturday with his nikaragujským counterpart Daniel ortegou with respect to discuss the ruling by the International Court of Justice on the maritime border dispute, which is disputed by bogotou.

Rafael Correa: South America must learn from the integration of Europe
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa announced today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal," in which South America, in this case really must learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth presidential summit of South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television TV perú that Europeans "kill" in World War II and in other conflicts, "but now are practically one country."
In this sense, defended the project of creating a South American citizenship, which support the Unasur member countries.
"the free movement of citizens and workers is required in any of the countries of South America, which is already under way between members of the Andean Community, however, there are more regressive, which we want to go back to the past," pointed out.
Ecuador's president, among others, said that agrees with přeskupením Organization of American States (OAS) on condition that will reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who signed the pact from San José on human rights.
"those who are at the forefront, never to use force does not oblige, and we jihoameričané, everything will sign.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington is funded by the United States," said in referring to political asylum from Ecuador, the founder of the WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
President Correa has confirmed that this decision nelituje because it betrayed its principles and respect its "deep democratic values and human rights."
Add to that at the time "there were credible allegations that Assange could be extradited to a third country, regardless of the ongoing process."
In addition, the Swedish justice, which asked him to Swedish territory underwent interrogation because of alleged sexual deliktu," own the Swedish legislation allows for interrogation videokonferenčním hovorem, which could take place from ekvádorského Embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that the assangeho there is a deterioration in the physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since, what is in our embassies, but Ambassador informed me that my small pulmonary problems, but nothing serious," said ekvádorská head of state.
"but there is that his physical and psychological condition worse, because it is closed on a small area without the movement of the fresh air.
This would affected the health of everyone," added.
President Correa noted that the asylum granted Assange since June on ekvádorském Embassy in London on the basis of the permit, which allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and point out that London held talks to resolve the founder of WikiLeaks.
"We on human rights nevyjednáváme, such a word in this case, but not always talks taking place.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, because assangeův lawyer baltazar garzón is a series of management in various European ones," said.
He said that "if the United Kingdom will tomorrow propustku, everything will end."
and if Sweden Mr assangeho listen to on ekvádorském Embassy in London or via Skype, as this allows the legislation without a problem and, as has been done in other cases will be made after this problem tomorrow."
Correa used the situation to be presented as a defender of the freedom of the press, and make it clear that it does not tolerate "podprůměrnost, bad intentions and lie that undermine freedom of expression."
The greatest enemies of free press are not we podlí and evil politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit nátlaků and blackmail," he said.
From this point of view, expressed delight at the even takovíto journalists," or bankers or hegemonic country and even speak of the bourgeoisie "Ecuador and předeslal, that if it is re-elected," will continue in the changes brought the right way and in the right direction. "
President Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto paraguayi on membership in the Union, Unasur at least until the next election and argued that the whole "must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and pučismus riddle wrapped in the legality," because in fact "undermine the legitimacy of paraguayské democracy."
Ecuador's president said that, in addition, considers "completely appropriate" fusion of the wishes of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime border between the two countries now, in time for the ruling by the International Court in The Hague, which ruled in favour of Nicaragua.
At the moment, the judgment is not accepted.
"It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
conflicts are unavoidable, but it must be overcome will go along.
We need to assess them broadly to be overcome and be able to go forward."
also expressed the hope in the settlement of the dispute over maritime borders, which is in the same Court Peru and Chile, and expressed the view that "is right for Latin America to seek international resort in both countries to commit to the judgment, however, will be tough."
In connection with the possibility that it will run in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to ucházel in order for a third mandate, noted that sees this option "with great optimism and joy, even when it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa has said that, if the elections in February 2013 loses out of public life.
"I personally never nezajímala power, but as unfair situation, such as socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can repair the only political power.
My political movement believed that it is me who guarantees that likely victory, so we need to take the responsibility," he said.
"If I won, it would be my last presidential term and would then left from the policy.
If we lose, I have the same.
I have already decided," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
"I have just spoken with Venezuelan Vice President nicolásem madurem, which says that President Chávez went on the routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
It is not a relapse in the President's health," explained.
The head of ekvádorského state is now part of the sixth summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which was concluded by calling for greater regional integration in order to sustain the development, equality, and security.
AIDS victims today are the result of late diagnosis
fabriziovi was 21 years old when he was confirmed by the outcome of the test: HIV positive.
"It was as if to me, lightning," tells in the memories of the moment of truth that a doctor tried to "moderate" a bit, but apparently without success.
a boy before family tajil.
decided to take their disease itself on their shoulders and began to inform and with such commitment, that already celebrated 43. birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of nejdávnějších units of HIV patients in the civil hospital in guadalajaře (hcg), which came in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio live with the human virus used (HIV) from 22 years, which was unthinkable in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, few treatment options and greater stigma.
then with him or the clinic Director of Mexico's social security Institute (imss) nerozloučil," because he had the cutting blow."
Then the AIDS have been synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and fully live.
However, it is a lot of people who know about their disease and come only when the virus caused the death of the organism and vysílil immune system, and then become victims of random infections.
31 years since there have been documented cases of the disease AIDS, or at least since the first in the world," is a great success that the patient's life expectancy, which will begin in a timely and appropriate manner with treatment, is exactly the same as in healthy people," said Jaime Andrade villanueva HIV troops in the civil hospital in guadalajaře that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
infektolog and specialist in HIV/AIDS Andrade villanueva explained that scientists have come to the conclusion that since 2008, AIDS is death, but the judgment that the length of survival and a full life depends on the degree of disability the patients' immune system, which is diagnosed with the disease, with better are those who are taking drugs: people with 200 cells cd4 can live up to 30 years and people with 500 cells cd4 up to 50 years.
Simply put, this means that the one who is HIV diagnostikováno in 25 years, according to these findings can "in compliance with treatment to live up to 75 years without any problems," the doctor explained in an interview.
to highlight the progress of this it is worth recalling that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years.
Although the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS, from 6 railway twice in 2007 to 4 862 in 2011 (a common agenda for the HIV/AIDS - UNAIDS), it is also true that, since the discovery of AIDS, according to the national statistics, 60 percent of patients.
only in the state of Jalisco in 2011 255 people died and in May of this year, 187, but since 2005, is to ensure universal access to antiretrovirotikům.
 - why people continue to die of the disease?
 - "It seems to me that the problem is not in the opportunities for access to treatment.
That is how I see it like this is happening in the US in the hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not run out of medical supplies, the problem is that patients come in very advanced, because they do not know the condition of, or in late stage disease."
adds compelling figure: "nine out of ten patients comes as the show some přidružená infection. All that more needs to be done to influence the overall mortality rate is used to diagnose the disease, and therefore need to be on a large scale to offer tests to identify the disease all the people who ask for them."
In its proposal coincides with specialists and officials from the National Council for the prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients as Fabrizio, who came to do tests to private laboratories just because he did his friend, and despite its low age there have also suffered from the outbreak of AIDS and kaposiho sarkomem, cancer, which is one of the complications.
"everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that umřou, and do not want to know anything more.
"If I have to die, rather, three times a week vyřádím," they say, but that is not my case.
The change was for the better, the healthy cvičím, taking drugs."
To this day, his parents knows only that suffered from cancer.
"žiju normal life as anyone.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I, I am an active sex life, but responsibly, I look out for themselves and on the other person," Fabrizio lists, which adopted a call to share their experiences with the daily Milenio Jalisco to today in the World AIDS Day encouraged those who fear their testimony.
"the tests will be done if the risk of whether knows as soon as possible, whether they are HIV positive, it is better if it were diagnostikováni, whether they realise that they can live as anyone else when they are responsible."
his message of this sums up the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
the use of condoms for standing there
Among the programs for health and ordinary citizens is a big gap, said Ricardo Salazar, guadalajarský journalist who finds the information on the HIV virus.
and the biggest gaps are in prevention.
in places, this task to actually increase the distribution of condoms," the sooner we have one or two, now give us packages and hundreds of condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have to kondomům approach," he said.
between nejnáchylnějšími to new infections are adolescents.
"what you want?" is the question of irony and assessment from social workers, school staff advisers pharmacies and medical staff, adolescents want to avoid, says reporter for.
This proposed change inefficient distribution. whether the use of condoms are not only for counters, but those 100 be located in dávkovačích public záchodcích, in places where often go young.
"It is not support promiskuity.
Nor is it a question of beer and pay them "Motel," as the Governor responded Emilio González on the question of whether he would agree to distribution prezervativů in his County.
takovásexualita is not the best is to make the use of condoms to those who have sexual life is," said.
key figures in the state of Jalisco
There have been 13 435 cases (12 158 AIDS cases and 1 317 cases of HIV).
This state of affairs is in fourth place in New Mexico and identified cases of AIDS and the 13th place in connection with HIV.
92% of infections is sexual way, 6% through blood and 2% perinatálně.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people with HIV can live as a registered case is four to five people who know about the disease.
The ruling by the Court of Appeal of the United States, which does not recognise the debt restructuring companies Group vitro a konkurzem in Mexico, a bad precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
So, it seems that corporate restructuring procedures that allow Mexican laws in the country pruhů and stars despite international agreements do not apply.
The judgment published on 15 June last year judge harlinem halem for konkurzního Court of North Texas is in practice the Mexican firms without defence against the confiscation of their property on the other side of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the Mexican producers of glass doors with reference to the Supreme Court of the United States against three irregularities.
First of all, it must be said that while the judge this case say that lenders have to insolvency law of the United States, the fifth district court of appeal, based in New Orleans said that the procedure is bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, it would indicate an international point of cooperation in cases of insolvency of the multinationals.
In fact, the law of the United Nations was created for this purpose for the unification of international trade law, which determines the arbiter of the American law Institute.
Second, the States that vote without branches of internal corporate structure, which is recognised the debt of the parent company vitro to branches would not be reached the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, this option Mexican laws allow.
The fact is that the case of vitro was not the first in which this scheme has been adopted.
There are half a dozen examples as agremex and comercial Mexicana, for whose transfer debts ručil federal bankruptcy Institute.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting votes branches would creditors - who stood against the vitro society in court in the United States, i.e. "funds supů," such as aurelios capital aurelios convergencia, elliot Internacional and Liverpool have achieved - the majority.
In the vote would have about 45 percent to 37.
This figure does not take into account the court of appeal.

bayamón in heart
with the greatest feeling of all guard those of his time in Los vaqueros since the 1950s, where a player until 1982, when at the same time, celebrated 15 years as spolumajitel or the owner of the team.
"It was my best years, the one I am most was because I had the opportunity to team with the vaqueros since 1967 in eight Cup, either as the owner, spolumajitel or coach.
It was many years of success, including five championships held in the years from 1971 to 1975.
and then I leave one of Championships - in 1981, when in bsn debuted Jerome mincy.
Then the team took "cuco" ortiz, which was an excellent chef, "said Reyes.
"I remember that gene bartow, who was here earlier trenérem and at the time he was at alabamské University in Birmingham, told me:" I have for you urostlého dvoumetrového player.
you want it? "
and it was the beginning of mincyho, one of the best players that when Puerto Rico should.
bartow me then recommended rozehrávače raymonda gausseho, who became a member of the team and one of our best střelců.
I remember that said that if mincy will bayamonu victory in the championship, gausse then would contribute to the further."
\ xC5 ampionát when team los vaqueros played gausse enjoyed, but only at a distance, because in 1988 has exercised as President of basketball Federation.

"I remember how we defeated the United States for the first time in an Olympic qualifications match in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we ended up neighborhoods, but we should have had it not been for the bronze of the Canadian referee, who let us repeat final vhazování," Reyes said.
The national team is the best team in the World Cup in 1990, which you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one which defeated the dream team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team in panamerických games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and vypráskali we team of the United States, which was quite similar to that of us vyfouklo bronze at the World Cup.
This team should not only mincyho, gausseho, Ramona rivase, Fico López and "piculína" (ortiz), but also there were young (Javier) "toñito" Colón and James Carter, Brothers leónové (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 because of injuries kolene.

What was the best player portorika?
It was without any doubt piculín ortiz.
his figures from international tournaments are impressive.
No one from portorika absence at this level of such results as piculín.
Not to mention his time in various ligách where played.
who was the best portorickým trenérem?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good generation, which includes July Toro, Flor meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond dalmau and armandito Torres.
I very much like the work of the young Leo arilla.
that its success in the Federation do you consider to be the greatest?
I was part of the most famous era of national team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s had National League bsn in one season to 17 teams.
 What you failed to prove?
The things that I wanted to, as the youth categories according to the regions.
For example, the guys from Ponce played only in their area had not been the rivals with teams from other parts of the island's only national play-off.
now children a lot of travel and play too matches, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory osvědčeních and courses for trainers, assistants rozhodčích and referee.
I am pleased about that.
