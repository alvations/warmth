That is what will happen? cssd convulsed pastry or Voldemort in Prague.
The new www.cities-localgovernments.org. CSSD at the capital's mayor will apparently overcome real language barrier to understand the level of the municipal council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS.
The Actualne.cz daily newspaper "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, on whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years at the town hall, when it was the current coalition partners who ran in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that the cream of Prague has set in motion policy during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It is with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected the terms do not understand very well known.
At least they say.
"that is Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a jeunôt in politics pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected to test the culture of the vocabulary of the" godfather ."
And with regard to the political veteran, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf hole."
"this is the only expression of those that you are suggesting that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
The vocabulary, the Aktualne.cz newspaper published the expressions in June of this year before the Congress pré-éĺectoral of the ODS, strategy-drafting has chosen 6 examples, particularly those who are linked with the mayor of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the greatest golf hole in Prague," go to the patisserie ,"" sinews of beef ,"" betrayal of the sex-capital "and" entôler. "
Three of the Parliament-elect were in favour of the quiz, the quatrieme- Antonin Weinert, which must lead education in Prague in the future - has promised to begin a maintenance but then has not won the telephone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek has refused the test.
"I am not looking at these things lá and how to enjoy the representatives of the citizens' democracy: I am not going to give my opinion."
"I am currently how we are going to understand in the context of our programs," he responded.
As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky apparently did not recognise in the Datawarehouse legend, it comes to the influential Roman Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the Bem.
"voldemort" says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague."
"this is the end of the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and adds: "But I know newspapers."
"I'm going to pay a language courses," pleasant.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected for the environment, know that the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the person - he thinks within the meaning of "go to the pastry."
"it is, I think, to go in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of the societies of Janousek.
In the same tone Brezina recalls that derives its knowledge rather newspapers and not of a kind of vocabulary that it would use.
According to the tests there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I have taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we do not really have something of this kind."
"we are saying the names of abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, that the members of the Elji Party Hulda.
"I called Briza at school but I do not know if my colleagues call me as, 'avoue Karel Brezina nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz has tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Petit old, the Representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the Party, is nicknamed the "small toy."
The nicknames are the only ones that admit to the Social Democrats Party.
It seems that Hulinsky do not really hear Hulda, but the daily Akutel.cz Prague has been another nickname for the president.
"doctor" recalls appeared Petr Hulinsky has obtained a doctorate in law JUDr.à police the Academy of bratislava.
The government wants to reduce the torture "witches," published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women reported witches have common traits.
Rather, they are part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, for example, are free and have no children.
That is becoming "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"the man has very rarely."
"I do not judge healthy young women because they are involved in the work and give birth of children," says a sister who deals in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special facility of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure."
He published a brochure, which should help limit the witch hunt.
The case has a "hic."
"more than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warned the daily Die Standard written to the disadvantage of education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other countries in Africa.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbour, Ammy Hemma, a 72 -year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man then burned with oil they threw him.
It is the BBC server which has forwarded this information.
Criminals said it was the wrong.
According to their version the oil that is used to onctions ritual emflammée in contact with the woman.
Oil has soared, apparently when the team wanted to "get rid of the bad spirit" of the woman.
The insulation of "witches" is approved by the people of all levels of education.
The daily newspaper Der Standard quoted a contractor of Burkina Faso 42 years: "The eaters of human minds have always represented a danger," he said.
While the Burkina Faso strives to reduce the witch hunt, the Gambia not later than the last year has even seen the President himself participate.
"the President of the Gambia Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, has launched a broad witch hunt which apparently had been involved in his death and is also would be tried by the black magic to kill President."
"Guinea near come to the rescue, shamans have led to the presidential firm Kanilai, under the protection of police and the presidential guard of the President, men and women selected at random break into villages of Gambia," said in a message the organization "Amnesty International.
The firm the prisoners had to drink a herbal potion to hallucinogenic effects that cause other effects on the kidneys and the gut.
Two prisoners do not have survived.
On the international pressure that is about a thousand people who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: poèles light, he signed a higher rent.
An elderly man VVO came through the door of the centre of society GARs Byty of patients' coal baron "Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to rent in the Czech Republic.
It was under his arm a dossier with three new leases for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
Deregulation has increased the rent to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to resolve from next year for a second category 4100 2 + 1 apartment Skr.
"and there is no hot water and heating works on solid fuel," shows of the finger on the new contract of his son, the man who has the power of signature.
"but I have signed," he explains motié anger and half resigned.
The civic association of rental apartments BytyOKD.cz who described the nouelles conditions as "immoral and outrageous," advise tenants not to sign and wait until December 7, which will be published a notice to explain the methodology for.
But NHRCK reacts with a gesture of the hand.
"one said that, the other says something else" as they frowned eyebrows.
The Ostrava region becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits the most apartment in Czech Republic rents do not correspond to the market price.
For this reason, Aktualne.cz decided to visit the "laboratory."
The waiting room of GARs in the street Havirovska is one of four of the Ostrava region and it is already full on Tuesday at 09 o'clock in the morning.
Next to the door is a security guard of a society with a device for clients.
A special button, "rent 2011," is on on the screen processes tactile.
One pressure and a paper with a lot of the apparatus.
You do not have the time to read your number "157" that your number is already beginning to brighten up on the big screen in the waiting room topit.
In a split second it is your turn.
After a short time, an old couple comes to learn about the rent, but the new rent do not seem to affect the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to resolve common problems such as everywhere - demand for repairs, on insurance and other events.
In the region of Ostrava, people to more than 44000 apartments of the portfolio of GARs receive the letters with the new lease contracts in their mailbox the letters for approximately mid-November.
GARs Byty offering rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
The special system for the new rent is open to the public since November 18.
"it works for almost a week, it is still up to test " responds, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the window when the client presents itself as a journalist.
The déragulation and the old Bakal apartments of minors are very sensitive a local issue.
Vice-President of Parliament and from the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek Social Democrats indicated fairly supported before the elections and that now meet the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"they don't even have changed a put... to do in the wc, chest in the introduction NHRCK mentioned.
However, this is, according to the employees, pensioners who have to be certain that they will receive a rebate on the new rent if they sign up now as promised GARs in a special offer.
It is a cut of half the amount of rent that will receive the other loctaires inter-views signed a new contract before December 15.
But the "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"among the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for the rent," says the employee in the window.
And yet GARs porpose on its website and in shop windows of individual meetings on rents when it is necessary.
If the two parties disagree on the rent it is an independent tribunal which will take the decision.
Here is not about threats but only to inform on the unique and legitimate way to act legally, "said GARs on its website.
"nobody will go to the court" believe one of GARs Byty workers and the man in the street in the centre of clients agree.
"I pension SEK 13000 and SEK 5000 to eat, I do not have enough to go to court," he says.
Suddenly the employee feels uncomfortable.
"we will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media demand that no sign and the people expect," said.
The regulation of rents ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to GARs Byty, are an economic necessity.
"and, moreover, the current rent always do not reach the level required for the maintenance of the fund for housing," Pavel Klimes, Director of the residential portfolio of GARs Byty society, that it is precisely the neglect of the funds for housing that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the increase in the rent.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 GPB have with rents to invest in the apartments, 4 billion in four years from 2011 to 2014 this should make $5,2 billion.
The large screen on the ceiling in the face of chairs around the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, however, repeat some information indicated in red.
The increase in the rent in 2011 is 15 percent and not less than 31200 apartments or more than 90 percent of the apartments of GARs. "
"and this will always be no CZK 7,50 square meters per month," said the screen.
The increase of 38 percent applies only 400 apartments of the portfolio of GARs.
"in these cases, there is an increase of a very low amount CZK 19,66 square meters," adds GARs.
The next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
Gradual GARs Byty that deregulation does not cause a radical increase but on 4 to 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all the money of the increase in rents (see the graphe) went to apartments in the form of heating - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the agreement on the increase in rent.
The nursery school, too, is part of the ITPOs have understood the architects.
The administration building Avriopoint of Brno is the new headquarters of the Arch. society design.
No one would have expected that he is also a mini nursery school with all that is needed - walls of colours, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a small playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, can visit the children of employees of Arch. design.
Society of projets-architectonique Arch. design. whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings at Brno, has found its business mini nursery school since the first drafts of the building Avriopoint.
It employs about 90 people, especially from the age of children and it is important that women architects and project leaders can quickly return to work.
At the same time that work contracts in time, the nursery is a proposed bonuses to its employees by society Arch. design. within the framework of its social programme.
The builders and architects have the possibility of linking a work with the care for children.
They are employees of Arch.Design.eux-mêmes who dreamt up this nursery school and with the support of the direction they were able to obtain a contribution of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is funded by the means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding allocations (to the tune of 2,8 CZK mil.de). they were able to buy equipment and appliances and after two years to ensure a qualified staff as well as the implementation.
After the use of the allocation of funding (two years) society Arch. design. has the obligation after 3 years of mini nursery school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted a year and it is society Economy rating that has helped to make the staffing request.
The child care is provided by a qualified staff, the day a nurse and a teacher of tongue take care of children. a native children can go to school without age limit, but they have more than three anspour most.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there are only 5 children at the same time, but during the course of the day there are more that replace.
The operation of the school is flexible, depending on the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the school without light on the position of authority.
Although it is agise individual care and education, the programme of the mini nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children aren't play but a quality education is also assured - from beginning to the school teaches English.
The class is equipped not only of toys and games imaginative but also of a computer that can be used by children.
The presence of small children in society creates an environment friendly and positive.
Parents may at any time control their child and not having the stress of a delay to seek children in a school from the workplace of parents.
Parents use to their working time of the most productive way.
It is not surprising that creates a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.design.s' is thus enshrined among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and which are friendly to the family and through this programme makes HR.
The house still fascinates after 100 years. domestic look in the eye of a proper talk.
The toît looks like the back of a saurien prehistoric, the stairs to a column of dinosaur and balconies to fish gueules open.
This is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona architect Antoni proper talk.
Because of its organic forms, the house has received from the local House nickname.
Organic forms, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, recalling facade of scales and everywhere curves, that is all that is ypique for Art Nouveau of Antoni proper talk.
The front facade of the house place its dream, its colours and textures pleasant about the nature and animals.
At a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the pace and the next thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and went in such a way that the impression of brillance RGBcolor.
The enroulement and violence "is also reflected in the domestic forms with the same degree.
Timber copy in the frameworks of windows, balustrades waves, the decorative elements of the doors, the oeilleton and slats.
The house Battlo on Eixample Gracia market in the street Passeig at. 43, was born of the construction of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction has made for two years and the house completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich businessman, was first insisted on the demolition of the vieile construction and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of a proper talk of an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as house of which was not thought by proper talk alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It is precisely on its project that are born the decorations for a representation of the owner of the apartment building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the façade have also worked for other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo began with a proper talk and succeeding cooperation between Jujol.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of a proper talk Casa Mila and park Guell in which there are other proper talk.
The premises have dubbed the house just after its finishing because of its organic forms "House."
Other, given the specific mechanism of opening windows have called "the house that drink."
It is said that in the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the boss of Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of hidden construction contain religious grounds.
Proper talk thought for the house a single system of central heating, with évents aeration and of typical chimneys.
Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd.
During the creation proper talk has not respected the directives of construction and has not been allowed to stand by them.
At the beginning of the construction he received from the city the building permits, knowing, of course that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after for finishing the municipal council was horrified and asked modifications.
He did not like, for example, the members of the council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the pavement.
There was never change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the appeal of the city Josep Battlo (and got satisfaction) permission to praise the top two floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery to the second floor there was a common living room and the third a chamber and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery.
The full house of six floors is shared by a staircase gives way to a terrace of toît independent.
All angles rights and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by walls.
Proper talk also worked the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of trade shows and high society can comfortably communicate or limit private space for more intimate conversations.
The house with the reconstruction of a proper talk has received a non-traditional toîture addition of new facades and two floors.
The game of proper talk with the light is also impressive, tiles, white and blue glass with which is decorated with the wells and the inner courtyard of lights.
The game in two colours gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house.
It must simply bet on the principle that the White reflête more than the bleak instead absorbs the sun's rays.
The house Casa Battlo which in 2005 was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund may be used by each.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious apartment and the most splendid accessible to the public.
The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150 th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They have continued the visits because they have found that it is a lucrative business and they have broadened the scope of the visits to the common spaces and the attic including the terraces of toît.
The entry ticket in the monument is not really expensive and costs EUR 16,50; students, pensioners, the groups and the tourist card holders have a 20 percent discount.
The sum is above the price of entry in the other constructions of proper talk in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its tourelles, you have to quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house.
How to choose a mattress and a sommier: women have other criteria than men.
Not ostentatious framework, but rather the quality of the surface for sleep, therefore the mattress and the sommier give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the several things are important choice,: the weight, size, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type in which will place the mattress and the sommier is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the house of campaign where the mattresses are continually sleeps in gum are not appropriate because they "hot" slowly.
In addition, they have a higher weight to the standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they do not have enough channels of breakdown in and if they remain, in addition, on a solid work, they retain moisture. of the mould may also form.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Anyone who spends the clear of time abroad where they frequently uses very thick mattress with a layer rammollissante, is hardly on a base-income hard surface.
"that is how all the hokeyistes of NHL complain that they cannot sleep there."
"for their shoulders tired, the feet and the coasts, they needed mattress with a rammollisante layer of foam lazy."
"such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system who are poorly" information "of joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in the furniture around.
That is why a few years ago the foam mattresses with lazy has conquered the hokeyistes and other clients.
"today everything goes well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico have for example, mattress.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to appreciate a foam lazy.
This "miracle" simply working.
It make its rigidity and its form in the heat absorbed or adapts to the warmth of your body.
There is no pressure on you and you do not go back into the night and after a difficult match.
Just you sleep better.
The lazy foam also function as a protection against the esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress in your size, provide the length of the feet, or about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman in a size of 180 cm have therefore need a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each to a bed for two seats should be 90 cm by 180 cm.
For the singles beds in a single place, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It is easy in the case of visit.
"but it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on their backs you should ask the hands comfortable with together slightly complied. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Bourreliers-matelassiers and decorators who indulges for several years to the issue of a healthy sleep and ergonomics non-furniture taught in the schools.
For a bed to two places everyone needs of its own sommier and mattresses, however, therefore attention during the achât to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will increase the sommier at different heights and this is not feasible on all managers.
The foam mattress should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mattress springs at least 15 cm, of this matter to the layer of form and aeration at least three centimetres.
"the infructueuses or in a sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Héléna Prokopova.
Each mattress request a specific type of sommier.
The lit-sommier, when the mattress and the sommier are united as sisters siamoises, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattress aèrent very badly; Nations-Specific the wash, who is fluent auhourd' today.
And since normally during the night there is an element of 0,2 to 0,75 the sweat it is clear that, after 5 / 7 years, the mattress is beginning to remind a great (and clogged) sieve.
For this the specialists refuse to make the KOSC on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a guaranteed for life.
But but.
The part of sellers: for a mattress and a board of experience of 120 / 140 cm, dispensing, for the surface of the mattress, hygiene or the brainwashing but add a mattress of protection rather than vouspouvez easily withdraw and washing.
And even if these days it is usual to manufacture surfaces with closure to glissière for all, that is to say that after the opening two parties (for the brainwashing and the size of the washing machine that is very important!) www.oag-bvg.gc.ca manipulation for the larger models (and for a single person) is when you cut off a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid plate instead of a sommier?
Never!
The maximum for a bed to visitors for a single night.
However équipez do (if not) of aeration holes and use the mattress springs with a minimum height of 15 cm springs in sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of aeration.
A mattress in polyurethane must not be part of a bed of this type.
For the mattress frame to slats unique position with 14 / 18 slats, the mattress in gum or sandwiches served (perhaps the combination of gum and coconut), are the ideal, but this will always be better for you to have a mattress with more of slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the part of the kidney-sellers low and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mattress to several positions should not be mattress springs because it does not respond to the changes of position.
Has the regulation of the rigidity of slats can also install what is known as a cradle.
It is a special link of the slats to pressure or even give the lamelle for the shoulder of the dormeur "fits."
For men who have "the shoulders as large as the back," it is really important.
This thing is already being considered by the manufacturers of mattresses for the "male" have started to use a rammollissante zone at the level of the shoulders.
But they also believe women - they offer a more soft surface at the level of the hips.
E-Customer the most difficult there are mattress frame or platelets with what is called a suspension multiforce.
The pressure contaminate in more points and diinue tension.
But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and increased air) on good mattress and sommier, the "most" disappears.
The basic rule is simple a pillow: the pillow must support the head and its peaks must achieve only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended size is 50 X60 cm that Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When one is lying on the side, the pillow must upgrade (with the cradle of the sommier or the rammollie area in the mattress) the shoulders.
The modern mattresses still have something in common with the first to basis of straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural substances or mixtures.
The trend is also organic mattresses.
Pétrôle, from which the raw materials to produce the polyurethane, are replaced by natural oils, such as soybean oil.
Almost all of the known manufacturers use soya.
The term "bio for the mattress means that the heart is manufactured using natural products," said Petr vasicek society Tropico Plus.
The natural materials are also used for the surface of the mattress; one of the first has been the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules developers of the forest or lavande perfumes.
There are differences between the man and woman.
While birch plants for that the surface of the mattress absorbs heat and any cooling of the body, "cooling" NHRCK, coating "light" women.
The excerpt from poivre red accelerates the bloodstream and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favourite?
The foam mattresses made from cold (it has oozed with a cellular structure disrupted more respirante than the standard polyurethane and more elasticity.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam mattresses polyzones who know exactly where the head is, the lower back and the feet.
You are charged a quality mattress to SEK 7000 and more.
Those who are characterised by their parameters for VAT have less health and are used as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, that is Gumotex which has reached the first place.
Economiser for the mattress and the sommier is not simple.
We may from time to time in the framework of special actions on the part of manufacturers or producers two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex society which proposes mattress Duofreeze with memory foam coating Memory out for 11990 Skr.
Obviously you can take the second charge.
The era of foams lazy or viscoélastiques with an open cell structure and thickness has been started with the Tempur "cosmic" at a pace.
It started as a subject for NASA parceque astronauts were to launch the load factors.
The Tempur rammollit to heat and is strengthening, on the contrary, the cold weather.
It is therefore perfectly suited to the human body hot and distributes pressure.
It is for this ideal against evil slept and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
The viscoélastiques not only for the mattress but also for the health products, such as the special pillows for the feet that relieves the legs and the veineux system.
The Czech manufacturers use for example, EucathermC or Twinsaver or foam.
The aircraft to follow people are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child leads to more and more people to think about the monitor with a GPS.
The system, put in place at the beginning for cars can also be used to trace the movement of people and help for some cases such as exmple that of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a matchbox mailbox but will soon be the size of a clock.
The case of the small Anicka moved a large number of people and they have begun to seek ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to confuse their privacy.
"we are trying to tell everyone that it is not a question of espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," said Petr Pilin society MAcro Weil which is one of the suppliers of Czech tracing devices on the market.
"I must say that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as in the bag of a person who is not aware of it, but I have not yet met such cases."
"the majority of people really are clients who buy the product for security reasons," Pilin.
He said children should always know what is used "the container" and how to use in case of emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention if the child does not want to focus on something of this kind, it débarassera.
'And even the smallest can show a great deal of creativity when it comes to get rid of something when they do not want to be under control. "
"mobile phones, which can be cut as these devices tracing, parents have already led to long expectations," says Bockova.
She said, the fact that this type of craft can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"if it is an abduction prepared, the author will do everything to ensure that the child has an electronic device that can locate him."
"it is now the phone."
"as soon as the tracing equipment, they (criminals) will also seek because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"in such cases the criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
It'avoue that such devices can help during an attack not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech society RC Monitoring, which proposes tracing services both for cars and people, says that to have this kind of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"the apparatus can be paramétré in such a way that he is in regular after a specified period."
"in the case where the aircraft is destroyed, it remains the position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive appliances have also inclinomètre that immediately reported the position of the person who has slipped in a recumbent position without taking any action, "said Cech.
He said the so-called smart phones that are fitted with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after formaté with a special prologiciel.
The problem of current tracing systems is that it is a device similar to those paid in pendentif the size of a matchbox is the smaller telephone mailbox.
We can always lose.
According to the society Pilina Macro Weil, that is why the tests are being conducted for appliances that are similar to common digital watches.
"this will have the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognize the tracing system."
"or it will report after a certain time, which would have given the police a little more time," he said.
That the tracing system developed in the form of bracelet or pendentif, it utilisiera always the same technology to make cars.
It is a combination of a position via GPS systems (which is commonly used in autonavigation) and an of a mobile phone service that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many cordeaux détonants that it could be the turn of the Czech Republic with. but it can take two years.
The army has bought 445 km of cordeaux used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of cordeaux is two to four years.
The army has bought cordeaux détonants to the company STV Group for 40 million krónur.
The General Staff has given as the reason of the achât a huge amount of cordeaux détonants FPs DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the calculations of retention-of-title to hold pyrotechniciens of the army, that FPs DNES contacted, as even the generals, officers with a command, secretaries or household should have an exercise explosives each year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to justify the army's annual consumption of 60 km of cordeaux détonants.
Has this distance is 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army could provide reserves for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the basic training of each new professionals it enough to more than 2 m of cordeaux détonants, as the experts, this means that the army with its new purchase has also assured - with the consumption of special units and engineering - of reserves for 225 years.
Yet the soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade recently complained to the Minister Vondra they have almost no ammunition for their sidearms and that the shooting sessions are limited because of money needs.
On the lack of underwear do not talk.
"and I do not take the lead they buy a large quantity of cordeaux détonants."
"and it is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"the army is a good customer for us that we are trying as traders of content," says the commercial director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, arguing the achât of hundreds of kilometres of cordeaux détonants by the fact that the army will have these "ammunition" for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group Mdcme.Ca however only four years of life of cordeaux détonants and pyrotechniciens of the police and the army of just two years.
"if they are stored in the deposits, it can go up to four years," says one who does not want his name to the criticism of the army.
The time of life, each item must be tested to see if it remains integrates and does not threaten the life of a soldier.
These tests are not free and cost money.
The other argument is one due to the rebate amount for 445 km of cordeux détonants.
"they have cost 60 percent less than the provision of the past year of 245 km," said the spokesman Pejsek the interpreter of the opinion of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of cordeaux détonants of police pyrotechniciens which neutralize the munitions from the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police still control only the quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It has been established for reasons of security pyrotechniciens and in order to obtain more flexible types of cordeaux détonants more modern and more reliable.
Today the Ministry of Defence has major problems for the elimination of dozens of tonnes of munitions from the time of the Warsaw Pact when the strong Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to travel, on the Rhine.
This expected within a few years this Czech army that FPs DNES contacted: neutralise hundreds of kilometres of old cordeaux détonants it buys today "cheap."
Up to now I benefits of contacts that I have achieved thanks to the competition.
The sale of his hotel in franchise has helped Lukas Pytloun to the winner of the competition for the best individual Contractor.
The winner of the competition for the best individual Contractor for the past year has been Lukas Pytloun, contractor for 28 years.
His adventure to the succeeding is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun loved travel.
And abroad, he realized that to Libérec it lacked a site of quality at a reasonable price.
His savings on what he had won when he worked abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small apartment block of 5 apartments in half demolished.
Knowing that he was still studying in trosième year of graduate studies, it was a courageous action.
"the relationship between quality and price of accommodation in our region has given me want to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
He began the first apartment rebuilt to foreign workers.
He reinvested the benefit in the building he transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his FoodFirst contractor has enabled him to open up to Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a total capacity of almost 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable between them was until recently the four stars Pytloun design hotel.
This year it was another of the same quality.
"we have just signed a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U Tise where we have sold our concept of frankness and other candidates for the franchise hotels Pytloun expressed," the 1 number of entrepreneurs in the past year.
"and for the sale of the licence for the implementation of a large-scale hotel victory in the competition of the entrepreneur of the year has served," Pytloun with recognition.
The victory gave her more popularity and be known to Libérec and its environs.
"people recognize me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, that it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends the participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but is a good opportunity to be visible.
He said that he uses until today its contacts and knowledge that he would not get another way.
"with those whom I met through competition I started to do business on a regular basis.
According to him, the renowned linked to succeeding has also had an impact on employees.
And it has approximately 70.
"I see among them above all the loyalty and pride to be involved in something that has been generally acknowledged."
"this is not, and by far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good job of all of us together.
"only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than we have had to Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the meaning of the winning goal of Farmet has the worst moments away.
Those who got the price Slovansky dum for the first year's competition for the Firme organized by Vodafone last year is Karel Zdarsky Brandowner Farmet society.
The board has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a workshop tools to Ceska Skalice in a firm in turnover of 100 million krónur.
I can say that the award has encouraged not only myself and my staff and has increased our confidence in itself to combat competition today, "said the winner of the competition last year.
At the beginning of the history of society Farmet there was the desire to do something useful.
And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to praise the workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the Communists, he has not hesitated long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and has created a society with a few comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic baignoires.
Not very long after they started to specialise in the presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company has been known even in the public not GFCCI after succeeding obtained in the competition through the media.
"our clients have not only started to really get to know the mark Farmet but also the foreign partners who have begun to realize that they were working with a company which has the largest succeeding in his country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year th has not gone to Farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The evaluation of the company had been made from economic results of 2008 and part of 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the height of the crisis, which has not really affected the citizens, the companies were forced to stop their investment projects and begin to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies.
"we obviously have not escaped to this situation."
"the figures fell by 40 percent, and we dûmes limit our production and lay off," said Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time we need to take unpopular measures.
But they have handled the situation correctly and have retained bénéficiares results even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However Farmet, they have continued to invest in research and development.
"we have built with the appropriations a centre of training and research, have strengthened the presentation of society in salons-expositions international and won the main rewards in the national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The figures for affires date back and with them the number of employees.
"the new democracy--more I wish this pleasant buzz of the victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which removes absurd regulations.
The investigation into the Absurdité for the fourth time of the year is a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The winner of this year of the investigation into the Absurdité of the year has been the obligation to provide in the offices of documents that officials can get online.
More than one-third of 4000 voters have voted for it.
For example, the administrations of the Social Affairs asked paper an extract from the trade register as can be obtained in two mouse clicks.
That is changing thanks to the investigation.
"the Czech administration of social insurance will no longer the excerpt from the trade register for the controls of insurance payments," said Jana Buranova Czech, spokesman for the administration of social insurance (CSSZ).
Highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must meet in the Czech Republic and to remove those who are absurd is the meaning of this competition of the Absurdité of the year.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and still has greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters identified themselves, it is at least 4000 this year for their votes.
And this is not surprising, but there are in our country the most various legal obligations which are only hinder the company, and this, more and more.
"we are perhaps the number of documents for the tax returns to the first places in the world," said Karel Havlicek of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity becomes a stated aim of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is in 74 th place with regard to the conditions for the company, 8 places higher compared to last year.
The competition of the year Absurdité has been put in place for the first time in 2006 and continues in the same scenario each year.

For reporting it gets the www.firmaroku.cz website. then, the organiser of the competition chooses seven candidates for "antiprix" and leaves the public vote during the month of October on www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdité who received the largest number of votes is declared the winner.
Until the last survey of last year, it is a hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who have lost their sense of existence.
The remarks were sent by the entrepreneurs but also the professional unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees is for example, the obligation that the maintenance vehicles motorways and express lanes pay tolls, or entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repeignent two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of seven proposals is published on the site of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition, which begins at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of a regularly into involving personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for small and medium-sized enterprises from the Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Czech Republic, attended the culmination of the competition.
'The economic prosperity cannot function when the state âtons in the legs of entrepreneurs and for this, each year, my goal is to remove at least three dozens of paragraphs that today only complicate the company ," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove décrêts absurd is not a shot in the water.
In 2007, which did not like the people is the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare individual three days before the office for the company at the location of the company, intend to go to an exhibition or a power with an Expomedia.
This obligation has been discontinued with the ammendement of the Act on the individual company.
The second most popular obligation in 2007, which was at the Bureau of a foreign service travel for an employee work on 30 days, has been removed with the text of the so-called Green Card Act.
And everything is ok until the third session of the competition.
The year 2009 was the décrêt Absurdité for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their offices, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This has been changed by order of the Ministry of Health dernière-l' year obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.

The Land Fund to Plzen, the police made the arrests during a public competition
In the building of the Fund for the Plzen Land, the anti-corruption police made the arrests in recent days.
The detectives spent handcuffed to the local contractor and trader in real estate Lubos. G.
He had tried to manipulate a public tender for the settlement of a return of such a way that the ground proposed by a candidate.
It had to pay to Lubos G. half a million krónur.
"for the moment I can only confirm that the police are still a person for insider trading in the framework of a tender and a public concour." for the Pravo newspaper said the head of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more details because the investigation is ongoing.
The police have recovered after 24 p.m. this contractor for 46 years in freedom.
For how he could influence a public competition, one can only speculate if little official information.
Has a question of Pravo, the spokesman of the Fund of Terrains Lubomira Cerna indicated that the police had really made an arrest in Plzen on a separate place of work and, in the open competition.
"it was a client and in no case of an employee," she said.
The open competition in Cerna as true name "Appeal to propose rights for the transfer of land under the Act on the land " and is put in place when several candidates beneficiaries of law.
"these people are offering, in the framework of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to resitutions that must be resolved before being announced the value of the land."
"the rights proposed a ranking of buyers is put in place and the Fund of Terrains subsequently transferred the ground to the person who has proposed the most senior rights," said the spokesman of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information on people who had registered to the appeal and, also, as it is himself a person bénéficiare having purchased a large number of rights to refunds, he proposed to field candidates not to participate in the competition.
And it encaissait is to withdraw.
Which explains why he had so much money in its possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts beyond standards FdT (Terrains Fund).
It was in the case of the former chief of the FdT Vaclav Sankot criminal who was persecuted for land for which we had already published the decision of a construction.
Precisely Lubos G. had obtained by example of land for the construction of public communications, specifically in place where the artery was to be built to access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he échangea with the town hall to a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is far superior.
The town hall was forced to accept because it might jeopardize the construction by a block of land.
A hundred krónur monthly households will pay a premium for housing.
Households will from January pay not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, supplies of heating and in some places rents will also increase.
Families will from January to jump to their wallets until a hundred krónur monthly more than now.
Electricity increases of 4,6 percent, almost 2 percent more gas, in certain localities, you will have to pay up to a tenth of the provision of water and in many places the central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The electricity is projected to increase for households in the 100 Nkr235 apartment anuellement more than at present.
However all suppliers have lowered the prices of electricity because of the sensitive to encourage the production of renewable energy development, including photovoltaÏques batteries.
The gas to increase moderately but of course the people most in need to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
A hundred Nkr235 can also count.
Although electricity and gas are increasing in the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the most common major who plan the price increase.
For example, households to Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce from January have to pay for the central heating almost SEK 50 per month, the families of Libérec will pay more than SEK 1000 annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing an increase of 9 percent for water and sanitation for the eventthat the city infrastructure is increasing rents.
If rents do not change the Prague will pay an additional 6,8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowest in comparison with the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7,4 percent.
The price of rents will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 apartments rented from January to the end of regulation.
For example, the ICC society Byty who has Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who do not agree with the new increase in rents will be brought before the courts by society.
The regulated rents paid by people in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase 10 percent next year.
Czech children are saoûlent the rum and the fernet. beer is more fashionable and slowly.
The fernet, rum, vodka and exceptional also the best brand of whisky are stolen for parents.
These are drinks that are most often those who saoûlent, which have not yet fifteen years, in the hands of the physician.
Children who have been treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the experience of doctors who have similar cases to hospital admissions Hi-lights children.
"the beers and wines are more out of fashion because it takes time to be saoûl."
'The trend is really the spirits, "said to Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Department of the hospital of children Horovice in Central Bohemia.
"when they manage to chiper father a bottle in the bed, it is sometimes wisky but it is the fernet and vodka which prevail.
"vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and not feel," says the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the hospital Motol, also supported him.
"in general, it is of the rum or fernet."
"it is now fashionable alcohol especially in elementary schools."
"in some cases, it came to slivovice they have reduced from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, see drunken children aged thirteen and fourteen years hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before work to Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he rightly held ten years in paediatrics where ambulances brought in large schoolchildren around drunk.
"a girl was treated in hospital and four times
"it acommencé his career to twelve years when it was made with 3,5 per thousand of alcohol dansle blood with a mixture with the extasy," the doctor described this case particularly important.
"it was at the Parc des Expositions of Holesovice to a party."
"what is interesting is that it became not peculiar to the mother that her daughter is absent 48 hours" astonished at the Director of the Department.
It is precisely the selflessness of parents or their tolerance that their reject follow the drink which are the main cause of child development of alcoholism.
According to the experts, it does not mention the dependence, in the strict sense, for children.
"the alcoholic is a chronic alcohol dependence of several years with all the ensuing phenomena but that are not found in children."
"among those who use the acool with, it is more of a back-ground significantly adverse," explained the Yemeni Head of Department Pélikan.
According to the spokesman Jurinova drunken, about forty children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the clinic of paediatrics at Motol.
Are integrated into the stastistiques with a grâve poisoning requiring hospitalization.
The drunken children who are after the emergency care sent home by parents or by the police, are not numbered.
In addition to the case of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, it exsite Pélikan three seasonal waves with the day of the hunt, the Saint Sylvester and the end of the school year.
"they are drinking by spite after poor results or on the contrary they are celebrating the start of the holiday."
"of course I lived to the day of the hunt a drunken admission of 7 children of a stroke," said Pélikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in désintoxciation under medical supervision is paradoxically in better position than the one that went home and suffering the aftermath of the "hangover."
The morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose are killed by an infusion of glucose and nutrients the body needs.
"they are better off because they are a very good evening and a starry-eyed awakening and nothing hurts."
"they are only surprised to where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time that spoil the good humour of patients with at least the notes to pay for their care.
The ambulance and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go up to tens of thousands of Skr.
"from time to time, I have applied this as a means of education with these children how their drunken has cost and that they could spend the summer in seasonal work to repay one evening," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their management, which should recover from the parents care, do not take the case of children drunk.
Two L- 159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
Two L- 159 aircraft of five in all, against which the Ministry of Defence has exchanged transport aircraft Casa C- 295 M, took off Tuesday for Seville in Spain where the aircraft manufacturer Casa-EADS.
This is the first time that this type of devices become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have been abroad in the framework of exercises or demonstration flights.
It is biplaces versions of T1 L- 159 which, until now in service in the Czech army and which were in a state of flight.
Lestrois remaining appliances are monoplaces versions of L- 159.
They are for the moment in Aéro Vodochody trading and the e-Hotline - the firm Omnipol last week - has taken into account.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, physical Vodochody is currently unknown.
'The L- 159 aircraft monoplaces planned for the exchange have been taken on aircraft stored for a long time without charges or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence. "
"the biplaces T1 L- 159 were exchanged in the state," said for Pravo Pejsek.
He added that the army will not remain without shackled loveseat since the department was signed in May 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement with a value of 200 million kroner for the transformation of four monoplaces L- 159 unused in two biplaces.
The army has taken delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second to delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS is committed to introduce the aircraft in the equipment of some countries of the Alliance.
"in the contract it is clear that whoever takes the L- 159 aircraft is EADS and that they will be used to pilot training of NATO countries."
"it is therefore a matter of that which takes into account to determine how to achieve this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in the L- 159.
The exchange of five L- 159 for a plane Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,5 billion kronor was endorsed last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched tender and has contacted directly EADS.
The direction of the defence arguments that the exchange L- 159's future export abroad.
The Czech army has purchased in Aéro Vodochody appliances and uses that 72, 24, to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft Casa is likely to have legal implications.
The European Commission has filed a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence of the European Court of Justice because the aircraft will be chosen in a tender at European level and in no case by directly contacting a manufacturer.
The army has already taken delivery of three planes Casa, the latter should arrive at the Prague airport Kbely in two weeks.
A longer index that the rot is a sign of low risk of cancer
The men who have the index more than the rot are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"our findings show that the relative length of the finger is simple test of risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men for 60 years," proclaimed the co-author of the study Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine which men would have to take the test for prostate cancer, including by combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants as the antécedents family health, Eeles added.
During the 1994-2009 period she has followed with his colleagues in Britain more than 1500 prostate cancer patients and healthy nearly three thousand men at the same time.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index of the right hand shorter than the rot.
For them and for the 19 percent of those who had the fingers of the same length, we found the same probability of a prostate cancer.
In the case of those who had the greater that the rot the risk, however, is down to 33 percent for men 60 years before the reduction of the risk was 87 percent.
The report for the length of two fingers - trained during the prenatal period - different levels of sex hormones that the child in the womb.
Less testosterone is a longer index.
Previous research had shown that it is precisely the testosterone that development aid of a prostate cancer.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, Czech Geneticist renowned and former president of the Academy of Sciences, KTC that he is aware of this study, but that, apparently, he did not think that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer is "completely demonstrated."

The 25 mm developed for this special gun and ammunition containing a highly explosive breaking, functioned as small grenades.
Ammunition in such a way that they can AJB00 will soar in the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind a barrier, a wall or a gap.
It is not protected from above and when he is coming at a rain of shards of steel, it also can put the hors de combat.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of XM- 25, the new gun is the first infantry weapon that uses the 'smart' technology.
"the soldier is used mainly in such a way that it is the target, sends out a laser which determines the distance, creates a specific point of reporting, that it corrects the approach of the site and based on the trigger.
"say you have referred to 543 metres."
"when you squeeze the trigger, the weapon is the distance of 543 metres and more or less, 1, 2, 3, said Audette.
400 jobs being moved
The Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary of Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The next year in July, 400 FoPs will transfer to Astro Park their place of work, which is currently at the office building of the Mareinbader Square in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu relocated its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As on Wednesday said the GFCCI giant in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located on the Marienbader of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, enormous complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße Unit Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A spokesman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should bring together 100 other jobs yet scattered in the region.
The supply of rental has been extremely attractive. in addition, the offices to open areas of Astro Park are best suited to the work of FoPs.
Also at Bad Homburg, Fujitsu has been fair tenant.
The Director General, Bernd Wagner, said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
He said that the connection to the airport is of great importance for a comprehensive business such as Fujitsu.
The new move of a large company within the region has attracted the joy of the winners and losers disappointment yesterday.
The head of the economic affairs of the City of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global player" had been conquered.
It is a "extraordinary profession of faith on the location."
Fujitsu agreed to the city and its location is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (green), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Management has very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"it goes without saying that we have offered our support for this," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, the friendly relations would change anything to the difficulties of the manufacturer of computers in the face of the owner of the building of Marienbader Place.
In the end, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid a place if exceptional remains lie empty for a long time.
"I hope that the owner and lender of UNDC5 will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Square of the Hotel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu society and the neighbouring 'small vertical', as well as the rest of the Place Marienbad buildings, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was set up between the station and the City Hotel. it gave rise to a lot of criticism, not only because of the impressive LPID surfaces that once were part of parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the rating company and investment advice, Feri, the manufacturer of computers for the travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, moved to the buildings.
In 2006, The German group of Frankfurt GFCCI Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the property fund Morgan Stanley. a year later, these buildings have been resold to Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments company based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group is headquartered in Tokyo sees itself as the world's third largest supplier of computer products.
For example, it puts computers and servers in the provision of businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch established in the region of the Main-Rhein is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu has certainly much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, Bad Homburg moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad. the other subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
To this end, 7000 square metres have leased in the building Astro Park.
This old complex of twenty years, Cicetekelo recalls its star-shaped plan, among other houses the headquarters of the Confederation of electronics and electrical engineering.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr. Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming very difficult.
The Internet service provider Amazon has expelled from its servers the GFCCI site in the disclosure of confidential documents.
This attitude may be of political pressures after the publications of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
Mr Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, is apparently staying in England.
The United States, the site Wikileaks is being attacked with greater force.
The Group of cyber-activistes "Wikileaks" has more access to its server housed here in America and is now seeking a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, the eminent US Senator Joe Lieberman, has called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, is probably in Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"WikiLeaks excluded from Amazon server."
"freedom of expression in the country of freedom," indicated Wednesday (local time) the origin of cyber-activistes revelations via the social network Twitter.
Recently, the cyber-entreprise, Amazon, had removed the Wikileaks documents of its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activistes have resorted to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in order to be able to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Goody, our dollars are spent to care for people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression is a problem to Amazon, "they should stop trying to sell books."
CNN television, citing NATCOM of Mr Liebermann, reported that Amazon forbade Wikileaks to use its servers after the investigation by the FoPs Senator Joe Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate's committee for the protection of the territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, the British newspaper reported, "The Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to take this measure earlier with regard to previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the senator.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann has urged other countries to refuse the use of www.achq.dnd.ca by the platform.
"WikiLeaks is acting illegally, monstrous and unscrupulous. in so doing, it puts our national security at risk and people's lives around the world," according to a statement of the independent senators.
"no company aware of its responsibilities, be it American or foreign, should help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the stolen documents."
Mr Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of people wanted by Interpol.
According to information provided by the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39 -year-old who lives in Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activiste has constantly called intrigues orchestrated by its detractors prosecution against her by Sweden.
The Wikileaks spokesman, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that threats have been issued against the site.
"there have even been calls for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange was particularly concerned for his safety, "said Hrafnsson.
It is also why the founder of WikiLeaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly pointed to statements made in North America.
In America, the Republican former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has demanded that the leaders of the revelations made by Wikileaks hounded and executed for treason.
In Canada, the advisor of the Head of Government Mr stephen Harper said on television, ironically, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could use a "Drone."
Meanwhile, an argument broke out between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the US president, Barack Obama, has described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr assange has demanded the resignation of the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and leaked desk-drop, to engage in espionage.
"I do not know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of an individual owner of a Web site," says Mr Gibbs.
"our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than the claims of a website."
The US government is now completely tested the protection of its databases.
According to a statement from the White House, Mr Russell Travers, deputy director of the Centre of the fight against terrorism, has been appointed responsible for combating the leaks.
Mr Travers is in charge of putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" which after the disclosures of diplomatic cables by WikiLeaks.
The White House also has the desire to check the means by which the administration exchange and protects the information.
In addition, the US government has announced that he wanted to look after the safety of dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"we worked hard to make contact with them," said State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"we are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of the Glace
The 'Gelato "University of Bologna, preparing confectioners of ice to the best seasons of the year.
The Learn-to-Play course of three days in the future glaciers has had a very successful and attracted visitors from throughout the world.
In fact, where the ice?
Of the Glacier and the ice machine.
The German glacier in the confiseur on a little old-fashioned, ice cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice.
The turbine to remove the ice cream of the showcase refrigerated ice to the aid of a spatule, has in the gaufre and then began to sell it.
To find out, we did not need to go to Anzola Dell Emilia Bologna in the province.
But anyone who wants to know more about the ice, cannot avoid " Gelato-University " of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of sorbetières founded the University of ice in 2003 so that the ice creams lifted out of its machines are everywhere to Italian ideals.
The Learn-to-Play course of three days in the future glaciers has had a very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
Special courses are also available on the ice of chocolate and several days. similarly, practical sessions are held in the glacerie.
In the midst of a midlife crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others are simply to carry out their yearning desire on the ice is smooth.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of artistic education come to California is a stickler of the movement Slow Food. he wants to propose an European product in the future of the industrial Glace quality in the country.
Anke Berlin is business management advisor and after a few years, she wants to learn something of singular this work hard on the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glacerie in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another time Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because its Italian children love the icy creams.
The master Luciano glacier Ferrari explained firstly to participants the ideal characteristics of ice.
Is crucial not only the right flavor, but also the flexibility soyeuse and the right consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, southern Italian: "The ice is simply the best: and she retains a dose of romanticism."
The first step in the production seems simple.
Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers in a large mélangeur said all 85 degrees through an electronic programme and cooling immediately to four degrees.
He then opened a tap installed on the machine: it has a basic white cream pasteurized milk, the foundation of all kinds of ice.
The trainer is also beset by question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against the fact be misled by the spirit of the time.
Anyone who does that ice "made from natural ingredients," has perhaps despite this used stabilisers: the more often a natural product, for example, of the seed meal of guar achieved from the guar bean.
It is of course possible to manufacture of stabilising the ice without using, just to sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client croquera nothing other than ice pellet.
Some of the basic mass modifications are permitted.
This becomes more exciting with flavourings.
The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one gains in the fruit or sweets of the supermarket.
In addition, there are the powder and pulp.
"suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of aromatised ingredients."
"however, you should simply try."
In the revenues of sorbets fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
In the icy creams made from the mass of white, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and, when combined with cocoa powder, the basis of all the possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the use of ice machines.
Luciano invited from time to time to produce four types of ice: vanilla, chocolate, the moka and hazelnuts, with or without eggs, with varying degrees of vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of ice to the fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit purée: from the point of view of the taste, that is not necessarily better.
The ice is not necessarily the taste of the nuts, hazelnuts when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
The ice in the kiwi fruit, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less of stabilizing.
"only a balanced mix is the taste of ice," says Luciano correctly.
The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: if the use of fishing puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice in lemon.
Luciano has a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the wine growers are used to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables are extending the calculations.
The manufacture of ice does not require, as in the past, physical intervention.
This is not only the mass of manufacturing the machine autocategorizers basis that helps.
There is also a device which is simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it onctueux and reduced to low temperatures.
In spite of all the automatisations, small failures are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo barbouille of fruit puree from head to feet and, thus, éclabousse his comrades when the control of huge bowl mélangeur escapes.
The master Luciano is of the opinion that a "incident is likely to occur in each course: it is only a matter of time."
The supervisors in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry which tested the cultivation of genetically modified plants has infiltrated the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the group of experts Testbiotech which is regarded as an independent institute for the assessment of the consequences of the biotéchnologie.
"it sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr Christoph on Wednesday at Munich's subsequent work, Director of Testbiotech.
There are reports of what the President of the Group of experts Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
It is funded by the groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé, or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper worked a decisive contribution to the development of the testing requirements of the Efsa for genetically modified plants and is, therefore, clearly in a situation of conflict of interest, according to the criticisms made by Mr's subsequent work.
The requirements laid down correspond directly, by paragraphs, the positions of the pressure group Ilsi and thus bear the mark of the industry which, basically, would be controlled by the authorities in Parma in Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech denounces a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking official of the Efsa has recently joined without condition or transitional period CW-CISC relashionship Swiss Syngenta. by doing this, it has changed sides.
There is little time, even the Central Radio of Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's authority for control and the industrial lobby, which has aroused suspicion of the German Federal Environment Agency that MEPs.
However, the Efsa admits the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that exploits all reliable data, including those of the industry as long as they are of good quality work.
It does not prohibit experts working for the EU--have Efsa to establish contact with this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr Kuiper admits that it works for the International Institute for the life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
The organization sees itself as a neutral forum bringing together which, among other things, belong to the field of science, industry and the policy in order to assess the risks of biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this case, the independent experts such as Mr's subsequent work resent the fact that genetically modified crops will be accepted without any food testing in animals and Pe9233.htm not tested the impact of these plants on the environment.
"we want to know what is, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize field," says Mr subsequent work.
The current practice is to test the proteins isolated only and not the genetically modified plant, which makes it impossible to obtain reliable results.
"if we don't seek the risks, how can we find out?" asked Mr subsequent work on an accusatory tone.
It is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific conducts research since 1994 in the field of genetics and is currently working on the polytechnic of Zurich.
In this region, as the United States, and now also in Europe, the sector of the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit the scientific criticism.
That is why, it barely exists even researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the view of businesses, the critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck says " industry control security research. "
The trace of stone
Uli Gsell is achieved, a total of about 400 kilo.
On Monday afternoon, she was before the Stuttgart with its tube station on the back.
There were manif.
It was snowing.
History is known: In September, excavators came and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was the same: Several thousands of people have demonstrated against the project S21, the transformation of the Central Station Stuttgart in an underground station which will cost several billion euros.
A large part of the view--shared was in ruins when the demonstration led to the arrest of construction.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the limestone coquillier Crailsheim), a stone and rude poorly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43 -year-old sculptor resident in Ostfildern.
He has brought a few fragments.
"these stones are relics."
"they must not disappear."
He said: "a modest rock and cheap, simple and land."
He said that in the etched in the month, he felt the smell of cigarette smoke.
It is not yet known what it will do with this fragment.
The rocks of the time.
Uli Gsell.
The traces of the Stuttgart lead to a former ammunition depot of the French army in a forest near Tubingue, where MSITS Rongen has built its empire of stones.
This 44 -year-old trade old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"this would be a shame if they were concassées or if they disappear in the discharge" he says in his office in a mud hut, which was once a.
He said that he was the subject of insults and threats when in September the newspapers reported that he had bought the rest of the view--shared north to the demolition company.
But he has negotiated for days with the opponents of the project S21.
And he said it could do nothing at all to oppose the demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most sensible thing would be to continue to use the stone.
About 200 opponents of the project S21 have subsequently won one of parallélépipède stone weighing an average of 80 kilos whose value is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some as album.asp in custody while also hoping to make it at a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tonnes, 25 full cargo of a truck.
About half is still packed together in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Owners of gardens, gardeners their, Particuliers.
They are coming from everywhere and have won everything that could go into the trunk and trailers.
These stones of Stuttgart scandal for a long time in "Mäuerle" or limitations of strength of herbs.
"in fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Rongen.
"eut-été this policy."
He joined his car, and around 20 hectares of its vast empire.
He attended law school that he has abandoned. later, he began to study biology before turning to the computer and finally become a carrier.
And a fan of stones.
It stores 40000 tonnes.
It is hoarding treasures everywhere in Germany.
It is the largest merchant ancient stones.
It is réfrène.
Stones of sand sculptées with art are laid on the snow.
"traditionally, Elles were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, "he says with enthusiasm.
"my favourite stone."
It takes the path through the forest.
It shows a lot of finger: Pierre of red sand, previously, part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"travertin."
The parallélépipède was once part of the gallery of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of the stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from police, the granite reddish from the cathedral Blasien, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, What efforts, what sweat!
When Mr Rongen believe that once the stones were sculptées displaced and with the help of palans simple and carts pulled by horse, it becomes quite respectful.
"it would be a scandal if such a heritage was shattered."
It is not become rich, still less great.
But this carrier today employs 14 people. in addition, the tailors of stones, a sculptor, a sledgehammer, a souffleur of glass and a gardener in the forest.
"we are working hard, but it is gratifying," says the recycler of waste.
Soon, he will be in Cologne.
There, too, there are stones to save.
Potential fight of talent for the senior
The counter is a great deal of pressure.
16 students they are lining up to buy of salmon buns, baked and blancs-mangers.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen design and mechanical engineering students were invited to a workshop.
In the framework of a competition of ideas, they must speak trade in the car of the future with the designers of VW, and, in passing, the firm Volkswagen.
These days, many companies do not hesitate to go to the body to body in the competition to find best brains, such as Volkswagen, and engage in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recruter graduates the brightest as much as possible in lecture theatres before arriving on the labour market and they are courted by others.
And since the universities do not publish statements regarding the performance of their students, we are trying to identify the exceptional skills in the framework of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Brauschweig the automotive group amadoue talent.
A young lady of the personnel service shares the pens, sweets and maps with the logo of Volkswagen.
It speaks of the timetable of jobs coe.int. professionals and students young talents; Coneco shows roads for access to the group.
It is Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig that is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "The students come into contact with this industrial sector and gaining in experience."
"the Volkswagen group, it can be students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. track, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which it seeks to attract students.
"traditionally, the focus was on the Professional-to-Professional project," Mr. Selle.
The fight for the conquest of new graduates will become even more intense.
In many sectors, companies can no longer recruit their staff through a sorting on a host of candidates.
But, above all, they must highlight their reliability and woo the highly qualified workforce.
It is mainly from the fields of engineering graduates who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 engineers remained unoccupied posts in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, an engineer will widen the gap for posts.
Novel Dykta goes to the talent hunt for the EU--have KPMG accounting, auditing firm, and advice.
It Information-Non-Governmental of costly events aimed at the recruitment of talents, such as the cruise KPMG-Race, a kind of rallye-papier where the competitors must find their way to the aid of the GPS coordinates.
The company will send hope-raising eight students next year so that they travel to the United States.
The participants may incidentally visit KPMG and the company's subsidiaries.
Those who participate decides to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the crop of many candidates will fly away for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search of potential senior in universities are increasingly important.
"we want to emerge out of the race."
"for us, a simple cruise was too little"
For the hunter of talent that is Mr Dykta, the account appears to be.
"until today, we have been in contact with all those who took part last year to a similar action."
"some of them are about to complete their studies and wish to leave soon their applications to our company." he said.
Outside of the direct amadouement carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are very traditional by participating in trade fairs where they are engaged in the hunt for brains.
"we are trying to achieve the graduates participating in trade shows."
"for example, in the solar technologies," said Mrs lounge Sitha Stübe, head of human resources in Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
The company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Stübe is aware of the problem.
Currently, 35 posts are placed in the competition on the site of the company.
"at the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"it is expensive and time consuming," guarantee?
Another way to establish the contact is to go through the university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various institutions of higher education, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"teachers indicate that the student has the possibility of traineeships professionals or write its draft .Administers among us."
Advertising campaigns expensive solar specialists are announced.
That is why the company is trying to make its advertising in highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"often, a large group cannot do this," supports Mrs Stübe, chief of staff.
There is a long time that money is no longer the main role in the job search.
The flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are the other determinants.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55 th among the 100 best employers of Germany.
The institute is a table of annual honour German employers.
To this end, he asked the FoPs on their degree of satisfaction with their work and to its context and look at the conditions of employees.
The chief of staff Mrs Stübe hope that this investment will enhance the image of society among job seekers.
"I think the candidates mainly to external assessments regarding a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more of authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means above all to take internal measures.
"the best way for an attractive employer to travel is by way of its own staff," he says.
It is called, according to the jargon in the sector, the strategy of internal image, i.e. the creation of the image of the employer within its own workforce.
"the FoPs satisfied are the best messengers."
When treats its employees well and they identify with the company, they are all advertising of their employer to their friends and acquaintances.
"it is as if it was playing in an orchestra," says Mr Kriegler.
Obama puts a brake on new oil rigs
There is no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, State of the south-east of the United States, in the years to come.
The government of Washington made a ban A equivalent ban and, thus, definitively abolished its original plans.
Even new drilling off the Atlantic coast, remain for the time being banned.
The Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
That is, in April, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform "'which is at the root of this ban. it must remain in force at least for the next five years.
Facing this accident that claimed the lives of eleven employees and led to the worst environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and of this sector of activity, said he was willing to allow the implementation of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution want to reduce the US dependence on foreign countries for supplies of oil.
The question of who bears the responsibility of the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not, to date, finally resolved.
The British oil group, which is facing multi-billion compensation claims, is at the centre of the accusations.
A committee of inquiry set up by Obama must submit its conclusions in December.
In October, the Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of the drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform.
As a result of this decision, oil groups had submitted requests for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and tougher safety measures, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of in-depth reforms.
At the same time, Mr Obama announced the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups.
The actors of this sector of activity now publicly warn against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than this is the case until now.
"the government's objective is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector" depending on the outcome of a current survey carried out in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance regret the uncertainty which characterises this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
The investments made in support of new projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing in rivers is well-functioning brown; it is a smell similar to that which exists in the petrol station: Because of a brain, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni countries in Nigeria.
Men live of theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"do not chase," the environmentalist to journalists for the calm: "You still enough mud of oil to the lens of water."
The 37 -year-old Nigerian tried to take a photograph of a young descended in water miry up to the chest, and the trail fat that surrounds it: This seems almost beautiful scene in the shadow of water to the colour of the rainbow.
We cannot see that the basement is full of brown water of crude oil.
On the side of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom said that, once, there was shrimp by whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely exhausted.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil has been building up of a pipeline which has exploded in the vast swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby town of Bodo must now pull for six hours to reach the fishing grounds: The Ogoni countries located at the heart of the Niger Delta is regarded as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The full extent of the devastation is plain to see leafing through the marshes of mangrove forests by watercourses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat out brown water cradingue. anyone who has his hand cut off any covered in oil.
The roots of small mangrove forests are emerging as sticks of pipes. the isolated palm trees are sadly hang their diver.
We look in vain for the clouds of birds, as practised in the wetlands: Dés motors stop, a bizarre silence in this paradise of old who looks like a petrol station by the smell.
"what is happening here, it is war against the environment," says Mr Celestine Akpobari sad air: "Our life is characterised by a constant danger with regard to health."
The comparison is made.
The region where the Ogoni people live is a battlefield besieged for dozens of years: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorers have penetrated here; the first was held in the 1980 s by Ken Saro-Wiwa. that was carried out later. in 1993, the group Shell had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the Ogoni return is prohibited in this society: As more than 2 million barrel of oil are being siphoned off on a daily basis through more than 5000 oil wells and 7000 kilometres of pipelines in the whole of the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the country's oil fields Ogoni are untapped, because the situation is too unstable oil for this group.
Every few hundred metres in water tréteaux steel as bizarre sculptures: The very affectionate "Christmas trees" refers to the head of drilling holes.
They have up to 50 years, most are being undermined by corrosion until reference.
Akpobari believes that a drilling of this nature is broken piece from time to time, as a steady stream of crude oil flows in the water.
According to the experts' estimates, more than two billion litres spilled on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the quantity of oil equivalent to that which has passed in the sea at the accident of super-pétrolier "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off the coast of Alaska, one of the biggest environmental disaster in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for the persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this question divides the player.
For the Shell Group, the siphonage and sabotage of oil pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. environmentalists consider the explosions of drilling and oil pipelines perforated as the main causes.
In 2008, the American scientist Richard Steiner blamed the Shell Group to enforce safety standards in Nigeria essentially less strict than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of pipeline-owners was "still much higher than alleures."
Some emerging forms of wetlands to a place that, from afar, looks like an abandoned workshop, full of work and installed at fresh air: They are completely naked and covered in to work.
A fire scintille under one of the many barrels that sometimes associated with pipes, sometimes scattered without charge on the site must be répérés illegal: a small refinery.
It was heat the crude oil in the lines for several hours, "says Michael, the team leader.
Initially, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, to the end of the conduct of kerosene tombent drops and you have finally diesel.
That is how Michael and his four FoPs produce every day four barrels of 300 litres of diesel: "We grosses $34 000 Naira," approximately $22.
Delta residents take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest producer of oil in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than ridiculously low of just 40 euro cents per litre of diesel: Because they acquire gratuitement their raw material.
This is provided by the "protectors" which the network of oil pipelines in successful Ogoni all across the country. according to the experts, the country loses in this way at least 16 million litres of crude oil in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a small completely insignificant part of the raw material stored provisionally is illegally purifiée: organised crime networks which are also among its members of military officials, politicians and take the lion's share of tankers and the selling off on the world market.
The militant Akpobari considers that the debate on the question of whether to assign the environmental disaster or rather the subversive activities to the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"if the oil companies were not seen as intruders and if the livelihoods of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
But the relations of the Ogoni, weakness, especially to Shell have deteriorated so much that it was no longer any question that the withdrawal of the group. "perhaps that operators with other nationalities, such as Chinese, will be better."
Then, Michael became nervous.
"it is high time that you déguerpissiez" robust oil worker.
"the soldiers can occur at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will not be the subject of an arrest, but at most they will offer bribes.
Even the soldiers above all from the north of the country to benefit as the raw material of all Nigerians.
"at any point of view, this rotten trick our country," Akpori regret.
Investigators discover construction defects in the reactors of the A380
The A380 is clearly suffering from a major security problem.
In reviewing a device which has made an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible lack of construction that can lead to "catastrophic failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the manufacturer of the reactor.
In early November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had clearly been luckier: During the investigation, the Australian air safety authority has found that the reactors of some aircraft A380 presented a serious security problem, and it warns of a possible default of construction.
This potential failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue and coves of leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, been in a position published on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the reactors."
The reactors are manufactured from Rolls-Royce, and equipping 20 of the series A380 aircraft.
The Airbus of the company Quantas emergency, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal proceedings against the English manufacturer of reactors.
Australian she filed a complaint in a federal court based in Sydney. this approach gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident in early November.
Coins are spare and long chalk was damaged during the fire engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that is at the origin of the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have reported that other tests relating to security will be done on the superjumbos who are also equipped reactors in questions.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the ASTB, Mr Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered important enough to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing his plane, the airline Quantas had stopped its A380 fleet during a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily stopped three of its eleven A380.
The company, as a precautionary measure, Lufthansa has replaced the reactor A380.
The two-tier plane is the world's largest airliner.
The fall of snow on the entire territory is causing chaos in transport
Germany covered in white: In one night, the snow fell on almost all of the country.
Chaos prevailed on all roads, trains and planes are grounded.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
The winter shivering Germany: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered by snow in the Thursday night, leading to chaos in many localities.
In the north and east, coverage of snow 15 centimetres in places.
The movement is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
National on the A7 from Flensburg, the winter has worked on a permanent basis, but they have not been able to overcome the snow to accumulate.
In addition, violent gusts have swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The federal Bureau of maritime navigation and water (DSH) of tidal wave is expected to take place on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels of up to 1.2 m above normal.
The federal heaps of snow on motorways and roads have led to serious problems in Saxony.
That is why the Central warning of bad weather Meteomedia announced the violet alert level was announced in Switzerland saxonne: in fact, this is the highest level.
In some places, it fell 30 centimetres of fresh snow that the strong winds and costs have dispersed.
Several lorries and cars have remained stuck at night.
Even in the land of saxe-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced major disruption on the roads.
On the A2 motorway, the snow and the wind have led to an interruption of the movement and caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfalls have hit the highways A4 and A9.
According to the Deutscher Bahn, of serious disturbances of the rail traffic took place in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: the snow on the railways, the fallen trees on the railways, the caténaires or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, we had to interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
To Sallfeld, in Thuringia, a train to Munich ICE had to interrupt his trip.
The firefighters and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept roads.
The Exploring of snow have caused many flight cancellations in the main airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman of the standard and information on flights, a few cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport indicates that 40 flights have been cancelled in Frankfurt am Main.
The winter service over a continuous-cover service.
It is true that passengers stuck at the airport are more numerous, despite that barely 400 beds are available to them.
Accidents have occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
The evening to Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life in a collision with a train at a level crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly injured.
Because of the layers of snow on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a level crossing because the vehicle was stopped.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured in the train, that is why the road from Bayreuth at Nuremberg has been closed until the hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30 -year-old woman died when his car was on a slippery road to Aschaffenburg barrel.
However, meteorologists shows some good news: The snow is soft and dried, but tourbillonnera in case of small gusts.
But the wind.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong winds and fast.
However, it is very cold, up to 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank is seeking a buyer for its twin towers.
The Deutsche Bank is seeking to separate from its emblem: According to information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could yield up to Euro 500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just to embellish the seat of the group: The twin towers in the Unit business have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is obviously seeking to recover the cost of renovations and it seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as writing in the Financial Times Deutschland newspaper, quoting a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the sale.
He said "we check if it is more interesting to occupy the buildings or to sell ourselves, and to new rental later."
That is the largest financial institution of Germany has already given its seat, shortly after.
It is only in the middle of the year 2007 that the bank had acquired the twin towers for an amount of Euro 272 million to the holders of own funds. she then had rehabilitated.
The changes to the optimisation energy have gobbled up, according to some estimates, approximately EUR 200 million.
A sale would, of course, a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, of this sector experts estimate the value of the towers, rebaptisées meanwhile 'green' Towers, around 500 million.
According to the spokesman, it is not currently known if the buildings will be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people are mourning minors who have lost their lives.
Buried in New Zealand, more than 10.000 people have had a thought for minors who have been declared dead in the wake of several explosions in a mine.
We had not yet been able to recover the body because the security situation in different wells continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors between 17 and 62 years had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced in the affected wells, but it had found no trace of survivors.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and other explosions that have followed, no rescue team was able to take to the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent bang, the authorities and the administration had considered that minors had no chance to survive.
So far the bodies could be increased.
Today, parents and friends held a party to the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people gathered under a sun shining Greymouth south of the island of New Zealand.
They have observed two minutes of silence.
Buried in memory of the 29 minors, 29 tables were installed on which we could see the names, helmets and lamps.
The photographs and personal effects, including clothing and the planks of surfing, also had their place.
The flags were flown at half-mast in all public buildings in the country.
The New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants in the commemorative celebration that New Zealand has held out hope that minors radiocarbon to the surface.
"but they are never returned to the house."
Mr Lawrie Drew whose son Zen has been buried in mass graves said that he cannot get over the death of his son as he has not seen his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats have taken part in the memorial celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin were also buried at the first explosion on 19 November.
The aid workers began to extinguish a fire in the coal mine of the South Island of New Zealand.
The Police Commissioner Gary Knowles explained to journalists that when the masses of explosive gas are misplaced, burning temperatures inside the mine began to fall.
Goes to hell, warrior!
The film Splatter an artificial film?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the former race thanks to his film, "Valhalla Rising," epic.
How public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn there able to think in ccsa.ca. "Valhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) owning only one eye is taken prisoner; he broke free of his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates one after the other adversaries. this seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses of the brutal methods of assassination. when it is in a bad mood, it severs the gut of its enemies without wait until they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed said no word on his true name. even the other characters leave escape, at most, one or two sentences a few terrible agony.
Otherwise, nothing is being said and festoie incredibly beautiful in the mountainous landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the universe of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago.
That would be the ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest for the existentialisme and for the travellings excellent.
When a film is several target groups, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy on the fierce drug smuggler and full of style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but it refuses to make a little more in the mood to the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality art cinema.
Most of the supporters of the cinema of art must have the horror in the brain that is spreading around and gut.
Fans of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed boards, for reasons that can be freely interpret violent, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship to Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to remain silent.
It is not surprising that "Valhalla Rising" has found no distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format.
This is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not a question of dialogue in this film, or a coherent action, everything is nervous atmosphere, a dream turned into a film.
The viewer cannot escape.
Refn barely a moment of détente and cuts slowly give him the throat with images of cold weather and a soundtrack dismal, but elusive hatred that comes from the heart of the characters.
Only a young boy Virginia, which faithfully stands with the one-eyed, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose mobile are not known, but returned to hell at any time to combat enemies and allies temporarily turning into warrior, may be sent by the devil himself.
It represents the decay, but perhaps also, for those who are, in any way, ."
"Valhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can hating or admire, who has designed the agitation, the enthusiasm and the astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious work of Caterpillar
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) provides new indications for a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to submit to the controls of the agency.
On the night of 5 to 6 September 2007 to midnight, at least four Israeli F- 15 I fighter planes attacked a mysterious form design on the Syrian territory.
It is on the side of the euphrate; the largest city near is at 30 kilometres is Dair as-Sur.
His name appears in the IAEA documents, because it is a question of the reactor that Syria has reportedly built with the help of North Korea in parallélépipède of stone, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electrical power.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April 2008, the reactor, known as the name of the nearby el-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium for atomic weapons.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950 s.
The CIA has shown a video presentation of satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, they indicated that the likely location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the plant which represents a miniature copy of the nord-Coréen model of the Yongbyon nuclear plant.
In addition, she has presented the photos showing the building, even within it.
It seems that the reactor was about to be put into service, but it was not yet equipped for fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, barely more information than is available at the time, and even, with the time more and more the mystery deepens.
The former US President George W. Bush has revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor to el-Kibar peu' indications this country, but was "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence agents in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and speak only a "deemed" reactor, even if they see the presentation of the CIA as "plausible."
They have a lack of evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
Asked about how it ensures that it has a nuclear reactor, a high-ranking diplomat of the United Nations has just given a terse response in summer by saying that the IAEA had enough of "documents to ask questions."
The Syrian have certainly kidnapped with haste the rubble of the "unused military building" and proceeded to an orderly resolution of the ground.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by the former chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA has received thanks to a Member State commercial providers of satellite images showing the time took the attaque. it seems that charterparties are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, has the exclusivity.
It is impossible for the IAEA to determine their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always ensured that she had never made a secret nuclear programme and that it had not built reactor.
Damascus maintains that uranium found at the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the IAEA has rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles as implausible.
Since that time, damas refuses any discussion on this issue, as on satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow the controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and denied access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But, even Israel retains a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, said recently: "We will never comments on this subject."
That is how the investigation of this matter has been dragging on since June 2008 without a result and that it "is increasingly turning into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as acknowledged by a high-ranking Western diplomat in service at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, he is a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons.
The IAEA considers that to achieve progress, the existence of three other facilities must have "a functional report" with the alleged reactor.
So far, the inspectors did not indicate what kind of facilities it is or what is their function or suspected to contain.
According to reports published by the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung ', they are known within the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also the name of nearby towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security Institute (International Institute of Science and International Security) of Washington has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images of a complex close to Masyaf which is likely to be one of the suspects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to it; this is exactly the reason why Syria refuses access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, it states that the Syrians are afraid that the inspection group is in fact spies who would be sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is an intelligence provided by the American secret agents who attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has the information, including satellite photos, that the vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the parallélépipède stone in transporting substances.
A senior Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used to fuel production."
He would not "information on sensitive activities," such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor works certainly thanks to not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there is to the rigour of plausible assumptions regarding the following fundamental questions: where should have come where would we separate plutonium and uranium needed for the production of the bomb.
We do not know if the rubble, which could hide traces of great value, were stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of trucks LFIS vanish, nobody will have information on the place of storage of rubble.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has made al-Tibni examine the salt mine in 1998, only a few kilometres of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Tigris, to see if it can agree on the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently afdeling satellite pictures for the famous magazine Jane's, the former inspector of the IAEA, Mr Robert Kelley has established a link between them and the reactor in question.
However, satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken of earth-moving work in the three sites suspects and displaced huge containers when the IAEA started to demand access to these places.
It is possible that this is a coincidence, but this has not contributed to remove the suspicions.
In in diplomatic circles, it is said that the IAEA has spent several months to draw up a plan for the inspections to be carried out. this plan should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets. only time invested shows how great the inspectors interest in this matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also responded to this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna did not state of the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this matter, "says, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States a few months since what is known as the special inspections, one of the most powerful tools available to the International Atomic Energy Agency to implement its controls.
The director of the IAEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open to the future," but it is still.
This means there is a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA and many of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation escalate.
On the other hand, as réflechir diplomat: "At this point, if at the end they do not find anything"
The love in a time of war
Tough times since that Angelina Jolie has made its debut in the summer as a maker.
She wrote the script itself: it is a story of love between a man and a woman from Bosnia of Serb origin.
We know nothing about this story, but that is enough to trigger the malaise.
A persistent rumour indicates that the woman, a Muslim, Serb executioner fell in love during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's federations have immediately protested. in response, some planned shooting sequences in Sarajevo have been displaced in the final minute in Hungary.
Meanwhile, the movie was made in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests are still continuing in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a letter addressed to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet with the actress. beautiful UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador herself.
It is not already diplomat. a few weeks ago, she proposed that these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they have declined the offer.
"the meeting to be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says on its attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the organisation of Hasecic subsequently, recommended to the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie writing?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received copies of its scenario, has granted after some hesitation a shooting authorisation to Sarajevo, but we do not know why is not then come despite this authorization.
The young author itself ensures that it does not pursue political objectives with his film, that this is a great deal of effort that it has made aware of the Yugoslav conflict. she said that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give the possibility to all parties involved to speak.
However, it remains vague on the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet. it is quite different: The love knew well before the start of the war. he will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported in the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guardian.
This is a great difference between the version "a victim of rape amourache executioner."
That Jolie's film started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, and Jolie, is "unfair and based on information erronnées."
Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: In this scenario illegally in the Net, like many others before.
Let us!
This evening, everything is going well again among the Irish.
Not a trace of dismay.
That is why the local team dominates the visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans are shouting for joy on a strong music, they could.
Baileyu-pub Cork in southern irlande vibrates because the players involved and manage to break down the bullets of table tennis at a distance of three metres in gobelets beer of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "bière-pong." the winner pockets 500 Euros a plane ticket to go see in Las Vegas in January at the World Cup of bière-pong.
This Tanner is an individual calm; the subtle game to drink and computer engineering, both, really do not go well together.
And yet, despite this, the 26 -year-old man seeks to have fun, to turn on the question térébrante, which will result in the future.
The pleasure of play in Las Vegas is not in its projects. in January, he will lead interviews in New Zealand.
"I do have a strange feeling," he says.
"the country is so far and I have no job."
Finally: His copine already in Auckland, "in less than two, she won her job liked as responsible for project factual, perhaps a good sign," says the young man with a smile.
Because of a bleak outlook for the country, two of the three sisters of Tanner have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lies in Sydney, his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
The young move: The situation of most of the families who live on the island are similar to that of tanning.
Experts from the Institute of economic and social research indicates that 100.000 Irish people leave their countries.
They even provide for a number of 200.000 migrants by 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecast holds, it will be a stream of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980 s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish were, now the grief takes place.
The economic crisis, however, especially young Irish people, well trained, who have so far that moments of happiness.
The loss of employment and the social decay seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there is money.
But, in the meantime, three in ten under thirty years of age are unemployed.
The Irish Times newspaper publishes many letters from readers by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is going to the dogs."
"there should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but anyone who has the possibilities, leaves and our country and a whole generation."
"the last to leave out the light."
The student in law Leanne Caulfield, chairman of the Irish students' union, highlighting a bleaker future because the government only pull the wool over the eyes and offers no prospect of future for young people.
"they reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the young student of 20 years.
She sees his comrades is clinging to a practice not paid to another.
She states that are its biggest concerns is itself to emigrate in four years.
"this is a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue.
Mclarnon Information-Non-Governmental the show "WorkingAbroadExpo" which provides a full support on the theme "work abroad."
"but the work abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for the new in the profession to take the first step in the levels of the occupational hierarchy," says the head.
His website shows pictures of the surfers in Australia and surfers of snow in Canada.
The message is clear: Travailler abroad is not a boat, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere.
There was nothing to be done in Ireland for 29 years the engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector th Germany.
A fashion house fate in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hannover or Berlin.
Meanwhile, O Donovan only rarely visit his home country, because it contributes to a position of extra work, in order to conclude to repay the credit contracted to build his house at home.
"the situation is already a little bonkers," he says in crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live now."
It breaks out an embarrassed laugh by crossing the cold chambers.
The small house is in a residential area with front gardens well treated, expensive cars of major brands are stationed on the access routes.
Four years ago, O Donovan has bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, financed by the credit to 100 percent.
"there were moments of madness, without doubt, the money was easy," he said.
Afraid of collapse because of the credit?
O Donovan was looking for a moment, are getting hot tea and says: "I have no children to maintain and I am young, same everything goes wrong, I can go back to zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations that it is often these days.
"no one should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as bad as what once lived here in the island," he says.
"working for a time abroad, this is not the worst that can happen, perhaps that is what makes us feel at first Irish.
He laughs and then spoke of his father who went in England in the last major economic crisis.
"it was to return after spending seven years and, in Ireland, life continued."
This idea appeals to this Tanner.
Let the future and discover how life is happening elsewhere.
In its charts, There are already a few years of work in London. it is the reason why the life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and for his copine.
But there is still something that concerns these days: the party to organise on the occasion of his 27 th birthday in Dublin.
It fears that it could turn into evening of farewell.
"only, not a lot of emotions," he says with a long sweep of beer.
"a farewell, it is worrying."
"call it rather an evening goodbye, relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
The Democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as to private enterprise.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the US in much of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest poll Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two elements stand out of this year's results of the survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the relatively sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has gone from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy rebounded after a sharp decline in production last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents from the region said they were satisfied with the way democracy in their countries worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3)
Some 34% said they had confidence in the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but rising sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have shaken the support for democracy.
If it has lasted for the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many of store-survey was a brief recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a network of social security has helped to protect the poor.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty have risen only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32%.)
But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected by a widely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where the violent crimes have increased.
It is only the second time since the survey began more than respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see Table 5).
Approximately 31% say that they or one of their close have been the victim of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise in support of the private company and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents from the region say that private enterprise is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% of the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, take many private companies.
Brazil is the greatest leader in the region, mentioned by respondents (19% against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down by 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered the most influential country by the respondents in Mexico and in most of Central America, while Venezuela has this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote tainted
Nobody expected to hold general elections in Haiti on November 28.
But it was much worse than the "outsiders" who wanted to help the affected countries and in fear.
Ballot papers were presented of ballot boxes and a new ballot, scattered in the goutières, polling stations ransacked and intimidation
The polling stations open late in the evening.
Many of Hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, had slipped in the neighbourhood finding out where to vote.
Some of them were eventually abandoned.
A dozen of presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, have denounced the fraud and have called for the annulment of the election.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "a fair election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they do not "believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily had invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, the opponents are beholden to René Préval, outgoing President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected second round is scheduled for January.
All hope is not lost in the election.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial appeal for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second toura reached the second round.
With a cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors who are still living in tents, it was feared that the participation would be.
Myself, many Haitïens wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption.
Almost 250 000, needed for voting, identity cards were not distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
The donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitians themselves.
The toes to the center
The weeks after having become suddenly widow, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's President, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved its approval rating of 20 points, to more than 50%; it is to its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet turn this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, clearly in mourning, that it would abandon the intransigence of her deceased husband or not, former political partner and predecessor, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain unclear.
Mr Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife takes as chairman, had the habit of making budgets which under-appreciate its tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This has resulted in the first couple of spending the extra money at will.
Ms Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the members of the ruling Peronist movement dissidents to Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian in the face one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to fight," said the president.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president still more room for manoeuvre to spend at will.
The economy overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage claims of trade unions, this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made it a priority to growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation.
It has refused to deal with the IMF, it has harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the statistical office, which has carried out falsifications of official statistics on inflation.
Mrs Fernandez to moderate these policies?
It has called for talks between private companies and the union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
This is perhaps the reason why Mrs Fernandez shows signs of wanting to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had refused an earlier restructuring of the debt on which Argentina had not settled its deadlines in 2001.
Now Ms Fernandez seems to be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6,7 trillion.
The Kirchners have always insisted on the fact that this could involve surveillance by the IMF, as is custom.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, has announced that the fund would provide a "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index; what looks like a prelude to the clean-up of the INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs Fernandez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of its mandate, now that her husband is no longer with him.
If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in Mars, the wave of sympathy for it has fallen.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate, without noise, many of the policies of her husband.
A demi-hourra for China
The Taiwanese voters are geared towards a kind of a closer union with the mainland.
What Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the Straits?
More than 7.5 million voters are presented on November 27, or 70% of eligible persons, to elect mayors and councillors in five urban districts, in the framework of what is regarded as a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma is itself become a substitute for the feelings from the continent, with innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr Ma pass the test, but only just.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) has won three of the five local authorities, it has failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the démocrate-progressiste Party (DPP), which has opted for the independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all the votes for the KMT of 45%.
If this had been a presidential elections, Mr Ma would be in difficulty.
Since he was elected two years ago, the part of his party's vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has drawn voters, even with the KMT in the municipal councils.
The event has revealed most of the main topics of Taiwanese elections, including lorries to aggressive campaign and flags of mass rally with girls who danced in holding.
An undeclinable mysterious assassination attempt has also been carried out.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, honorary president of the KMT election, has done a tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man of the crowd has fired on the young Mr Lien, purely through the face, injuring and killing a bystander.
Strangely, it has not been determined whether the sniper wanted to hurt to Mr Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, the murder has had an impact on the election in the suspicion on the DPP leader and in ccsa.ca. electors to the KMT.
Perhaps the biggest winner of the elections was China.
It was striking that the question of the continent itself was absent.
Instead, the candidates have been with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hate the military threat from China.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid putting its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also failed to stir up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is the answer to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr Ma, for its part, has claimed a confirmation on whether its policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It is expected that the government in Beijing continues to provide the commercial facilities, in accordance with its strategy to deceive Taiwan, of the eerie.
China has lost no time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organise a summit on the protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Certainly, she would also like to see a political integration; but let us start at the beginning.
It is better to wait until after the presidential election of 2012.
The DPP is reinventing itself.
Two years ago, it was bad: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates began under the leadership of Mrs Tsai and the PDP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Mrs Tsai was welcomed as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, who has served under Mr Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that also can engage with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, on condition that their talks can take place without preconditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that his party has a trustworthy "alternative" in relation to the hasty approach to Mr. Ma on China.
Mr Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PDP candidate would have fared better if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatic, not to run for the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, the DPP will find it hard to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT introspection.
Mr Ma's assessments have been low, despite a sharp economic growth, the KMT candidate did not want to campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be largely due to unemployment and the widening of the gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said that his cabinet as well as local offices will be revised.
The PDP good results suggest that Taiwan's support for the rapprochement.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return is already past."
Appointments to the Grammy Awards: the jazz singer Esperanza called Spalding is a surprise selected in the category of "best new artist"
Done at the request of a president, and people are required to read.
Esperanza called Spalding, the jazz and singer from 26 years bassiste withered away by President Obama to perform at its ceremony of Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of "best new artist."
Whereas called Spalding is a very experienced on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment is a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards that an artist should not stay out of three albums before registration; what "establishes the public identity of that artist."
Its ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," was certainly a step forward and, given his voice slightly engaging style, his skilful hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible for at least a large boxes to called Spalding compared to the meteoric success of President Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of Grammy Awards taking account of jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer TRIO in the " instrumental album " category, transferred on a shiver revigorant registration which was one of the main favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody's 4 B" of saxophoniste veteran James Moody's and " Positootly " of claviériste John Beasley will include in competition.
Trombones Shorty, favourite to the New Orleans and invited to Me "Treme" of HBO, has been honoured in the category of contemporary jazz; which is bowing down strongly towards a merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won a few well-deserved recognition in the bigger picture; in competition with the fittest chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Set and the eternal aventurier Dave Holland whose album "pathways" of its octet' 's live was a good example of the democratic control of this bassiste as head of group.
Appointment of the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in conventional categories
The conventional appointments for the 53 th annual Grammy Awards are a mixture of landscapes of musicians and composers of the world.
At the top of the list of appointments, "Deus identified Machina" Michael Daugherty, for the piano and the orchestra, with five "yes" and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an orchestrale electric, with three "yes."
Among the nominees with links to the Southern California, there is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for its Toussaint No. 4, "Los Angeles," a work which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also vying for a reward.
Conventional appointments are spread over 13 categories covering recordings of choir and orchestra, opera, solo.
A classic for the producer of the year category features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The appointments for the classic album are the Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw Bruckner; "Deus identified Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony Daugherty" of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; " Dreamhouse " of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and SYNERGY Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" featuring various artists; and the Chicago " Requiem " of Verdi Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominees are "Lulu Berg Orchestra of the Royal Opera House," "Marc Antonio th Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse'Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Loin Amour" of Kaija Saariaho the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" Rodion Shchedrin theatre of the Youth Orchestra and the Altenburg for Mariinsky; and " Ivanhoé " of Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Contemporary composers who are in place for Grammy Awards for the composition Pärt account for the Toussaint No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus identified Machina," Hans Werner Henze on "Appassionatamente Plus, Magnus Lindberg for" Graffiti "and Shchedrin for" The Wanderer Enchanted. "
The Toussaint No. 4 of Pärt was its first in Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, led by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the oil ex-magnat Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was jailed in Russia.
"Mandolin Concerto Dorman" was nominated for instrumental soloist with an orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles said that it aviat writing the work of 15 minutes for the interpreter to the mandoline Avi Avital, who played the concerts with the Metropolis Together, sitting in New York.

In the category of conventional mixtures, the soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for its registration "Roots: my life, my song"
The project of the mosque of Temecula won the approval of the planning committee.
A mosque to Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning committee after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project, arguing that it was the promotion of terrorism as well as traffic congestion.
But Commissioners have ruled on Wednesday evening that the new religious centre comply with local laws and that it would be esthétiquement impressive.
"many people are here to support: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you say," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I am proud, as an American citizen."
"this shows that justice prevails."
"the opposition is really minimal," he added.
"they just have some very strong voices."
"we have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18 a.m. and lasted until nearly midnight with people, most of the time, calling for or against the COMI, speaking time almost equally distributed, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate has continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"there is more of America," wrote one speaker.
"this is another planet of the apes with Miss Liberty died in the sand."
"America."
The planned Islamic centres have also been protests in other parts of the country, including the Ground Zero, site of the attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced the violence in the Temecula Valley.
Its congregation of about 135 families co-existe without incident in the county of Riverside for years but wanted a bigger and better than the warehouse space it has leased on a shared ownership with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet to the architecture of Mediterranean style would consist of two minarets and would amount to 43 feet.
It would be a 4.32 -hectare site on the road Nicolas approximately two miles to the east of the Chaparral high school.
Opponents can still appeal against this project on the municipal council.
A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a bizarre bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers found the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that this shows that the life opportunities beyond the major elements which were considered essential.
"this organization has a dual capacity."
"it can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"that is why it is very special, even if it really is a form of life" foreign, "commented Paul Davies C. W. of the Arizona State University, co-author of the report contained in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus.
But the researchers found that the bacteria, found in the lake Mono, California, is able to continue to grow after having replaced the phosphorus by arsenic.
"we wondered what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognize the life, to know what life is like, said Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss, which did not divulge the details of the discovery, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other environments, agencies might be able to use other elements to activate the biochemistry and that the whole" standard "elements, that we consider it absolutely necessary for life, could not be set," said Charles Cockell global, a professor at the Institute of Science and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"this work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
This was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrologie of NASA, who led the study, has chosen the lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Phosphorus and arsenic are chemically similar; thus, she speculated that a microbe two substances could be in a position to replace the one to the other.
Arsenic is poisonous "mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to that of phosphorus."
"therefore, the agencies have struggled to distinguish these components separately."
"but arsenic is sufficiently different to that it does not exactly as the phosphorus; he got inside and, in some way, pulls together the work of our biochemical machine," said Anbar.
Researchers have collected the bacteria known as GFAJ- 1 and exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with the phosphorus but the fact that he can live with arsenic in the place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally on Earth or on another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
Arsenic was most common at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, "she says, so the researchers have speculated that the first forms of life could use it.
This suggests that there may be other ways of the life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The stolen exposure last two dogs were found to Compton
The two other dogs on four stolen from outside a motel to Bellflower were found, the marshals in Los Angeles County have anoncé Thursday.
The four dogs exposure - two akitas and two corgis pembroke Welsh - have disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the truck Chevy Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 of Bellflower, the authorities have announced.
Two dogs have been recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, the spokesman of the department of the county's sheriff of Los Angeles.
"the good news is that the dogs are doing well," says Whitmore.
"they are in good manners."
"they have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say where the dogs had been found, in what area and what were the circumstances of their discovery.
"an investigation is underway."
"we do not want to say," Whitmore he said.
"we are following orders."
The owners of dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for a comment on Thursday.
They have been reunited on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas county in an animal locatedon Downey.
The sheriff's deputies have found the truck and the two dogs on Compton separately.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 -year-old male, and Didi, a female of 10 months - were safe and sound, the authorities have announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, Japanese for the owners of dogs, were likely disparu until their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Peek Reding and Rickard, who live in, are in town this weekend in the framework of the National championat "AKC / Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they were present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in competitions for other events planned in the days preceding the "AKC / Eukanuba exposure," said Peek to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the judgments of the as-and-when-needed canine exposure of nearly a month.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard have checked into the motel.
They frequently in motels and garent their truck outside, next to the window of their rooms.
They took three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a terrier Parson Russell and épagneul Breton - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they have left the Akitas and corgis, fur thicker in the truck where it would be cooler.
They have a little open windows, so that the dogs can get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the truck at 6 p.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead to corgis, with a microchip to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to be ashamed of, the restructuring of GMMs is awaiting the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, GMMs has finally been given the green light to start from scratch.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York, was officially praised Thursday the "pre-packaged" by creditors plan that approximately $5 billion of the debt would be deleted, opening the way to the business of entertainment, with 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision, that the plan meets the requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, there are still no legal obstacle to GMMs to stay afloat under the tutelage of the founders of entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the directors-general of what will be a studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 in 400.
GMMs will not emerge from Chapter 11 as; Chase will not have a credit facility of $500 million, to finance the new operations and products of GMMs.
It is being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which is itself at $75 million, and should be funded to mid-December.
The process of restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was committed to advise the direction on how to get its finances as it did not have the means to pay the interest amounting to $300 million per year.
In August, the director general, Harry Sloan, has been replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial difficulties of conducting research and the more than 140 creditors of the studio have taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties have agreed, at the end of 2009, put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted little of bidders including none of them was prepared to pay the $2 billion more in which creditors were to research.
In the spring of this year, it was again while the GMMs team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreements and internal debates, has finally been approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When GMMs officially fate of bankruptcy in the following weeks, businesses Moelis and Cooper bonuses of millions of dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper, companies that have collected $375 000 per month for their services to .corporate management, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum account to boost production of GMMs, which has released only one movie this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films from 2012.
They also intend to co-finance two films based on "the Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a separate loan between $265 000 000 and $275 million to fund its share in these two films, which must be achieved by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which holds about 18% of the debt of GMMs, tried to achieve a merger of the studio with Lions Gate entertainment, where it is the main shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies have not led to an agreement.
I think toys to maintain your gifts budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year is the most wonderful toy, perhaps, the IPAD, followed by the video game system of Microsoft, Kinect, both can make a significant gap in your budget gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bicycles BMX $99 and a game Kinect cost the same amount as 10 strings to classical jump of pearls, or approximately 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gifts budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club BJ - to see electronic toys that I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the --Moore Law has evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price, if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, there is generally less than new toys associated with Web sites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Penguin Club, have more tender.
And toys to button batteries are increasing, as well as toys to rechargeable batteries.
A few recommendations.
(all prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise indicated.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and older) are toys of the size of a guinea pig who sing a note when you press them down.
Pressure is equal to a note, and a second call a song.
If you buy several, they sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start to support, you can't stop you.
To combine the song to dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and older) is the best choice.
Based on the technology of Elmo Live last year, the 14 -inch doll animatronique plays games in turn as Simon Says and can make the lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with blocking of wheels.
Children who have essyaé the toy uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents complain of a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 80 s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is to return (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack full of game cards questionnaire designed to transform a still floating in car in a session with an auto-correction and no good filing floodgates.
If you are suspicious when your child is your smartphone, three inuvik.info alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60, for 3 to 8 years) is the less expensive and easier to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70, for 3 to 12 years), it is the first major revision of the range Leapster, with a more recent screen and brighter.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
The iXL Fisher-Price ($90, for 3 to 7 years) uses a system of type iTunes to offer electronic games and books and has an entry for EAs card display photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before the time, it is ideal for a competition spellings unprepared.
Increasingly, the toys have a kind of online connection.
In is based only on their presence in the shops of toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
Online to buy your child a pet of the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix CNMMP Match Figure Pack, $5, for 6 to 12 years) which includes a room of a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives sufficient money at the store Club Penguin to two articles to the choice.
It may consist of hockey skates to or a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly more than the kinds of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10) for 5 years and older) is the last micro-robots cell button.
The false bestiole moves quickly on 12 pasta implants vibrant in random directions.
It is amusing to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find its way through.
It is also strong.
Ours has resisted a drop of the kitchen table and even a temporary crossing in the hangover of our dog.
Make a warmer side in maintaining order in China
Tang Shenbin arpentait of the city as a sergeant severely urban nement by visiting its expenses, with orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan - responsible for large public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary repression and penchant for violence - some impression in a set of spectators.
"are you right!"

More than a government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city has required that all new recruits have a diploma.
The Guangdong Province has exchanged the gris-vert blue uniforms against a supposedly more engaging.
Wuhan, in central China, has replaced the baisser-les-yeux by strong-arm:: in 2009, a report said that 50 officers had surrounded a trolley to uncontrollable fondness with black eyes, firmly for half a hour, until the colporteur is packing up its affairs and parte.
Xindu, an urban district of 680 000 people in Chengdu, has chosen to make a big operation of image.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police of 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police dégrossie a kinder, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulty in attracting the eyes on this underground urban brigade of China
And, critics say.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed to enforce the municipal orders by imposing administrative fines or other sanctions.
But the Chinese media portray the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei have beaten to death an observer after he has used his mobile phone to film in the process to disperse a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a training manual for the inspectors of Beijing, stolen and put online, describes how effectively overcome the offenders without one.
This year in Shanghai, a colporteur watermelons was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A video game steeped in violence, available for download online, shows Chinese inspectors trained in street sellers.
"chengguan marked the government," suffered last year China Daily, a national publication, after yet another argument about the tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say the approach is very far.
After the district has put an ad in October to find eight female recruits, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News, asked if women had real tasks or if they were a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The announcement of the district required female candidates, aged 18 to 22 years, of having a nice silhouette and "the five features of the face in the right order."
They must have a higher than average size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The retirement age of 26 is mandatory.
The officers have said that the work was physically too painful for women over the age of 25.
"it is their image that is important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a Web site quasi-gouvernementale.
"firstly, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they agree; it is about the size, weight, of the features of the face, etc"
Then come the temperament and the "qualifications."
The women of Chengguan are like vases to flowers, he said, adding: "In addition to be vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the office of management of the district of the city, do not agree with this description.
But he noted that the requirements for the standard were the norm in many Chinese offers of employment for both sexes.
That is the case of the exigeance on the agenda of the features of the face.
That means the is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
Of course, people with disabilities or nurtured should not apply.
"we cannot allow a person or a mailbox bossu serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"he should not give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrol on the place Baoguang almost a monastery, is 22 and has the cheeks pommelées with a mouth finely incurvées.
It does not consider the value of its appearance as sexist, is there said.
"do you think that look sexy in this uniform?" she asked of a disenchanted air.
Xu Yang, his colleague to fossettes aged 21 years, said: "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They do not oppose what their mandate is limited, they said, because they have greater career ambitions than simply hunting sellers in the streets where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a dozen itinerant traders who move quickly to walk, trying to sell the most of buns or bowls of tofu before reaching the brain.
'master Wang, you should leave. "
"we have already told you!" several times, then Mrs Xu said that a seller has fled on foot, temporarily abandoning its vélo-charrette noodles.
The officers describe their functions as monotonous rather than difficult.
"this is about the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who studied marketing after work.
"great routine."
One of the reasons is that the female agents do not have the power to confiscate the property of their male counterparts sellers.
They can threaten to point out the male offenders to their superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public exhibitions of animosity against the bureaucracy which are common in China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that the agents of chengguan had killed a seller.
In a night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the government's chengguan were injured, 14 vehicles have been reversed or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But the calm is not guaranteed.
Just two blocks away in the quiet place Baoguang, where female officers patrouillaient this morning, more than 50 people gathered around the corner.
The agents have seized a motorbike that was being restored on the pavement rather than in a store, as the regulation imposes.
The owner of the motorbike cried to the scandal.
A trial of strength of 15 minutes followed before the police, the sinister face, have come to blows to shoulder to their vehicle and have gone up to speed with the motorbike and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, his White returned to hide his name badge.
As the female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 years or more - purely play a supporting role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in order to maintain an image cirée.
"sometimes we fight verbally."
"sometimes we are physically fighting," said Mr. Li said a neutral tone.
"most of the time, it is the public that begins."
Prosecutors do not inculperont Senator Ensign
The Department of Justice prosecutors have lifted the criminal charges brought on Senator John Ensign, arising from a matter related to an assistant of a former campaign and its efforts to obtain a work of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have anoncé the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was seen as a possible Republican candidate in the presidential election of 2012 until the scandal surrounding his case is the national headlines last year and damage his career.
The office of Mr Ensign said he was "very pleased" by the decision, which is the result of a year-long investigation.
The senator could still be subject to disciplinary measures taken by the Senate ethics committee.
Mr Ensign lawyers have said that the Department of Justice has "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer the subject of the investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this matter."
The Department of Justice has refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, that there is significant evidence that Mr Ensign federal criminal would have conspired to violate a ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work for the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, relating to the case of Senator with it.
Mrs Hampton once served as treasurer at a campaign of Ensign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of political donors to find work for Mr. Hampton and, then, he has defended their rights after they have committed Mr Hampton for lobbying for them, according to documents and interviews.
Given that Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr Ensign, he was prohibited by law for a year of his former employer lobby or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts have argued that the unusual agreement between Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seems to be in contradiction with the absolute ban of the revolving door of lobbying.
According to the evidence that has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defence of clients in an investigation by the government.
Although the department judge has refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers have said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of setbacks cashed by its section of the public integrity, including the decision last year to abandon the proceedings against the former senator Ted Stevens accused of lack of prosecution.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General of the citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that received several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"this basically says high-ranking government officials can now take the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign Senior Counsel, said in an interview that he had received on Monday a telephone call from a prosecutor of the Department of Justice and the next day, saying that the department did not seek charges against his client.
The team of lawyers from Mr Ensign had cooperated with prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, as his office has reaffirmed on Wednesday in a press release, "had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments that he had made the prosecution.
"I am not comfortable to go into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we believe that they have made the right decision," at-il said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission has decided to abandon an independent investigation following a complaint by the ethics committee, claiming that the payment of $96,000 by the parents of Mr Ensign Hampton violated federal election law.
The electoral commission has said that she did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada, which has long supported Senator, is a company for which Mr Ensign has helped Mr. Hampton find work of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company has welcomed Mr Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr Hampton and told him that he "martelait" the Department of the Interior on an issue.
Mr Ensign has also participated in a lunch with Mr Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of transportation to set a meeting on behalf of the airline following Mr Hampton lobbying.
When the news of the case have surfaced last year, Mr Ensign has apologised to his constituents and resigned from his post as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After having maintained a low profile for several months, Mr Ensign said two weeks ago that he intends to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr Ensign was the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, said he hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and would put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, "she says.
The appeal of Cheshire will flow to Twitter
A dozen of them were ticking away in the rows of the courtroom.
They were all the minutes of the reports of horrific testimonies via Twitter.
In the end, the defence has said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children to bed in a house that has been burnt down.
On Thursday, widely adopted the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family in Connecticut, Cheshire, should lead to a formal end where the judge would impose the death penalty, adopted by the board.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already put forward arguments to the court that outlines elements of appeal, likely to be the courts for years.
This is of course is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," a spokin saturation and instant with inflammatory details that the board has been influenced by the public passions.
Demand could push the appeal judges to debate on the question of whether the new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms.
"I have experience in this trial; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtrooms violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr. Hayes' lawyer, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of State, has laconically bulldozing over last week rejected the claims in the decision, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the board would have been inspired by the passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
The appellate courts recognized for decades that the media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the Supreme Court of the United States has overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopaths, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television and film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal for review half a century later the condemnation of Mr Hayes can be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr Sheppard.
"there is a general right to worry about the impact of new media in large-scale trials," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it has been applied arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue says that some appeal judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the instant communication from courtrooms could allow fairer trial.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by lawyers of Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years; what is delaying the implementation.
Defence lawyers also said, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered damage when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors macabre photographs of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they had been horrified by the photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and his daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years.
Defence lawyers say they will also contest the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge has unjustly expelled one of juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and he has improperly put pressure for a verdict in taking the unusual decision to get the board to discuss in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the largest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case has dominated the media scene in Connecticut and it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for the post of governor and Senate of the United States.
They have maintained that the computer media are changing and fanning the flames of the emotion of the case.
"the daily scramble of media tweets, cameras and journalists in front of the palace of justice," the lawyers wrote, "looked like nothing of what has been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
Their focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists have said that the claim that the new instant were more inflammatory than the communiqués issued more slowly, was a luddiste which would impoverish the policy of the future Court governing the media coverage of the trial.
But some lawyers have said that the courts of appeal étaitent often lured by the arguments that social and technological changes require an adaptation by the courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they are a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 who had overthrown the condemnation of Dr Sheppard in because of the media coverage of the trial, and they have said they invoqueraient the need for new rules for the new media.
"this case," écrivaient-ils ," is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21 th century."
The civility can bring the divisions?
After a campaign marked by invective and the negativity, a minimum of civility erupted in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation forward or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan fight in the sex-capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress has produced no breakthrough on the major issues that must be dealt with in the course of the "lame duck" session.
But, of course, there are at least had a polite discussion on the differences between the two parties, as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points. vacuum rating point supporter.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the Committee on the president's deficit was equally civilised, despite the political differences between the States.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect across the ideological divide, but which, however, still divides the members.
It is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of testing and of mutual test for signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants have unveiled a minimum requirements or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to suggest a rapid change of climate which has existed in the past two years.
Whether taxation, spending, health care or the rights, the two parties remain miles away.
However, the election of November had WCT-WPPT Washington, at least in the short term.
"there is no doubt that things have changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, an official of the Bush administration, now at the side of the Ethics and Public Policy Centre.
"it is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are causing partisan passions and, secondly, they are estomptent.
This is good. "
On some issues, including those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
The two sides to find a way to preserve some or all, of a permanent or temporary.
Similarly, a compromise is possible on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the administrations--Republican cannot afford to give the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while refusing the unemployment benefits to the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, more optimism over a possible agreement on the issues raised during the "lame duck" session, with the ratification of the pact "New START."
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, warned that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the session "blade duck" does not necessarily ménera to better understanding between the two parties when the 112 th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
"once the things that need to be made, the psychology in the short term will return to the behavioiural confrontations," he said.
Wehner has also expressed its scepticism widely shared that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between now and 2012 as a pré-spectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, at-il said.
The reasons are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and the voters at the tea who contributed to its creation.
However, the Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and to repeal the new health care law.
These lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Committee of the deficit which include to reform the tax code and to increase certain taxes, to raise the retirement age and reduce spending.
The co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, by themselves, imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the committee, composed of 18 members, to make their plan as an official recommendation, and they have struggled to reach this number.
The strongest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group, which suggests that there is on tax issues, today at least, little or willingness to compromise.
It provides for two phases in the fighting between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan battles, given that Republicans assail Obama in terms of budget, tax and health care; and then be followed by a period of bipartisan cooperation.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is demonstrated that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still wants to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as in 1995, then the two parties will look carefully at the public reaction.
Those who will be judged in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But this would be an optimistic point of view.
The partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990 s and it seems to be a more ideological splits between Obama and congressional Republicans than there were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the two parties activists see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on the part of both parties to find common ground on the issues that still divide.
The American documents disclosed describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a " Kleptocratie " and up to the Kremlin part of bribes and protection money, said the US embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge racketeering which helps to explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also of organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share so that money snakes to the top of the scale.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site.
The note is based on sources whose names have been cleared up.
It has been drafted while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption.
It has been dismissed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev but there has been little evidence of cleaning.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years, and he has won a libel case on these charges.
In September, he said to a Russian television station, when he was interviewed on a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is to throw, that is nonsense."
The Russians, by an overwhelming majority, believe that their society is corrupt; according to the polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of embassy; and it is incredible that this would be to diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the government of the city of Moscow and crime has led some people in the name of "dysfunctional" and to say that the government was working as a kleptocracy rather than a government, "according to the notes of the embassy.
"criminal elements" krysha " (a term used in the criminal world / the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Department of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as throughout the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the summit."
"the FSB, the MVD and militias are at the second level."
"finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"it is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report indicates that the FSB has earned the money of larger companies and that the police are targeting small.
A source, he said, "explained that business owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups) because, not only, they have more weapons, more resources and more power than the criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law."
"that is why the application of protection by criminal gangs is no longer as high."
The note said that, although the collection of money should be extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly see their close affairs under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has repeatedly addressed the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress.
The note of the embassy reports of men who bring suitcases, probably commercial-operation money, to the Kremlin.
In its fight against corruption, "Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"but it is part of this tape."
"it is not part of a political class because it is not happening in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption, to the whole of Russia, would amount to more than $300 billion per year.
The country was ranked 154 th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the US Embassy, which was carried out only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, remuera with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov, to a certain extent, can be blamed for the failures of Moscow, this could be the opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is in the process of resolving the problem.
Interviewed by CNN's Larry King, Putin has suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacturing and reacted with anger over what US diplomats had disclosed in the appellant Batman and Robin bringing Medvedev.
"the problem is based on the fact that it is our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"but to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to the ethics."
The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a poorly informed classroom with low-quality concrete walls warships, the director of secondary school of Anlong Veng referred to the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"everyone here like Ta Mok."
"it was a good leader; and it cared of its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years of age.
Known as "the butcher" for its brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge commander, remains popular in this isolated former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia where it has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, the longstanding loyalty is finally called into question at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of truth and reconciliation has allowed the victims to respond publicly to people who participated in the regime.
In June, the government has distributed a handbook of high school, for the first time, history teaches the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, together with the United Nations, made its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious torture centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the "Duch."
In this situation, the anxiety has increased among veterans of the Khmer Rouge Anlong Veng; making reconciliation efforts and their wills of Cambodian reintegrate into society.
"there is some resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"for them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"the situation creates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot-Unis in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army have fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they have launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran the guerrillas from their bases in the mountains of the West of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990 s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to make defection to the government, culminating with Ieng Sary capitulated in 1996 and of Nuon Chea and Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near to Dangrek.
He died in prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial.
Without their benefactors, most of the veterans of the Khmer Rouge have sunk into grinding poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many people are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite officers of the Khmer Rouge have kept their local leadership posts in exchange for tabling the weapons, it is unskilled farmers on low rank and file.
"these people have benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang Centre for justice and reconciliation which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"they are imbibés agrarian utopian ideology of the regime."
"they have been high in a framework where business is a foreign concept."
SOR Lim, 55 years of age, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, has fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before moving in 1998 as poor--but rice grower.
"life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"your Mok has everyone."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs. "
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the court should begin the judgement of Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith Khmer Rouge, another former minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes but he has not said if it went beyond these four cases.
More may be needed to calm the fears to Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former head of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970 s.
In 2007, she said researchers of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project which forced thousands of workers were killed.
Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem labour is the scope of its wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
While the sun scorched throwing long shadows on the grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his role in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court had convened, "she says, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," is there said.
"if there is more prosecution, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has done defection of Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court had several suspects; although the experts and historians disagree about that.
"Cambodia should dig a hole and bury the past, at-il said.
But the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, documentation centre.
"reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect the pieces," he says.
"we need to put these pieces together so that we can understand."
The center has produced the first handbook approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "A History of the Democratic Kampuchea regime, consisting of 75 pages."
It has distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history books of the Department of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 -year-old student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new manual helps students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted with scepticism when he returned home to study with the book.
"my family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"they are suspicious because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue."
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, "said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are beginning to have an impact, at-il said.
However, the Khmer Rouge to retain a powerful atrait here.
In the mountains of Dangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and littered with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of corrugated rouillée.
The body of Pol Pot was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, aged 31, a saleswoman of mobile phone roadside, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated at this location.
"but it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she says.
It was the anniversary of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk to the last resting place of Pol Pot, where it would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing the chance.
Belarus to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it would abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a key component for nuclear weapons; this décison is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Belarus Foreign Minister, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security.
The US government had tried for years to convince the Belarus to renounce the highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached the horizon last spring.
But US officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the past two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This has opened the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about 500 books, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it was good to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit of 2012 nuclear security summit."
"it proves that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for global security, a group of promotion of nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "very significant and important step" by Belarus.
Obama is committed to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation will never agree to its uranium.
"we have kept hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium, which is essentially of weapons-grade uranium and the low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko.
"it is our product... We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone."
"we are going to use it for research purposes, that is all."
The Belarus has moved to the United States a few months ago; however, expressing an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium of Belarus, in October, has been particularly complicated because the material was slightly spent, indicated.
It was posted on a special train which has more than 1 300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, said officials.
The second operation has been completed on Monday and was carried out by air, according to the officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of the Belarus with low-enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence, leading to the agreement signed by Clinton," said Andrew Bieniawski, an official from the Department of Energy Reduction of the Impending World.
According to estimates by the Centre for the Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relations between Belarus and the United States are strained for years, mainly due to the harsh repression by Lukashenko of Human Rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential revival.
"while welcomimg progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus were essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government has made no objection to the CIA flights
The government has made no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay has the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the United States ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks daily El País, who noted that the first Vice-President of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish executive is informed for "pouvoir' demonstrate that they have an adequate surveillance on foreign aircraft shipped across Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe which accused him of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, has been a meeting between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President has acknowledged that the report of the Council "had surprised the Zapatero Government offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide.
"de la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights by the Spanish territory."
"they only want to be informed" to avoid the "should," "says Aguirre in a cable.
This time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the holder of the ExternE Ministry told the ambassador that the Spanish executive "wanted to give this matter the looming as low as possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the Government had a limited ability to influence."
In turn, in January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González was sent to the Embassy that it did not block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Department of Defense on the CIA flights.
"these reports do not contain any incriminating element, any sensitive information," said the embassy after talking with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" more than for information déclassifiée INF o of the Ministry of Defence.
"this coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manoeuvre the case quietly between the Governments', regret Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the Minister of Internes, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are recklessly jealous of its independence and do what they consider," he had given instructions to its FoPs "to avoid the comments of an overheated rhetoric, in trying to rebaisser temperature."
The ambassador also expresses its concern for the PP's action in this matter.
"in spite of its general orientation, our experience suggests that PP26 certainly stands to gain from any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if révélations-là have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," her.

Ella complains: "If this is not, he should leave the boy with my mother, and I take when I come home," allègue-t-elle.
In May, it speaks of the rentr to his village: "This week I am leaving, but I will remain only until 19, because the 20 I have to submit to a position of work so as not to lose."
She explained that if everything was fine, it would have taken his mother with her.
"it will remain with the correct person, with me, and I will never leave my life with another person if the person is not my mother," dubious intent, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there is another post.
When the attack, the presumption is that the child, who came to the island on the 1 th of that month, and it had supposedly been murdered on 10, is dead.

The members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the SGP loses 9
With the results of the 18 -N, the PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant increase in votes and Members recorded in recent Catalan autonomous elections, the PP has already referred to the general because, even if there is progress or not, the outlook is more positive, because the number of votes that it is in these comices dual normally receives in Catalan.
Thus, the popular Catalan won 610,473 votes to 2008, while general autonomous of 2006, they were promised in 316,222.
On Sunday, the CPP has obtained 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, while a diversion of votes of the SGP and the retention of the electorate of the PP, the analysts have calculated that, if there would be general elections, the CPP could increased from 8 to 12 Members in Congress, while CiU in would also benefit four (it now has 10) and SGP would lose no more and no less than 9 Members (25).
These calcules will see that the Catalan place is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a Member - it now has three - during that COLI would keep a Member or would benefit.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May of 2011 for the comices municipal, where people can also be crucial to the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their heads of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - EUR 661 million for 2011 -.
Both the nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that CCS could lose the municipal authorities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the majority either the Socialists would get the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and COLI.
Taking into account the Republican debacle, it is not fanciful that it loses its representation in the town hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain 5% of votes-.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced of the fact that they may be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they have governed with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to CSP, including the mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they returned several times.
The popular have registered progress also in other important municipes as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
To date, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to lists in a maximum number of localities.
The Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three
The seven Pakistani and the Niger held by agents of the Police Information Commissioner General of Barcelona drew a jihadist cell, led from Thailand, helped the passports of the various groups Al Qaeda, "for the Earth Liberation Tamil Tigers (LTTE) " and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the Mumbai terrorist attacks which have caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internes has given great importance to these investigations, to ensure that with "Operation Kampai" was "stupidity" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at international level and "therefore, its operative capacity."
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years during which she has been active in Catalonia, has sent thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that included the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda for its "combatants" to cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell dismantled is the only that the jihadist network was operative in Europe, that is why in the investigation, participated in part of Thai services, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union there could be the following days of similar coups in the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani were detained Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Mohammad Iftikhar Ahmad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), Thailand has taken place, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were those who were in control since Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part was hit in 2009 - was stealing mostly tourists passports who satisfied the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front" appointed.
This made the documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without visas estampées.
The investigators noted that so far has found no detail that connects the detainees in Catalonia with the attack in Mumbai, even if the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the groups receivers of stolen passports in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless it should be recalled that a few days prior to the attack, of Catalonia has sent through a few miles company--to transfers of dollars that have been "invested" to buy mobile cards that have been used after by the so-called integrative "commando" that has killed 106 people.
The Police grabbed a lot of documentation.
PP Mas demand that it suspend the complicity tax
The leader of the MOB trade, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to Artur Mas its conditions to support his inauguration as President of the stretch, similar to those outlined during the campaign and which amount to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-souverainistes adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader would address to half of its mandate.
The President of the popular Catalan came at a meeting with Artur Mas with the safety of having won 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to make love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the training that will make the opposition refrain in the referendum of the investiture.
A possible agreement with the PP depend on the alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress for the general elections, but for the moment, the conversations Mas has these days with the rest of key political leaders are in Catalan.
And the chairman of the PP, to support a nomination "should eliminate all speech economic sovereignty and independence," and the complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader wishes even in the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their gamble to slim the apparatus of an administration policy autonomique very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax in succession and donations.
Details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will deal with the PC, Jordi Comet and Dolors Montserrat.
DSS already met with Joaquim Nadal (SGP), which has promised a tough opposition, Joan Herrera (COLI) and today it will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric contends that the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that night their nursing has killed more than 11 elderly
The Aprende geriatric The Caritat Olot yesterday (Gerona) offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, which has killed at least eleven elderly people which he was responsible in the meantime it has worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was accompanied by the centre's lawyer, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of The Caritat is likely to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" for the deaths, but "the legality and responsibility require us to assume the situation processuelle civic leaders."
And part of the social discrediting the entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the night nurses, the great threat to The Caritat now takes the form of an important that legal representatives of the victims' relatives calculate compensation already.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day has not ceased to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight body - former geriatric patients - care that in many cases no doctor Library organized died but, given the age and health of patients, the formality was conducted by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, flatly denied yesterday this situation and noted that "the lack of measures may have been in no time the cause of what happened."
Counsel for The Caritat added that "in this case it is only a hint of negligence on the part of any other person that is the accused."
The person already dubbed as "the Angel of Death" has confessed yesterday 11 murders and explained he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and one and a half months later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he has caused the death by injecting him a sobre-dose insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of pellets sedatives.
The director of The Caritat mentioned the fact that this is complicated to control centre staff access to medicines.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been in six of the nine crimes that, in its desire to alleviate the suffering of intra-concern, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses if Vila is not lying in saying that he has sought for his first victims a less cruel or death by contrary he burned inside by giving the laundry as he has already admitted that he has done with the three women he was killed in the range 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of night, the number of murders confessed, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is greatest and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of successfully kill after having committed eight murders.
That is why they say they will remain available to the court to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Trichet warned that investors have reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of yesterday "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
The peripheral differentials have closed to the strength and the actions of European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we must not underestimate the ability of the ECB and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a signal concerned.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way it collapses, it to recover, but motivated by very speculative short positions and fences.
The institutional investor takes to lose the fear.
A month ago, ECB has told us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain.
Bundesbank required the completion of the acquisition plan of public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unrestricted access to the week.
After the Irish crisis hope that it extends the current liquidity measures "until at least March" and maintain the quarterly auction to unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the program to purchase obligations and even give the signal to intensify.
If they do not comply with the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, God help us!
As well as during their meeting in May in which they said they did not even consider purchasing obligations and they have to fail the markets, history could repeat tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought much, resulting in a new market collapse.
Yesterday the auction of bills in a year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5.28% compared to 750 million in the previous 4.81% of the auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal declined 30 basis points across the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland they released the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated figures represent 10,000 million potential short-term and 15,000 and they have a deadline until February for private capital or they will be nationalized.
Even if Ireland has no credibility after not have detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will be subject to parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are an union and that all we interpret the same score.
The problem is that Germany wishes to interpret Wagner and the rest of the joy of Beethoven anthem.
In Spain, yesterday the President has had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will agree to Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment ring to the gills of investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The dual effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish stock market has suffered 4,5%, the double as the rest of Europe's stock exchanges.
In difference in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and radical and we have the surprise effect.
Today an enchère-clé obligation to three years ago got by Trichet, therefore we hope that it will be resolved with a strong demand and help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
To ask Spain for Assistance Plan would be an auto-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity, which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in available liquidity, the triple by transitant types, very expensive and they cut access to markets.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, ," the."
Courage, we can get out!
The president of Eulen dispute Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not end in the open conflict in the in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, founder of the group, dispute, as it considers "Low-Interest of law," the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, approached by five of his seven sons in which they will make their majority and take the management bodies of the holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José NeSS legal for the new chapter of their dispute for control of a group.
The founder of the largest holdings of business services to companies does not seem to be willing to cede in their dispute to be present in the bodies of El Enebro.
Its board of directors has been excluded by five of his seven sons who were appointed administrators in the shareholders' meeting of 18 January this year in which the dispute is registered in the Trade Register and companies.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrat Commercial Number 2 of Madrid, has opened up new Pandora's tonnerres within the Alvarez family.
The judge to set the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantee the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta, and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal of his five sons seekers to try, through a processuelle quibbling, clearly committing fraud against the Act and abusing the law, validate and correct the assembly radically zero on January 18," according to its official spokesmen.
This will be the basis for that, once the assembly, to be challenged in considering that it is "null."
The same players, who maintained a discreet silence, have already tried without success that the judge shall convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a file-access society and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the son of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group of services is seeking the establishment on 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This is the question that the judge must decide after the hearing on the request of protest for which there is not yet a date, reported.
Siemens Red Bull triumph in F1 with a secret weapon
A software creates improvements on cars in real time.
As soon as Red Bull tructurally entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this sélecte universe of the speed was marked by the surprise and the success.
In a first time, nobody has taken account of the options for a new stable that were to happen, despite the upward trajectory of recent seasons, the last November, in the last phase of the championship all have counted on the triumph of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without discounting the champion's skill as a pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, the ability of the Renault engine which drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 refers to the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn in a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful simulation software to process that the German company has launched on the market in 2007 with very distant goals of the High automobilistique competition.
Appointed PLM, electronic-data-processing-related powerful instrument has been used to create chains assembly factories fabricantes of everyone, of energy stations, of high precision instruments.
The objective is faithfully reproduce, simulate the product or process before the building of a real way, thus avoiding the defects and avoidable costs.
Plm facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or of Nissan's most famous vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this instrument technology in its plant in Formula 1 Red Bull to create and execute "in the coming hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the Augean 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams that was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today are 180 young professionals of high qualifications, equipped with powerful computer equipment are tall, any kind of changes on the speed-enthused.
The leader of Siemens explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all the elements of speed-enthused Red Bull except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
We change the materials, the fuel, aerodynamics and security features.
The changes may pass from the virtual reality simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves.
As single limitation of this madness of technological development there is the amount of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 may spend as limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has established the factory of high technology to create and speed-enthused in a town 50 miles from London.
These are two buildings where the visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that is happening there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this duty has 580 people, ci-inclus two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the technological resources that the mark of energy drinks has the benefit of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and the fame no.
The director of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago you could say that the progress of R + D in the case of racing cars were making the 50% of victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents the 85% of success, while the pilots provide 15% of the value added.
Nevey admit that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP come in two 20 s own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) has opened its first store in Barcelona exclusive in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 businesses between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain during the next two years.
The company will this initiative with the 16 areas that are already in multi-brand sales centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte store.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the revised store located on the Gran Vía Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which it 30 years that it works.
The North American group has prepared a plan to bring 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013, which includes the Spanish 20 establishments.
The first open were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the Barcelona Process is the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the possible next stores, even if it has confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The head of personal HMS systems has ensured that the philosophy for the location of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advise and exclusive deals with the design of the furniture stores (with products that can be affected in an interactive way), which held an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers staff training establishments.
Helena Herrero has denied that it is a system of frankness and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims to "improve the service to clients and SMEs in the purchase, the assistance, the post-vente and even the packaging."
The store of Barcelona includes a pioneering space with a pilot programme to global level that solves the possible problems of HP computer equipment.
An online service connects with a technical centre in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"thus, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take two days."
"this system is designed specifically for the MPEs and users, because the big companies have already contracted services of technical assistance," remarked yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bet on stealing a million customers to rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the deputy head delegate of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejected a new liquidity crisis and predicted the end of the war liabilities.
Despite this, it provides a collapse of interest margins, that we will try to offset some with incréments of committees and the price of credit.
Sabadell look capture in three years a million retail customers, its task.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit during the future three years and to be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank will set in motion in 2011 a new management plan which will hold a will labilité of three years.
The objective, in part to survive without the need for public subsidies of FROB, is to win a rating of market by harnessing a million new retail customers - 700,000 if you deducted those who are able to get out of the banque-, its great task, because until now the bank had ruined more SMEs and that the particular client companies.
This year it has collected 250,000 retail customers and 50,000 companies.
His ratings of individuals market is 3.5%, while the companies it exceeds the 10%.
Another 2011-2013 plan is the gamble on productivity, or what is the same thing, austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, the provocations of which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few other banks now dare to set targets and the public do, because the financial crisis has caused concern among all the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise its master plan this year Optima, sets out four years ago, although initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined the extension for a year.
The clients who escape the coffers of savings will be its main objective.
During a breakfast organized by FIPA, Guardiola has insisted on the fact that 2011 will be a difficult year "and overwhelming."
The executive, in fact, think that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, has insisté-t-il.
And even if he thinks that the war liabilities - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and building societies pay for its emissions for liquidity are already moving to the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"the aspect of the liquidity and funding is structural and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"we do not have tightened the tap, but the differentials are higher," acknowledged Guardiola.
BANESTO has already given orders to its network of limiting the long-term credit and increase the price differentials - see 22 and 27 November- CincoDías.
He also admitted that the trend of the banking sector now "is to increase the committees," but "there is a competitive framework."
The master plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
This is not in vain that it ensures that Spain "will be asked of larger dimensions."
"next year," assuré-t-il move.
He says that the needs of capital "leadership role" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he noted that the FROB can replace the market in the diversion of funds in the case of new recapitalization.
After having assured that Sabadell can survive in the temporal closure of the markets, it has diminished the importance of the fact that some predict a new banking crisis of liquidity.
But on the contrary of what happened in June, GIHR cannot provide the short-term funding can be obtained through rest, which dampens the crisis.
ECSC rejected the possibility of a second wave of mergers among Pe9014.htm
The Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new wave of mergers Pe9014.htm of savings and insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, there have been several entities who have ensured that they did not participate in this first phase and reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Confederation of Spanish Savings Banks Group of Épargnes (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations.
"I think most of the mergers, we cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group have Cívica a second phase, adjustments."
"most has been completely; it is possible that instead of 17 to 13 or 14, but all major processes have been made already under the tutelage of the Bank of Spain, which also has worked a lot in this operation," said the leader.
In the statements for a breakfast meeting of the Association of Dirigeants and Exécutifs of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta argued that the process of concentration "to the greatest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way that it is within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," emphatisé-t-il.
"the mark of 45 Pe9014.htm with an average of 28,500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a trial without equal in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much more big to be consistent in Basle," souligné-t-il.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a series of opinions not very happy about the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of sérosité and meaning," because "what the Bank of Spain does is remind you that we must respect the deadline before the end of the year."
"probably" the Director General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of the whole of Europe and the world and he attributed to people who cast doubt on a "lack of knowledge."
The leader said that given the current economic situation, "we can be very satisfied" with the situation of financial entities and savings banks, a system which has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes to the greatest possible speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has come out well of the stress tests that ECB has made in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but he established the conditions for the entire Union.
Market tensions have led to a llama doble government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or removal of EUR 426 in aid for the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% of AENA, Barajas airport management and El Prat and 30% of the State Loteries.
On the other, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe González, with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism in regard to its responsibility to post the current crisis.
How are these movements?
It should be noted that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its forthcoming policy.
On the contrary, it is another limitation of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which shocked with that to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, in Germany we are starting to speculate on the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of Mark, even if it seems of science fiction, with a very favourable tide of opinion, nearly a 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines on countries that break, of a possible suspension of payments and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it's been a long time that it is now, therefore there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF as the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of difference between what Germany felt that we needed to do (fiscal austerity plans and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-inclut France, practised.
The second Central European countries was when Merkel has hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From then on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel expresses a clear position again, in calling for the reform of the Treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and force at the same time to private lenders to contribute to the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has left the Irish crisis and the rest.
But its proposal, although watered down a little, has been approved and, the following month, we should see the process of reform of the Union that these measures from 2013.
Germany has outlined a red line that it does not think cross.
And she tells us that, even if we must take measures with which it is not too agree, as of that date, the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will see the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries which contravene the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default and, in this case, the private sector will also be a party of the costs.
Germany tells us that we must follow a strict growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and the construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one who chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated.
The development is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear.
It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we are being asked for is much harder.
And what they must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence happen to us a greater tranquillity.
And that we can seize the opportunity that we were given, in the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and its dual statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it opened the way to the theory that park.visitation.continues.to.decline, .probably.due.to.a. agenda at home.
But the red line that Germany has mapped out is, and they do not seem to move.
And among the possibilities that, we cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary zone too chock-full of countries seriously.
And in this case, Germany we can always say that she had warned.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show the ingenuity but not the desire to escape punishment.
The expulsion conversation in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink on the anti-sportif nature of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before completing the match (clearly that their team already earned), the two players have deliberately lost the time when they have made mistakes in determining the referee to show them the second yellow card.
As well, and given that Real Madrid will eventually be leader of his group, the two players, will take the XVIII. regulatory dam during the next game of the match against Auxerre and can go ahead without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the discipline committee of UEFA has punished with two matches the coach of the team, Mourinho and different economic are the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in www.eumc.eu.int or similar circumstances is not a new practice, www.oag-bvg.gc.ca rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, Asia, but of the sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case say is due to the fact that this has had as a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem nobility and the honour and which in the past Opportunitites players were fined for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it appears, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to its inflated history of technician histrionique and provocative.
In any case, the debate whether this type of behaviour not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e., if with these actions committing a fraud of law; because, in fact, they are friendly actions with the sporting regulation, but seem to avoid.
The question is to look at the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods which includes the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that, with these actions has not been put in danger, there was no violent game.
Another of these goods that we talk with the proper game is that the team of players infracteurs unfairly take advantage of the opposite team, which is not the case.
The paradoxical fact of Real Madrid players, however, is that it does not accept that is normally characterised as cheating o fraud of the law, because its violation of rules has not been conducted behind closed doors to try to avoid the penalty, but their action has tried to be as clear as possible to receive the penalisation of the referee.
They expected and they have gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the kind of advantage that the infracteurs receive the mistakes people.
Here it seems necessary that we do not put at a disadvantage to rival and has an advantage in the same match, because obviously the result of the action from their own team with fewer players.
And this is not an useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not count on these players.
Obviously the advantage lies in the fact that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that can threaten their future participation in a match.
But it is a long-term benefit, with a degree of ambiguity, because the team could be eliminated all of a sudden and, with this action players perform a match of XVIII. and spend the second round of boxes, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cards is with a less than in the first round.
So that, climb to the top, this is not so clear that this is an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is still part of strategic decisions that promote the maximum advantage of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players have not set up to avoid the application of the penalty (it would be a clear case of fraud), otherwise they chose the moment in which they are subject to it.
They have made a strategic decision without disrupting the penalty or flee.
Even if the border between the engineering and fraud of the law is A-GG-, in this opportunity I think that there has been a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, is due to two factors: because there were two auto-expulsions and because of the way of conveying the Executive Director for the cause.
The damage caused to the principles of ethical sport by these actions is not as much as aesthetic.
Offensive NCB offered for Christmas dinners for groups in
The dictatorship of the timetable is focusing this year an avalanche of bookings for the 16 and 17 days.
There is a proliferation of self-financing celebrations by employees who wish to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the nougat and the lottery, when December is also are the groups before the Christmas dinner who continue to be the lifeline for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of the crisis have lead in an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 terminaisons dinners or meals, businessmen and the sector associations interviewed.
Complicating the accounting, the timing of this year to complete (as on New Year's Eve falls on Friday) made the claims in the week of December 13, with the result so far an avalanche of dinners bookings for the peak days (17 and 17) and almost nothing the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of the difficult times, but there are many companies which have eliminated the collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees do pay for it out of their own pockets.
Any is the economy, they all apply price of battle, confirms the president of Gremi Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employer, now, does not dare to predict how will the feast-days this month.
"people give much thought before."
"they want to leave but they pay much attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at a reasonable price and with a good service," he says, and customers have the tendency to take a level with the crisis, so that the Monday-to-Sunday around EUR 25 has become the largest in the application.
In a survey of the various institutions of the welCANADA centre of the collapse of applications for the night of 17.
The group Soteras indicates that there is a real boom of applications for this vendredi-là, with the desire to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economy, with full formulas from EUR 25 to EUR 35.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 schools in the city (Hostal of Rita, Market, The Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the timetable has assumed more advance bookings, even at the beginning of November.
"we have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes of EUR 19.95 to 30," détaillent-ils.
Year Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, local QuQu and a total of 23, remains optimistic after detected a strengthening of the billing since the second half, although concentrated, and good prospects for the Christmas.
The sources of the group indicated that the 18 will also be a day hyper-actif in groups of friends who are celebrating in advance feast-days.
To their six group they have added a menu for the noël, with EUR 30 or more as famous budget and the perception of that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as the Catalan wine made according to the method champenoise - cava.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies require their employees and the feeling that the volume of groups has increased somewhat.
On the part of employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Divertissement of Barcelona), Vice-President, Enric Gomà, says in the opportunity to begin to see the end of the tunnel and argues that overall bookings are "lively," even if customers "are negotiating at maximum."
This is true, the hope in regard to the festivities has not declined, regardless of who pays, "he said.
The Pakistani nuclear program generates a great concern in the U.S.
Islamabad product of atomic weapons to "a faster pace than any other country."
The filtrations Wikileaks confirms to the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the United States Department of State filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous preoccupation in Washington on Pakistan's nuclear program.
Apart from the details revealing and tasty offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear safety, instead of increasing, "decline" and that the unstable Asian country producing nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assemblies, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make difficult destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
That is how the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of former National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear installations of the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferation-proof and a reason to maintain custody.
"Pakistan has to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear or missile programmes" the expert said Yuri Korolev, of the Ministry of Externes Russian during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high degree of production of nuclear armas.
A report by the Embassy in May, which describes as "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; the offers of help remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan producing nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also calls in Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, he made it "very clear" to "the Pakistan Army must come with the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama nombrera to a high responsible for the fight against terrorism in order to avoid the new infiltrations.
Interpol makes a red alert to track the movements to Assange.
All the aspects linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday Interpol has issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements of Assange."
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, but it datte on 20 November.
And it has nothing to even with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, counsel creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 international police force with the headquarters in Lyon (France) has dictated the agenda to request of Sweden, but he has not made public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of this country.
As well, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "for his arrest provisionnelle and his extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the order to arrest a person affected by a red alert, many member countries, according to the explanations of the organization, consider the appeal red notice a free lane for the arrest and the police - the national body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange.
The movement was outraged to Assange's lawyers, who have published a letter dénonceant yesterday that the WikiLeaks founder, 39 years, has shown itself willing to answer questions via video-conference.
They also recall that Assange has sought and obtained the prosecutor's permit to get out of Sweden, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
"it seems to be a fighter, not a legal persecution," denounces the missive.
As the world seeks - and Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in a place not unknown, but it is silent.
On Monday he gave at an unknown location an interview to the Director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"if we can show that it was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates that they épient at the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he says.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who has described as "ridiculous and absurd" calling for the resignation.
"I am not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should focus," déclaré-t-il for CNN.
Obama himself has appointed a High Commissioner of combating terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The test of President Barack Obama's spokesman to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, Congressman from January will chair the Committee of National Security in the Dutch Lower Chamber has asked the Department of State it is studying the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate its funds and continue to any person who provide contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an adviser of the Canadian chairman Stephen Harper, who has come back to his statements after he said that Assange will "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into objective and use a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who has not asked for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-gouverneur of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and everything that is not an execution would be too kind a punishment," déclaré-t-il for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with people at the followers of Carod
The Republican leader will give the party a secret voting on its continuity.
Huguet executive proposes a more diverse and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for solving the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware of the fact that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as watered down as a liar and that it could not give him headaches that he had with other pds.td.silk.org.
That is why the leader of, Esquerra will win its critics with an eye to shield people until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to decide on its continuity in secret.
By ballot papers, not in your hand.
If the carodistes want to convey a certain penalty vote to the President, they will be able to do without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he does not consider ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a Bulgarian outcome "to the" would be good.
People close to Carod require a little more than the president put its position of the anti-European, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós control the maxim body between the congress.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to agree a road map with the executive until May.
For that, they hope to participate in the drafting of the document to strategic reorientation that management will submit to the station of the National Council on 18.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of AJB00 the congress for the autumn of 2011, what the leaders see as a fact.
The leader of ERC admitted that the "chorus" affects the stability and that its objective is done only once and for all the organization is able to wash his laundry room in family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it is as if had been.
And it has listed five, it highlights two.
The first, "reintegrate" the executive for it represents at least 90% of the anti-European, i.e., new figures from the proponent of sector Carod.
The second may be the nature of news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid to once and for all the assembly as operating mechanism.
Thus, it represents a fundamental reshaping of statutes that enables the achievement of delegates elected by direct suffrage through Congress.
Do away with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which already has fought in the last two congress.
In fact, the convulse 2008 conclave instructed management to revise the model assembly in a special congress of land of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, because the internal tide of last years did not recommend deal with this issue.
Now, without critical sectors to the lookout, the time could be good for the resume and the close forever.

"it (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect which has never been on the table of negotiation, at least for the moment, this has been an approach for the local elections which has been successful and has achieved its objective," mentionné-t-il.
The leader paniste mentioned that NAP is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not afraid; on the contrary" we relish and makes us stronger, "déclaré-t-il.
He said that the Board will élégir the best leader whose Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, it would give the matter "to the person determined by the Board."
"I am completely clear and open, I would be proud to leave the office of President of the party at any of the five."
It is expected that the recovery by the party's participation in the elections of 4 July will be looking at the next dispute, although "this is not the time to think about 2012."
"for the moment it is accompanied by the Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments who are alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that one is "a lot of confidence in this, and I am sure that Gabino will be equal to the expectations."
When asked about the criticism of MICs against President Felipe Calderón because of his speech during his four years of government, priistes Caesar Nava asked to reflect on the six years of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari administrations.
"if the PRI believe that the governments of Zedillo, Salinas was better than those of Fox is Calderón; they are beginning to defend; they come out of bed," he says.
He said that the holder of the federal executive can make expressions such as those he has made in his speech in the Auditoire National, because in the country there is no gags, and even less of censorship.
Obama civilian-to-military Twitter the law in favour of undocumented students
"if you agree with the approval of the Act tracks Act, is life senators and demande-leur to approve this legislation," Twitté the American president in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama is meeting today to the national mobilization to support the Act tracks Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.

His short message maintains opened a cyber link with a broader document which asks the public to contact senators immediately, because the legislation is imminent.
"with a vote that we hope soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators have threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the Bush era tax cuts and government funding to continue.
Such a deadlock, announced in a letter signed by 42 senators administrations--Republican, could affect the vote of the Act tracks Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blocking the Act tracks Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that it is confidant that once the fiscal problem is resolved will set an agende for the rest of the projects.

The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would seek a "vote of closure of the debate" in the Act tracks Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be the next week.

The Democrats, the majority of which supported the team Act, have 58 seats.
But at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican has expressed its support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the team Act require the vote of several other Democrats chose to vote against administrations--Republican if the initiative.
Between Republicans courted there are senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, Maine, and the outgoing senator George Lemieux, of Florida, who completed the mandate process--the Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported in the past the team Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, of Texas, but they said they did not support another opportunity.
Another Republican who has supported, John McCain, has not defined its position until now.
Even if the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree with the fact that the team's biggest obstacles Act in the Senate.
With the literature itself puts the nail on the head
The second stage of the language has been a walk in Plaisirs which participants flexed the narrative
"sex in the language, I understand, but... the nail on the head? that hopes to me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the language Plaisirs, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and this time has used the subtitle of his question (for another round the table was committed to fair Sexe in the language, expliqué-t-elle).
The nail on the head ..." is an embarrassment," slowly has launched the Argentine writer to the public, most young people, who had gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to listen to this small table by Marisol Shultz and Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela has read a text for Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after as a great history, with Luisa in first person as a leader who wants to know what is the "scourge," it goes to a doctor to another, without a response, only in the same narrative thread.
The infectiologue it convinced: "patience is not my strong, it is perhaps my head."
In the end, after a frustrated with the approach traumatologue which has cut the breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychanalyste reveals the mystery: "is what is open in reality, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist soupirât relieved and concludes: "on and I have only been able to know that it is that is open, and that it does not exist," but convinced of the fact that the pleasures and pitfalls of the language must be very interrelated.
Valenzuela, the writer, has played with the two.
The Nicaraguan citizens Sergio Ramírez has carried out a delightful narrative that it was entitled, to the invention, where the finger on the wound is not nombré but at a given moment is discovered.
With overtones of magic realism, it speaks of a famous ensorceleuse was on clouds, return of people who had gone far or réparait virtues that damoiselle had lost, a narrative that before we talk about America turns, the news that took from the beginning its own columnists and do well to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who is critical of the excesses of the narratives of capitans conquerors.
"Cervantes who we all invented (writers) made fun of false witnesses who appear in the stories presented as a real, but aitre way we would never conté America's history with an imagination that lack of shame '.
Nevertheless, has souligné-t-il, "the madmen and the liars have the best imagination" and by the good--a reality with the lie, we no longer know how much of the narrative belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction peaked.
It's called in the tradition of Cervantes.
"it is thanks to his legacy is what the story."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table The must on the head.
The Cubaine-portoricaine puts his own on the great social scourge of violence that his country is - and Latin America share - product of trafique disputes and the sale of drugs.
"I think the proper literature, poetry good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," indiqué-t-elle, after mentioning the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment between the author and readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction."
The evening is over with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also emphasized "must on the head of the writer."
It considered that in a world which lives in high-speed also concern the intellectual habits and the control of consciences that work to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind each claim there is a small and behind each denying there is a small yes."
"to be the masters of our own feelings and be the masters of the reality, we must qualify: and nuance means many times put the nail on the head and disturb people who feel very comfortable in thinking in caricature, in black and white, established ideas and without nuance and also disturb the powers who prefer a world in black and white," he says, to recapture the sense to write.
Romano hunting his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the final he had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, in addition, there are two different styles themselves, marked by their technicians, who find them a sharp contrast with the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in the final, it has had ups and downs in his career, but he has been able to achieve three times the decisive series, although so far it has not hit the mark and that is why this is a very special occasion for him.
The Argentine has to be content with the coin of sous-champion, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously consecutive final with the same team he has played.
The strategist santiste arrived at its first final as entraineur in the Tournoi Call 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he has lost with an overall score of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Closing it happened at the decisive duel and lost again with the overall outcome of 3-1 and this was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournoi Bicentenaire 2010, against the Diablos, Rubén has suffered a setback, because his team has done an equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of the game, but in the series of penalties he received an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to finally get the title and three of his players have missed 11 metres and he has suffered the leap of 4-3.
Rubén has lost two final with the Diablos Rojos and with Monterrey, his rival in the tournament, therefore it does not have the same fate, he tries to let go of the curse to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although it says that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I do not want to break no statistics, this is for a club, not for a passion, and therefore I will obtain the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when he was asked what would be its weak points in the final.
He remembers a lot of the final last, of which it ensures that he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee blows the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match cannot celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry, because it says in its players: "We never seeks to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish in the regular time, but sometimes we have that we prepare, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately the fate we sometimes made a wrong turn, these are the emotions or the anguish to take the title in our hands, hands we escaped, it served as a lesson for us this final and we hope that there is more in this position."
Romano now has the opportunity to be a technician sous-champion and for the first time the glory of the securities.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The space agency of the United States has cited the press to be presenting a discovery that will have the impact on the research of living in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will tomorrow, Thursday, a discovery astrobiologique, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.

It appears that there is talk of a microbe discovered at the bottom of Mono Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, who lives in an ambient that it was too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsénique.
In any form, the creature uses the arsénique as a way of life and that leads us to believe that a similar life could exist on other planets that have not our atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologistes, if these agencies use the arsénique in their metabolism, this proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different than we are."
The space agency will contact the true scope of discoveries in the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be the géobiologie Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the largest satellite of Saturn), under the prospect of its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were conducted in the Eastern Townships, Wednesday, in the framework of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that were used in the production of drugs.
"approximately 750 plants of cannabis, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment that were used to production have been seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Sûreté du Quebec.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including two heads alleged leaders of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The people arrested were to appear at the Palace of Justice in Sherbrooke in the hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches took place as the result of a lengthy investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"this is information received from the public which has enabled us to make these arrests," said Mr Ruel.
Some 70 police officers on Regional module in the Eastern Townships of the Sûreté du Québec, of the Police Service of Sherbrooke and the Régie de police Memphrémagog, police took part in this operation.
Illegal migration will continue without problem
The Conservatives who, according to the government, Bill should solve the problem of the vessels responsible for illegal migrants, will obviously be beaten while the three opposition parties have indicated on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I am firmly based on the Charter."
"I am standing with a party that has created the granite stones taken under your feet," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was surrounded by Members after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals argue that the bill as proposed, which would hold a year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, has also indicated that it could not support the bill, because it is the wrong target.
"we are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," said Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of the NDP on immigration, Olivia Chow, has discounted the criticism that his party is not tough enough on illegal immigrants.
"the New Democrats agree to take measures against smugglers of illegal immigrants and that is what we are doing through another bill, C- 35," said Mrs Chow.
"we do not support the bill of the Conservatives because it takes to refugees and imprisons children for at least a year," said Mrs Chow.
The immigration minister Jason Kenney, has accused the opposition parties to play politics and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"Canadians overwhelmingly say that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations targeting Canada and which treat the country as a doormat."
"they expect Canada take firm action," the Minister responded Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on his bill, which could have brought the country to elections in its rejection.
A conservative QMI Agency has however said that the government would seek a vote for every Member who oppose is then explained to the electorate.
The new unit is not unanimously
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, argues that this idea is not new: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York since January.
The mainland has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, Tuesday's announcement has surprised.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on police services in Quebec, on 29 October last year, this measure has never been discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It does not require more critical for the péquiste public security, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement as "rabbit out of a hat" and "cobbled solution on the corner of a table."
The Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"you will see the result when we will announce, simply contente-t-il."
"we are aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQs, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public inquiry.
"Mr Charest is determined not to create this committee of inquiry, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he said.
"the only way to have a committee of inquiry, that is the resignation of Jean Charest," says Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to break this impasse, therefore, it suggests Quebec to give a special mandate for the Auditor General to investigate the collusion and corruption.
"we must be able to extend the mandate of the Auditor General," tranche-t-il.
It also believes that Quebec could give the auditor with the same powers as a Commissioner, thus enabling it to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squads is not the only project in the government's portfolio Charest.
Quebec would also in Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of Operation Sledgehammer, which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently focuses on certain amendments relating to this issue.
With Operation Spring 2001, affecting the motorcycle groups, even if the Criminal Code was not appropriate, 131 people have been arrested.
Ottawa was subsequently established on gangsterism.

Dupont partially blamé
The Quebec radio personality Stéphane Dupont has undergone a partial setback to the Canadian Council of broadcasting standards (non-CCNR) for controversial remarks on social assistance and the Haitians and on its crude on-air language.
The non-CCNR judge that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians and rude language which is not the broadcasts during the day."
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the names of two people who had taken their own lives, do not have violated the codes on broadcasting.
The non-CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint of the Common Front of social assistance recipients of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the show were inaccurate.
The facilitators must submit solid information rather than misleading.
On suicide, the facilitator Stéphane Dupont had estimated that suicide is a gesture of cowardly.
The majority of the members of the Committee have concluded that the message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution to the problems of life.
"the majority of the Committee considers that the episodes of" Dupont noon "have touched a sensitive issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
No blame has been accepted.
The last was statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Mr Dupont and Jean-René Dufort media were delivered to a showdown privately-retained reaction.
The facilitator of CHOI said that there was no donation to help Haitians because we could not know with certainty that the really needy people would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already served my suspension of three days."
"my record is free for a year and a half," said the facilitator.
In all the decisions PRGAA denounces the dissemination of rude language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM worked "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station which, among other things, must announce these decisions once during prime-time hours within three days.
A king of the kung-fu in Montreal
The Montréal of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has a very particular journey.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing gets on the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to play the martial arts as the kung-fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the mainland since 2008 to develop among professionals."
"in my case, I am looking for fighting everywhere, as for those who do not like the game ground-firing present mixed martial arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, anyone who has worked as a security officer and as a clerk for the company UPS has issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the finals of the amateur world of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing, he explained."
"currently, I am preparing to go to China for the World Cup of san shou."
"those who have finished in the top four at the last World Cup in each category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"in 2005, in Vietnam, I have finished eighth."
"in 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament in the fifth, when I came in third in Toronto in 2009, he added."
"what is interesting is that I have made to each competition."
"at this rate, I will be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where fisticuffs, and that ground-firing projections, are allowed.
The duels originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The battle is the American pugiliste from this form of Vietnamese origin Cung The, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly its presence to the "King Sanda" super tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"this competition is the most prestigious more raised and in China, explained the sympathetic gaillard."
"this is the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee (the biggest stage of Thailand)."
"that was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semi-finals of its category (80 kg), before losing the final.
"anyone who has defeated me was a true pro, he analysed."
"there are four combatants by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"the winners of the semi-final games are in their final category."
"then, the winners of each category face to crown a champion alone, the King of kung-fu."
450 million in contracts
OTC Hydro-Québec was awarded $450 million in contracts to firms for the Eastmain- 1 hydroelectric project -A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium of OPI firms, Dessau, SM Group and Axor which won the most important, the stewardship of the project, for a total of $295 million without tender.
This consortium called Energy Stewardship was established in 2004 associated with the choice of going private sector hydroelectric its responsibility to manage this important project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium to pick up the lucrative contract without competitive bidding.
For the Parti Quebecois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that risk to eliminate competition and lead to a rise in the price.
"it is the new way of making the collusion and to eliminate competition."
"that is, people, instead of that of secret, now openly," said yesterday the Member péquiste Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard has raised the issue in the National Assembly because it said see how the public interest can be used in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, vigorously denied that there was collusion for this contract.
"I am beginning to have my trip," she complaining, claiming that the PQ had had been "dishonest" and had "lacked rigour."
She said that "it would be the least" that the PQ subsequently apologizes.
The consortia formula is a common practice in the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance to two or more companies to combine their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The project Eastmain contains a high level of complexity in view of the scale of the work.
The shipyard is underway and must continue until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition to act; there were negotiations.
Also, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the last week revealed Le Devoir, the formula of the consortia in the sector of the génie-conseil investigated in government.
A quick overview of the register of Quebec firms will count more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Thus, the firm Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, CIMA +, Génivar, PAE and other Tecsult and Roche.
Each combination, and there are dozens, down to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
As regards the consortium stewardship, the Energy Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the James Bay responded to particular dynamics of workforce and Hydro-Québec is responding in particular since the 70 s."
The boss of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the James Bay Power Corporation (SEBJ), gave an explanation which was batting on the fact that the contract of stewardship of the project has been granted awards.
"if you're going to tender and that there is little of bidders, your price will be higher."
"you have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"but the idea is that this is not the price which is important, it is the competence of the people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract is awarded to the Energy consortium stewardship is part of a long list of contracts Parti Quebecois of more than $50 000.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Quebec and SEBJ for the Eastmain- 1 project -A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification, Le Devoir has arts-sector 109 génie-conseil contracts issued to between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, including laboratories of soil.
PAE has swept 22 contracts, Génivar had 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They account for 449 783 $344, including the contract to Energy Stewardship $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (OPI, Dessau, SM Group and Axor) are "well known to the Quebec Liberal Party."
The Minister Normandeau that the PQ subsequently is also linked to these firms that finance ,"" before it was more of its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer makes very little confidence to the sustainable development, but also fair trade marks and qualifications écologisantes to guide their choices.
Worse, even if he lives in a media universe where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption are rampant, there is a lack of credible information, a failure that he calls of brake on its commitment, indicates the Baromètre of responsible consumption, the first reading was delivered yesterday.
Even if they have increased the so-called socially responsible consumption of products in 2010, Quebeckers appear to give very little credit to those who are trying to sell.
Two thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental performance of companies like green advertising companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Monitoring Centre of responsible consumption of Sherbrooke University.
Another observation: half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official qualifications secured to the so-called fair products, but also of the credibility of products and brands become as parties involved, Baromètre.
In the same vein, the politicians' rhetoric on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this information currently part of the lively consumption by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of the information calmeraient the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Baromètre, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are well-publicized alleged performance of green products or services sought to put in the hands.
On another note, consumers have been nearly half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all changed one or more products to meet their conviction.
Up to 61%, they have also fostered purchases from traders of their neighbourhoods and privileged the purchase of food products grown in their region, Baromètre.
Greener and responsible - CWGBI of responsible consumption reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homo consumus Quebec likes to present himself as the king of recycling which seeks to reduce its environmental footprint in concerned about the protection of animals.
But its social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside of his car, Baromètre indicates: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers indicated using public transportation or have advocated green car-pooling to defend their interests.
Walking and cycling have also been supported by 39.1 percent of the participants in this vast behavioral investigation, which has just taken its first cliché.
A loan of the state for the redemption of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who were asked to commit financially in the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris by Angus and the Parallèle, agreed to work together, but only to a loan.
The Angus Development Corporation and the Parallèle, who had expected a donation of seven million dollars of the Ministry of Culture to buy at Daniel Langlois eXcentris film the complex on the Boulevard St. Lawrence River in restoring its full cinéphilique vocation, not getting what they wanted.
The government is willing to get involved in the file, but on its own terms.
Rather than expected the donation, the Quebec government proposes a loan, the amount of which would be lower than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to conditions of competition, at least in the view of sources from the headquarters of the state.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the demands have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and a plan of action have been sent to the Minister St. Pierre by the chairman of the Development Corporation of cultural businesses (provincial), François Macerola, leading the eXcentris.
It gave him a final report about ten days ago.
But the cabinet counter-proposal came to the SODEC Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond.
However, it seems that the assumption of the donation of the State should really be ruled out.
It should be noted that the Association of Quebec cinéparcs cinema owners and opposes a direct investment of the state to support the redemption of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance building projects, it has not done for other cinemas.
But several stakeholders have a substantial economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, for ten years highly committed the cinema in its premises of the complex after having financed itself its construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Board.
The lack of context--specifically for independent films in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini, Kingdom--which, for their part, a campaign of private funding, hoping to collect $700 000 to push the wheel of the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, one of three screens, The Parallèle, continues to spread eXcentris films.
Acquires the aim is to reopen the three context--specifically on 27 February, projecting the wonderful film of Xavier Beauvois Cost-management men and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini has not recalled Le Devoir and it is not known what he and his group think downward proposals.
The veil lifted on a Canada complexé...
The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lifted the veil on what the United States as the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but they are indicative of the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Thus, American diplomats are amazed that every Canadian elector was not the Canada-U.S. relations in the spirit in voting and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government to get its budget in 2009.
The four new communications between the US Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, plastered on the public yesterday, allow more titbits that substantial content to eat.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in the midst of a federal election campaign, tells how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the astonishment of the US ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation.
"a Canadian inferiority complex almost inherent is perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of the day rather than to make this election about the United States (as in the campaign on free trade of 1988)," he writes.
The United States are therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The ambassador understands even less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this critical relationship should be a key factor that the voters have in mind by voting."
Another expression of that feeling of importance reads in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, in Ottawa, President Barack Obama preparing for his first visit to Ottawa.
"your trip will help to ensure the survival of the government at the beginning of February vote of confidence on the federal budget, for which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan of $30 billion to $40 billion," Mr. Breese writing.
Nowhere does it say that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and the opposition parties made conditional survival to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington to the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC point of the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about the emissions Border, Little Mosque the out, Intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or abductions by the CIA for interrogation.
Another cable said that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some of the prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of "case by case basis."
At the end of the meeting, writing, "he submitted a paper to the Secretary of State of Omar Khadr, a 15 -year-old Muslim Canadian."
"the secretary has agreed to review the matter."
Finally see that get on the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, very close to Stephen Harper, a former adviser on the CBC said that the head of this mass exodus should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
The United Nations has proposed yesterday in Cancún a renovation plan for the industrial, commercial and domestic lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), which represents a third of the additional reduction that remains to be done to stabilize the climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the process of large concrete projects that the United Nations hope to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments by industrialized countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs that still monopolise from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluorescents or, better, light bulbs by light bulbs to light-emitting diodes (LEDs or "LED" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (gigatonnes GHG) expressed on the planet for humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That is the equivalent of 70% of global emissions of the cars.
In Copenhagen, the last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, engaged in voluntary plans that should put the global emissions of greenhouse gases to 53 gigatonnes to 49 gigatonnes.
But still it out of this 5 gigatonnes by 2020 in order to stabilize the rising to 2 degrees Centigrade climate in order to avoid it gets out of control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, product of the light.
Fluorescents, the light bulbs with energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new light bulbs to LEDs, this need network-energy twice.
The bulbs fluorescents last on average from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new LEDs bulbs, such as those that initiated the Philips manufacturing this week - the company has also participated in the study of the United Nations - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a light bulb is heating, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These new light bulbs can also work with rhéostats in addition to making very little heat.
And they do not contain mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about light bulbs fluorescents because they contain mercury and we need to eliminate them as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except if the guidelines are in place.
But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the light bulb fluocompacte, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent light bulbs.
Only the United States, these plants produce 25 000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country through this program.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars per year in purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 power stations whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The Ivory Coast is waiting in the nervousness the announcement of election results
"without delay" the Secretary General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the publication of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the expiry of the deadlines.
"the Secretary General stresses the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce the interim results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the United Nations. "
"it calls on all Ivorian parties and institutions to act responsibly and refrain from any action until the announcement of preliminary results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight on Wednesday without publish the results, three days after the vote on Sunday.
About forty minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the chairman of the CIS said on television that the Committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have multiplied Wednesday in the world for the CIS states finally the name of the winner of the run-off between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of fraudulent votes "in the north, held by the ex-rebellion New Forces (National Front) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi Guessan, campaign manager of the Ivorian president, said that the intimidation of voters by the National Front in the north of the country had deterred the supporters of the outgoing president to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints by Gbagbo are adopted by the Constitutional Council.
The opponents of Gbagbo felt that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is headed by Paul Yao N Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
North Alassane Ouattara, a man who denies any link with the former rebels, has deemed "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go so far as to call for the victory.
His allies say that Gbagbo has blocked the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after having prevented the electoral commission to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election on Sunday, was supposed to complete the process of reunification and reconciliation to a country remained split into two for years.
The United Nations warned Wednesday the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished at the top of the first round, on 31 October, 38% to 32% Alassane Ouattara, who has received public support for the former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate has remained stable in France in the 3 th quarter
The unemployment rate in France within the meaning of the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in mainland France (9.7% in the overseas departments), show the provisional data corrected for seasonal variations (CVS) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed to 2.631 million in mainland France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed in 9.3% of the active population in mainland France and 9.7% with the French overseas departments.
A year on, the unemployment rate is rising by 0.1 percentage point.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not available in the two weeks to work and that they are looking for a job or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has deteriorated, with a further increase in the rate of unemployment, increased to 24.2% in mainland France (+ 0.9 point on three months, + 0.5 point on a year) and 25% by including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
Older people have experienced a slight rise in unemployment, to 6.4% in mainland France (+ 0.2 point on three months and a year), 482 000 people from 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the French overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, to 8.3% in mainland France (0.1 point on three months, + 0.1 point on a year) and 8.8% in France.
The Insee silent for monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after an argument on the method of calculation.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexander Guérini indicted and detained
Alexander Guérini, 53 years, business leader of PS treatment of waste and brother of the president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and arrested at the house arrest of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence in an investigation into alleged procurement fraud.
Alexander Guérini has been charged with abuse of public funds, embezzlement and public goods, concealment, active corruption, trading in influence and detention of ammunition, said his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wishes to explain all the questions that the judge will ask him, not fantasies."
"it is easy for a variety of criminal leaders, there is something else to prove," the AFP reported her lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the PS's strongman in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, held, through its lawyers, to put the judge before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, has also been indicted Wednesday evening and arrested.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything other than to operate landfills that he had to manage.
On the allocation of markets or to the destination of the funds linked to their operation, he has never known, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was indicted Wednesday for embezzling public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial control with ban to meet the protagonists of the dossier.
"my client has been able to provide explanations to accordingly."
"the examining magistrate has taken into account in do not deprived of freedom," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.

Source close to the investigation, the investigations focus mainly on the conditions and functioning of a discharge4 The Ciotat, which Aubagne waste as well as of some cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss affair: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of the young French researcher Clotilde Reiss, arrested in Iran for "espionage," held the opinion in suspense in France, diplomacy, and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the watchful eye of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée Palace explained its strategy to Americans, to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not have to return for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian man detained in France and sought by US justice for trafficking of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they place under a harsh light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to promote the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way to deal with cases of hostages."
The Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interact with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals being held in Iran.
"made of noise," they say, "martelez constantly" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
It matters to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"do this all the more that the Iranians ask you not to do so."
Because, past attempts of discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will solve nothing," the Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics."
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "an Iranian tactic familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (who will speak on August 16, when it takes refuge in the embassy of France "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" See- (€230 000).
And he noted that the Élysée Palace anticipate other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "going to get worse."
The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another of some 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison since twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iran's Majid Kakavand, including the US extradition claim for an illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US Embassy, as many observers, is mulling over this troubling coincidence.
For Washington, which is tracking down illegal networks Iran's acquisition of material aimed at the nuclear programme, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France has accepted a bargain?
The release of the Iranian against that of the French?
In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée Palace, he says, not only has "been completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but has sought to oppose it.
"there were loud exchanges between the French Presidency and the Attorney-General" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government may not go back on the judicial decision," drift.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand IYJS remains under the supervision of French intelligence services "close."
The adviser of the Elysée Palace a phone number, clutching, then informed the American diplomat that Iran is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy. "
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée Palace is sparing no effort, by means of releases and "leaks" in the media, to make people believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an important role "" and "impact" of "Ombudsman."
The Americans are watching this activity without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit as several press articles reflected the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "the French official media blitz."
What is at the heart of both expressed "gratitude" to Mr Assad, wondered the Embassy in Paris.
"despite their statements full of praise, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then focuses on the reasons that led the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
The intense effort of communication "aims to validate the Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," that analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, "which was perceived by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and undeservedly."
In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to demonstrate to Syria "what praises it can draw in playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The US Embassy knows of good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"but we thank you."
"this should at least cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss go in France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received at the Elysée Palace.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role for the release of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a so-called "Cinderella" law which will ban for adolescents to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask companies to online games to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16 years, said representatives of ministries of culture and the family.
"a lot of children were playing these games all night and then difficulties at school and to have a normal life during the day."
"we believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the Ministerial responsible in charge of the bill.
The online games will be accessible to 6 hours of the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the time daily access to these games for young people whose parents request, the official added.
It will also be made available to people who are demanding free software which limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and the T4008 newspapers regularly news related to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion of online gaming world competition.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals at the World Cyber movie, about 58 other nations.
2018-2022: the global Fifa from organizers
In turmoil because of suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of the Fifa Thursday refers to the organisers of the 2018 World Cups and 2022 countries, an eminently political choice where the influence and lobbying may take precedence over technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of the competition Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Espagne-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, IFTDO hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or continue its location in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities part of delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Heads of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the extent of the economic and political issues of the World Cup.
The wrangling behind the scenes may last until the last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the evaluation report of the Fifa, English files, hispano-portugais (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not very heavy for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, the origin of the revelations that led to the suspension of corruption from two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have undermined the chances of his country, the cradle of football which has hosted the World Cup only once, in 1966.
The BBC has submitted a layer, Monday, a documentary which points to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What Fifa discontent and the English, officials who have engaged in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron.
The head of the government hopes to repeat the coup succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had obtained in 2005 for London the organization of JO- 2012.
This intense enough to the image of England with the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Espagne-Portugal does not lack of assets with its stages ready, its expertise (Mondial- 82 in Spain, JO- 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its soccer culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of the two countries could doucher their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the British and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal are mounting the rating of Russia, become an outsider despite the shortcomings of his file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to make the trip to Zurich and has denounced a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a veiled reference to the English press accusations against members of the EC.
"the covers of mud, we try to compromise," Mr. Putin launched.
For 2022, the United States, with the experience of 1994, appear to be the logical favourite.
First global economic power, seat of the main sponsors of the Fifa, the country seems to have a head start on Japan and South Korea, who built a wonderful project separately.
But these new applications are premature for two countries co-organised the test in 2002.
Another threat: the granting of Mondial- 2026 to China, eagerly welcomed by the Fifa, which would in fact Asian chances for 2022.
With Qatar, which has lifted the great game by proposing futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the Fifa will continue its expansion into new areas, but these two countries have a greater risk than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the weakness of TV rights acquitted (due to the time difference) by the European countries, the sinews of war for the Fifa.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had led to believe that he hesitated.
Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
A mandate at the Elysée Palace is another.
Therefore, the current head of the state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not sit easily with the mystery attached to the presidential office.
It is as if the doubt is still to be done.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, even without, the friends of Jacques Chirac suggested a third term was not excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured them that he would take his decision "somewhere in the fall of the year 2011."
He mentions in front of UMP parliamentarians, on Tuesday evening at the Elysée Palace, the prospect of "two mandates" has caused a bit of movement.
Was it the official announcement of his candidacy?
It was a long way.
The President was also a reminder that the constitutional revision of 2008 restricted to two the number of time.
It was an observation, not an announcement.
This is not the first time, on the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"at worst, or at best, you have again for seven and a half years with me," was launched in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not think that I am not considering the step after."
He said before yesterday do not make it more candidate than the day before; they do not make it less.
If they are comments, it is for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy for the Socialist Party, on the one hand.
But it is not the substitution of Segolene Royal Nicolas Sarkozy to come forward.
On the contrary, this is because his candidacy in 2012 is clear that many in the PS demand www.etr.org in order of battle earlier than expected.
The bad opinion polls.
For the first time the right-wing voters would prefer the candidature of François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L' Express).
"we have a candidate and there is no discussion to the UMP on this," immediately reacted cautiously and Prime Minister's entourage.
"if it believes the possible defeat, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"it always going to win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned to the obvious.
Euro: forced the ECB to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be the opportunity to clarify the modalities of crisis or, at least, to announce the arrest of a number of unconventional monetary policy achèver operations at the end of the year.
European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt probably cannot afford to be as compelling to worsen a tense situation today on European bond markets.
The political cost would be high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has thus welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of the states in Europe.
She did not want to say whether she thought that the central bank should do more, for example, by increasing its programme to purchase sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...) ."
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown more said about its intentions, preferring instead to indicate that the programme of buying government securities on the secondary market "continues" and that "we will see what we decide" at the meeting on Thursday.
One certainty: the ECB will keep its main interest rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest level since May 2009.
In the facts, the Treasury bond purchases by the ECB last week have doubled, to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, the expectations of a further purchases are no doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a significant change of course.
If the loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the ECB, the latter is still in careprovider unlimited liquidity on generous terms and for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that to be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that it significantly amend its program."
"if not, it would take the risk of tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"a gradual phasing-out announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
On the SENAME plan on the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchasing volume of these obligations to tackle a sluggish market," says Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of the exposure of European banks to the markets of the euro zone sovereign debt, the has no other choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"it needs to replace the lack of investors in the market and act to prevent a runaway yields paid by even the most fragile," has an important bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates are high, the Member will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize.
The protection of the euro is the price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government made the right
After a beginning of the week worrying for Italy, the situation is a little relaxed, yesterday, with the decline in bond rate in 10 years.
A precarious calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the Presidents of region reported having heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation "indecipherable" and expect to a weekend "unpredictable," that was then denied.
Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached the peak of 210 basis points and the price of hedging contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) was increased to 263 points, resulting in a certain panic in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi has noted that in Spain, the gap with the German rate was higher at 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence of the markets" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"the good news is that Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"the bad news is that it is such as Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In clear, his problem is the lack of growth and tax revenues, with the risk of not being able to cover its funding needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... so that the budget under consideration in the Senate on 1.3% and 2% respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission, the public deficit will be 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9 percent forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be put in place after the holidays, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"if necessary, of new austerity measures will be taken," said the Economic Affairs Commissioner, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"the fundamentals of its economy are in order and its accounts are good, we have been saying for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, the Italian director at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy to the IMF.
"there is no problem in the immediate future, on either the short or the long term, because in spite of its larger debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, stitch), the stabilisation efforts in Italy are lower than those required of other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi takes a motion of censure to the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of early elections could be organized at the end of March.
To start a period not conducive to the decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans consider the strengthening of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde stressed in a press conference in Paris yesterday: "The Europeans, I believe that has been demonstrated on Sunday in the day and into the night, solidarity, determined, are clearly committed to defend their currency and monetary zone."
Although relative, the detente yesterday on the rates of European government bonds has contributed to the mill of governments and the ECB.
But we cannot yet talk of a beginning.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's has announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt notes, the most relevant target today by speculation.
"as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, particularly on the banking systems," economists to Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more that "the time is much slower than the time of the markets."
Aware of this and of the dangers, the European countries to intensify the discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis measures.
G20 most directly affected the informal consultations between the Finance Ministers and, more broadly, with their peers.
And also in view of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings of the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro zone in the sights of the markets (see above).
The European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore Asia to inform investors extrême-orientaux developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly is preparing the ground.
The EFSF's first securities are scheduled next month.
Yesterday, an U.S. official told the Reuters news agency that the US would support a possible increase of funds raised by an additional direct engagement of the IMF.
The countries that are in the front line, Portugal and Spain, for their part, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of organisation of the labour market.
Reforms to the austerity measures more attentive.
Lisbon and Madrid want to follow a different path of those of Greece and Ireland.
One and the other at all costs to avoid asking for international assistance in setting up their own budget adjustments and to decide on the structural reforms needed to restore confidence in the long term.
The European cape.uwaterloo.ca, finally, is holding discussions on the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
Mark in Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first proposed the idea that if the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to call in the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the market of the European sovereign debt, consider that an increase of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
The vehicle is: it is the European financial stabilisation NMWR has, to date, EUR 60 billion.
A council which is likely to be considered carefully in the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange vigilance
The episodes neigeux still lead to traffic problems, particularly on the secondary network in Britain, and threaten to disrupt certain economic activities.
Legal-counsel departments are now in Orange vigilance because of the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna, were added to the 20 departments already in Orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to snow Skywatchers France, supported the north of the Gironde and Charentes and it's snowing lightly on the Ile-de-France.
1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm of snow from 2 to 5 cm, time of 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes Armor, Gironde, Dordogne coast, the Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie regions, the Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The neigeux episodes are significant enough to cause difficulties of movement and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Skywatchers France.
In the district Armor Côtes, several have been banned for lorries of 7.5 tonnes, Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The movement on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult, according to the police officers who recommend to take his vehicle in case of need and the movement of some TER coach has been suspended for the day.
The school transport have been banned for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was seen on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights Thursday on the Paris airport Roissy and 10% to Orly because of snow.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers to contact them.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first outlines financial
Since the time that the debate on the modernisation of transport in the Ile-de-France, the billions from the skies.
At least in the discussion.
It is especially 23 billion for the Greater Paris metro that must build the Greater Paris Corporation.
To start this GSP, the state has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical framework, it is this sum to the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of its double loop.
Today, we finally arrived in the early additions.
The Finance Act of 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices designed to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase in the tax on the offices in the Ile-de-France.
The first, but in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is "the benefit of the public institution Society of Greater Paris'.
It was: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a renewal of a tax on the already existing offices "in order to modernise, to increase the product and affect this increase to the Society of Greater Paris'.
It would yield?
Mystery.
This is not figure in the text.
Is a far cry from the $4 billion.
"it is clear that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion of capital will be mobilised by the state and made to the Société du Grand Paris as" project, we read in the explanatory statement.
This system has the GSP, not shocking.
"has it created revenue (the two tasas, night-glasses), we can cover the studies on three years then bang in the $4 billion after, question."
"this will be included in the budget and learned as."
The GSP believes that the $4 billion will begin to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This system, in which the promised 4 billion are still on hold, risk of causing a somewhat turbulent parliamentary discussion.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers vengeful and spies in
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it is an apparent scandal, a scandal that is as scandal in the hypocrisy which governs relations between the Member States, citizens and the press.
On the other, it promises profound changes at the international level, and suggests a future dominated by the regression.
But in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the confirmation of the fact that each record by a secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report on what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi owns), and the eerily typical profile of Gaddafi was for a long time for the cabaret artists to SKIT.
The rule that the secret files must be that new compounds already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go into a bookshop on esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeat (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templiers or Rose-Croix) exactly what was written in the earlier books.
And not only because the author of dark texts do not make new research (or like knows where to look for new on the non-existent), but because those dedicated to occultism only believe that they know already, and that confirm what they had already learned.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
For secret files.
The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited spirit) and the head of the secret services (or it could be, whatever, editor of Libération), which is as true that what he acknowledges.
The top secret information on Berlusconi said that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as Newsweek published the week before.
So why the revelations on these matters have caused a great deal of noise?
On the one hand, they say that any person cultivated already knows, namely the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of states can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic service and, with the exception of a few years of representation, into centres of espionage.
Any spectator of films knows this very well, and it is only through hypocrisy pretending to ignore.
However, the fact of the repeat in public violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is in a bad light American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker would capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
As the scandal is not putting both in crisis victims as the "torturers."
But the very nature of what happened.
Orwell once, at the time, it could produce power as a Big Brother, which controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely proved since, that can monitor each movement through the telephone, the hotel visited each transaction, the motorway and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye of the power.
But when it is shown, as it happens, that even the cryptes secrets of power to the control of a hacker, the report continues to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as avenger of the citizen -, can know all the secrets of power.
How a power which no longer has the option of retaining its own secret take?
Georg Simmel already said, it is true that a secret true is a secret secret (vacuum and vacuum can never be revealed); it is true, too, that know everything about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret vacuum of secrecy, because in the public domain; but, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secret means pull any power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but has done too much to Clinton and Obama.
The consequences of this wound to a very strong power?
It is clear that in the future, governments can no longer put online no reserved - that would be to publish information on a poster hung up on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technology, it is vain hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Well, it's easy to find out if and when a head of state has shifted in aircraft and approached one of his colleagues.
How can be maintained in the future the private reports and reserved?
For the moment, I know that my anticipation notes of science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move in a discreet manner in uncontrollable mail coach travel, carrying messages learned by heart or, at most, in hiding the rare written information in the Achilles a shoe.
The information will be kept in single copy in closed drawers to key: basically the espionage attempt of the Watergate has had less success than WikiLeaks.
I have had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on son (telephone).
The video (analogue) had allowed the researchers in film to explore a film step by step, moving forward and back and see all the secrets of the assembly, but now the CD (digital) do that to jump to chapter by chapter, i.e. by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, andparticipants that LLEX.com www.llrx.com, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communications techniques for cars.
A final observation.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secrecy of the embassies.
Now, are the embassies seeking confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France quick fix its promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine the promises of funding quickly released so-called fast start funding or (early) made by the developed countries.
And the French were tampering.
In the Copenhagen Accord, the developed countries are committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has lifted the great game to persuade its partners to the reality of its commitment to the fast start funding: report detailing the activities of its Member States, press conference, general side event, distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency is valuable and valued: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU reached EUR 2010 2.2 billion, which puts on the right path for the respect of its commitment of $7.2 billion in 2012.
But when one looks at in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is carried out without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference which best suits them.
The European Commission, for example, has seen as the reference year 2009: the international funding, and it adds 150 million over three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of the year or in terms of level of official development assistance.
By contrast, France believes that the funding of "all new projects" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or at the global level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or decline), she claims to respect its commitment of funding "new and additional..."
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses its method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that €1 paid equivalent to €1.
Of course, it is hard to justify: this is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present an euro will recover as equivalent to an euro given... Everything, should be arts-sector under its commitments that the cost of the loan to the lender countries (the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has a line of reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million in 91.5% of loans (389.8 million) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros) - see the document the EU to check for yourself.
It is the only country of the Union to use if the loan on a massive scale.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (other) are meeting their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union is €1 to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents, and considers that the effort is comparable.
A sleight of hand!
In summary, in his fast start funding, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action in the time and the other on the reality of the financial effort.
While spending that EUR 36.1 million, she comes to believe that she spends 420 million "new and additional" consistent with its promises.
The manipulation of the Department of Finance (because, it seems that it is Bercy who has achieved the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why the other Member States would continue to give it enough to pay?) and in the negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early funding is only a small matter, on the short term, in the context of discussions on the climate.
But it could be a grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is essential to learn the lessons of this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in the way of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect of its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could move the discussions on the issues of long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): we will be forced to take the issue of "additionality" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become progressive on these issues it is - on others.
The hope is based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and on his vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence necessary for progress in the discussions.
Warning to pesticides ingested by children
A 10 -year-old interfering in a day 81 different chemicals, according to a study published on Wednesday of the WBWA Générations Future (ex- Movement for Rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value given the low number of samples analyzed, but are to include the issues dealt with," generally purchased between July and September the food consumed in four meals and a snack in one day by a child of a decade, Oise in supermarkets and Paris.
These meals types, including the official recommendations - five fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litre of water a day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The base is damning: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances that are carcinogenic some 37 substances that act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"even if, in almost all cases, the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded in our investigation, we can clearly see that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or EP is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a decade of possible carcinogenic residues and three proved as carcinogenic some as well as almost a dozen residues likely to disrupt the hormonal system.
The potato, imported from Brazil, planned as a snack by the study, this traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
Same thing for green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the minced meat, canned tuna, and even the wand of bread and the chewing gum were full of pesticides and other chemicals.
In the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For the dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the consideration of the plastic base used to warm the micro-onde was not free meals.
The final risk for the consumer to this "cocktails of contaminants" "is probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Greens (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "faced with the urgency of the situation" for a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the presence of 365 different pesticides identified residues in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
