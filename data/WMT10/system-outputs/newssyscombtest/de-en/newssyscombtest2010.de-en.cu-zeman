Schneemangel on the mountains agonizes the hotelbesitzer
Scneelose pisten, sorgenn, not only the riesengebirgen - residents.
The lack of snow leads the people of made the skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions.
So, one can still free in riesengebirge room for all wintertermine incl. christmas and silvester receive.
Our sides are often visited.
The people, the offers by the prices note, binding, but they have now fear, to be.
And if they call, us ask whether our opinion immediately after this year 's weihnachtsfest on snow or "on matsch", will be led the operators of the informationsportals spindl. text, martin jandura, an.
Who the silvester - wants to stay in the spindelmühle just after his ideas, should be no more with the clouded hesitation.
Who favors the saving and in the quality of the second stay only an, will come, the can try to wait even a few days.
The spindelmühle - offer hotelbesitzer now for the silvestertag largely only wochenaufenthalte an.
I think that they will be for a time to come effort to sell them, but they, too, and will have to take on shorter times.
And then will the free room quickly are vanishing, estimated jandura.
Free beds in all winterterminen offers always always the reisebüro ingtours in vrchlabi an.
Now interested us in the most the weihnachtswoche, now is not yet sell.
In our supply, about half of the places is still free.
So we have already some preisgünstigere weihnachtsaufenthalte prepared for the last moment, the director of the travel agencies, ingtours, petr schiefert, an.
The silvestertag in riesengebirge can the vrchlabi - reisebüro still offer, but here, too, there is less free places.
Good paragraph find the first fourteen days in february, the rest of the wintertermine are sold average.
In this year, the interest of the winteraufenthalte is negative beeinflußt that, in riesengebirge is always no snow.
The wait people, whether snow falls.
No one wants to spend the year in the mountains without snow.
Should be the pisten within a week verschneit, will also be the christmas sell, says schiefert.
Conversely, and a bit better than in last year it succeeds, the room in hotel horizon in pecpod snezkou to fill.
We are by about 5% last year, better than.
At the silvestertag and christmas, we have only a few free room.
Great interest, there is in the polish vacations in janua, and in february, the business dues, as well - informed of the director of the best pec - hotels, karel rada.
To 80% for the silvesteraufenthalte is also the hotel omnia in the zentralparkplatz in janske lazne occupied.
By contrast, is to be christmas in the recent hotel in janske lazne nor the half of the beds free.
Pleasant surprised in this year of january, for the us to time, we are already occupied to roughly 60%.
A bit weaker is now the february, but in the moment, even if snow is determined, increases in riesengebirge, this interest in the aufenthalten, the director of the hotels omnia, erik sporysch, an.
Wait for a greater schneebescherung the riesengebirge - hotelbesitzer now.
The donnerstag it should cool and if there is rain, should be the snow in the mountains.
But then should come back a warming, informed jiri jakubsky from the site of the czech wetteramtes in hradec kralove.
Us: repeat is mother of wisdom
It is almost comical, with what schülerstrebsamkeit barack obama, the president, with its reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor, in afghanistan - question, he even for the dümmsten, repeatedly.
After all, when he his longingly expected afghanistan 's doctrine ausschwitzte, it is that he showed this about iraq' s kopierpapier from the bush - - abschrieb szenariovor three years.
Not only that he in the text even several the saying goes, "so, he has even used as in iraq," the name of the bush - declaration in the january 2007 as: "the name of its own declaration of new vorwärtsweg" used, without dithering.
In the process, he even three years ago, the bush - idea - fresh truppenkontingente in the troubled by the civil war sending iraq - - than "irresponsible and in their implications karastrophische" criticized decision.
Subsequent months but showed that the bush - of recommendations for military strategy was the only possible and attracting very successfully, that man in the news about iraq today does not speak more.
Bush 's reputation was not gebessert, because objectively his successor, he has a much dankbarere starting point hintergelassen, as it was to expect.
In afghanistan, barack obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly.
To surge of troop asked him again the military, especially the oberkommandeur of afghanistan 's operation general stanley, the mccristal even, despite the subordinationsgewohnheiten protect zaudernden hart criticized in the white house.
He called for 40,000 soldiers, the situation can, for the better to reverse.
But the president hesitate three months, is on a better idea come and so, he has the general wenistens about 10,000 soldiers cheated.
From europe, he has the promise for another 5,000 - gepresst, even if he was initially at least with 10,000 expected.
Highly problematic an around the obama strategy is its plan to withdraw its troops from afghanistan already in 18 months, and within this process of three years. the whole obama doctrine leave more questions as answers.
Some in doubt that the surge halved will bring the same effect such as the course of action in iraq.
Despite the bruderkrieg of the past few years, too, is the iraq relatively well - society structured, their leaders honor the values.
The afghan situation is shaped by the kontraindikation - rely on no one can be kept and there is no arrangements.
Under these conditions, it is hard to prepare the afghan security forces, which are accustomed to change their opinion, every day.
The political institutions, even if they were founded formally correctly, remain only scheinbauten, behind the patriarchal stammbeziehungen continue to be wuchern.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusual complicated, particularly because of the unübersichtlichkeit iran 's circumstances, the pakistan - and - complicate influences further.
Also build the of a "action" leaders, which is minimalist goal of the entire operation, is very unrealistic.
The obama alienated - strategy by its voluntarism time horizon
Over the last eight years, the situation in afghanistan only from deteriorating further and is now they are on the verge of the explosion.
Believe that the small soldiers to die in the kriegsgeschrei on the "frühheimkehr out", here are can create a miracle, only a truly romantic 's soul, the can impressed by facts do not.
From the political perspective, the datumssetzung is for the withdrawal pure irresponsibility, because the taliban to be seen as the indirect borrow confession of america 's defeat.
The last nato summit, showed that the willingness of europeans, to participate in the combat in afghanistan, tend to.
Europe 's politicians, and want their voters also cannot explain, on which way the security of germany, or italy associated with the war in the hindu kush - gebirgsvorland.
Another possible factor, the situation is radical can affect, the development of the events in iran.
The situation should continue to worsen not work, and the increased sanctions on the iranians, for the united states, is a very hard question is whether to solve the problem is not with troops.
This question must be answered in the period, america 's post - obama to siegerabzug from afghanistan in the continues.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic shift of the afghan situation.
The only trostpflaster for barack obama is the fact that three years to come to the presidential election, and thus remains enough time to remain so that he can pick up to a different strategy, fallls would prove totalausfall them.
The managers of the bank goldman sachs no longer a prämienboni in bar
The top leaders the american bank goldman sachs in this year is no longer a prämienboni in cash.
This has announced the company that responds to the type of strident criticism of their lohnpraktiken.
A group of 30 spitzenmanagern stocks is instead of the money, the man must sell but only in five years.
Moreover, can be stripped of the shares the managers in the case, if they act overly risky.
Goldman sachs is so under the agency reuters at the forefront of the effort, the prämieboni of wall street to associate with long - term performance.
I believe that the wall street, about the deeper direction know is, in which it has to go, the former banker of society, jpmorgan, douglas elliott, an.
The problem lies in the details, ergänzte he.
Goldman sachs, the target of criticism, after it for the first three quarters of this year almost $17 billion for prämienboni aside planted had.
The totaling of prämienboni in the earlier this jahra will after the agency reuters also likely despite of today 's angezeigten measure exceed $20 billion.
The high prämienboni in the banking sector are with the start of the financial crisis in a series of länders has become the heißeste political issue.
Britain reported on mittwoch, that it intends to exceed the bonuses the bankers, the 25,000 pound, unique with a tax burden of 50% to.
Similar steps, france as well.
In this year, the, women have earned nobel won in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five rekordfrauen in stockholm from the hands of deskönigs of sweden today have carl xvi this year. gustaf the nobel prizes in the fachkategorien and for literature.
In addition to the four wissenschaftlerinnen under also has been the german schriftstellerin romanian abkunft, herta died, including.

The last laureatin, the nobel prize in economics, the american elinor ostrom and their compatriot oliver williamson for analysis of wirtschaftsberichtes have.
The only fachkategorie, in the nobel prize in this year, not a woman a received, was physics.
These price today have the scientists charles kao for the research in the fiber optics -, and george smith, combined with willard boyl for the ccd - chip - invention of, the is the basis of all digitalkammeras, faxgeräte or astronomical fernrohre.
Each of these winners, the diplom, the nobelmedaile and bescheinigung about the acquisition of the geldpreises preserved.
The is in each category swedish kronen 10 million.
If there is in each category several winners, will the geldpreis under they divided.
Traditionsgemäß, the american president, barak obama, the most expected friedennobelpreis already afternoon in oslo.
He has in his speech the kontrovere his appointment recognized, because he is only at the beginning of his way, and beyond stands at the forefront of the country leads, the two wars - in iraq and afghanistan.
In maintaining its policies ergänzte he but that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggling of the world, even if the price of this is high.
Minister janota considering the 's resignation. klaus has invited him in the burg
President vaclav klaus conceive am friday early finance minister, eduard janota, the about his remain in the government, because he with the execution of the budgets for the next year in the form, as this by the abgeordnetenversammlung was the most floated mittwoch, is not agree.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the continued of janota cabinet members will be the issues of the freitagstreffens.
The budget will also criticized by klaus.
According to him is the etatdefizit too high to deepening, was also the crisis of the public finances.
Over the conjunction of informed of the präsidentensprecher, radim ochvat.
Over be another remain in its function will janota on monday, jan fischer, negotiate with the prime minister.

In the parliament, but in the mittwoch voted on the left party - proposals to geldumwälzung and the money for the staatsbeamtengehälter, for the bearing the social services and direktlöhne boosted the farmers.
The government has the proposals of social democracy entgegengehalten, that they raise implicit the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand, and the government, klaus and rechtspartei, on the other hand, makes it created a scathing domestic dispute, of the question of further work of the fischer 's - beamtenkabinetts support, on whose shaping the ods, cssd and green party have agreed in the spring.
Critics allege that the budget, so, as it was taken by the parliament, the new stimulus package of austerity moves practically liquidated, in the fall of were enforced by the fischer 's government, and to bring an end to the after their understanding the public debt.
Klaus, who can subscribe to the law on the state, but not must, at the diskussionsfrühstück with today 's entrepreneurs, declared that the leaders of the "serious problem," the "is the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances, neglected have long time.
His view, there are no longer a good solution today.
Improving only a strong government could bring, this still on a broad consensus could build the political parties.
The ods - chairman, mirek topolanek, led to, that the budget is terrifying, and the government should weigh their further existence.
The ods - stellvorsitzende, petr necas, the ctk, said that the concept of beamtenkabinetts with the support of the cssd ods and grünenpartei obvious no longer works.
Premier described fischer in the redaktion similar words as "strong aussprüche."
The cssd - leader, jiri paroubek, responded to the topolanek - words, that the etatdefizit terrifying of topolanek is that the previous administration had prepared for this year, and the $200 billion kronen crosses.
The very mittwoch bewertete cssd the approval of the budgets for the next year as a success.
The volkspartei also was satisfied.

The constant campaigner against the racist apartheid - governance in the south african republic, as well as their first black president, nelson mandela, in his life, american oscar - actors, morgan freeman,.
Freeman, said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen mandela, whether he him in the eastwood - film may be.
A more significant role over matt damon.
I said: "if i 'm they will play him, i must make them.
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for its role in the eastwood - drama of the boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, is already, the leaders of the movement for the elimination of slavery, from the sklavenhalter for the conclusion is that a fiktiven us - president, and also god in "as evan all - powerful," but rarely someone who still live and is so important for many people like mandela.
The former südafrikanischestaatsmann was, for its active activity in the end of the apartheid in the southern african republic 27 years in prison.
He was in 1990 to free can take place undfür four years, he was president of the country.
In 1993, he was nobel peace prize.
"invictus" is the latin word for "ungeschlagen", and at the same time, the name of a gedichtes of english is author william ernest henley, has been 1875 published in the years.
The need to speak was, as he
The film, recounts a true story, in nelson mandela, its forces with the captain of the south african rugbyteams, francois pienaar, zusammenschloss, to the country to be some. the new president mandela, knows that people also after apartheid, is still rassenmäßig, as well remains economically divided.
He believes that he can be people by the sport some, this is why he decides, the rugbyspieler, the world 's, to some belong to the outsiders.
After all, the south african team rises to in the weltcup in 1995.
Freeman worked several years to the mandela - history on the kinoleinwand to bring.
He had no other goal, as this role to play, to the reality of closer to these so closely as possible, said freeman.
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he has.
The actors said, if he and of the world would be in the same land, he would try to meet with mandela, dinner with him to eat and before his speech to be behind the scenes.
The most important war for him mandela, the hand of protection.
I have found, by i them the hand of schüttele, i their energy, it will transfer, and i had the feeling that i know, what they feel, he said.
For me, it is important, to be a become another person.
Matt damon, in the film françois pienaar, captain of the national rugbyteams, in the white players überwogen have.
The actors, said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugbywelt.

Lichtgeheimnis about norway dissolved: the russians have a missile test
With norway was a special lichteffekt unknown origins to observe.
The russian defense has only yesterday acknowledged that near the norwegian border a interkontinentale ballistic missile was tested.
But the start was not successfully and the as a type "again bulava" called rocket, originally of should be proud of the russian army, will slow to the nightmare of russian generals, as well as the premiers, vladimir putin, will.
Its repeated local presence in the raketetest, too, had no positive effect on the success of the probeflüge.
Bulava is mostly don 't have been launched damaged or in the air.
In the russian newspapers, writes man is already over "bulava" than about a "missile, not flies."
A missile, not flies, but would be obvious
This already 13. attempt, has been at the beginning of normal.
Only the conclusion of the fluges, in turn, technical damage to the missile.
Probably exploded the motor in the third raketenstufe.
This "launched bulava" from the nuclear submarine dmitry donskij, drove the under the water of white sea.
These raketentyp gives the launch of the submarine.
So it is likely that the caused by an indeterminate fliegendes object mysterious light about nordwegen, indeed, was damaged "bulava."
Moreover, the norweger since the first moment not doubted that there is a russian - based missile.
By contrast, the generals, diesesmal has kept and claimed that it can do not speak clearly a failure.
The first two stages of the missile fell not, and the accident was only the third stage affected.
In the last cases were the same the engines in the first stage damaged.
Even if no teststart without mistakes, keeps the leadership of the defense came only six of thirteen for success.
The fast fünfzigprozentige success so met with the generals optimism and so will continue to claims that the "bulava" will fly even without problems, and even to ten hyperschall - nuclear warheads with a gesamtgewicht from max. 1,15 tons of will bear.
The proverbial fetisov has signed with 51 years, a jahresvertrag with the cska moscow
The proverbial abwehrspieler vjaceslav fetisov, in turn a professional - eishockeyspiel with 51 years ago.
The former head of the world, olympiasieger and stanley cup - holders helps his team cska moscow in the not from, and is probably in freitagsduel khl against petersburg.
Fetisov, of his career with forty years, in 1998, has concluded, is at the time president of the cska.
After denis kuljas violated, we urgently need a further abwehrspieler.
Fetisov, coached regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We need only some ap the rest of the formalities to clarify cited the agency coach of the moskauclubs of sergei nemcinov.
Now it is not clear whether the comeback will affect the famous eishockeyspielers only a game.
I believe that fetisov is one of these, can raise the moral other players, led players nemcinov.
If fetisov back on the eisfläche comes, he is after ap the oldest of russian professional eishockeyspiel.
In the nhl, the legendary stürmer gordie howe with a whole season played for hartford einundfünfzig years, and could 15 treffer and 26 assistenzen zuguteschreiben.
The oldest of the famous five, fetisov, kasatonov - makarov, larionov, krutov, is a the best and most successful eishockeyspieler in the history.
In the soviet union 's dress, he has two olympic gold medals won seven weltmeistertitel, and he has also in canada cup, as well as in the junior - world cup is triumphant.
In other part of his career he accumulated also successes in the nhl, where he in detroit - dress twice the stanley cup about the head of lifted.
It is member of the eishockey - sternzimmers since 2001.
Hyundai, after the trade unions. all overtime be lifted
The management of the nosovice - automobilfabrik hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
For often angeordneter overtime has heralded the union on monday the streikbereitschaft.
This confirmed the speaker of the automobilfabrik hyundai, petr vanek.
The management will, but with the trade unionists still agree on a samstagsschicht in this week.
We must not give up our fertigungsplan the is a principle, so was on saturday, the december 19th, proposed, voluntary overtime of the reason that two arbeitsschichten would be worked, said vanek.
A web site, sedmicka. cz, wrote that the firm the employee, which the samstagsschicht would work, has offered a bonus of 400 czk.

With regard to it, that the most urgent overtime and brennendste point about demands and complaints were the trade unionists, the vorige week the production, has had hired yesterday 's management afternoon with immediate impact on the lifting of all overtime for the month december decided, led vaněk.
The employees of the automobilfabrik were have been forced to last week, virtually every day after the achtstundenschicht still 2 overtime work.
On the signing of the agreement will reverse the streiksbereitschaft on the part of the trade unions.
Weitereverhandlungen between the management of automobilfabrik and the trade unionists should on the friday afternoon materialize.

They also protested against the poor zahlungsbedingungen and alleged harassment.
By contrast, the management, that the staff must make the overtime adherence to the automobile - lieferbedarfs.
The trade unionists, in ihremmontags - streikbereitschaftsausrufung also demanded that the staff of the last mittwoch the production, be established by had, with no sanctions.
In the area of overtime call for the trade unions, the überstundenarbeit to cut to a minimum.
Moreover, for they pay the payment of 5,000 kronen in this year.
The nosovice - automobilfabrik hyundai employed people now 2000.

Up to these september were here about 80,000 vehicles, today 's fertigungskapazität is manufactured 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance, even in the revolution gestählten revolution hiv - viruses works
The team of czech and german scientists testing new connections, the spread of hiv - viruses in organism prohibiting should.
The main advantage of improved substance, that he is also among the viruses works, who are already resistant to drugs.
This fact, against the downside, that the connection to standard virus - variant,, is not so much as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease aids can still not be cured.
The patients and prolong the medikamentenzusammenstellung but life can prevent the reproduction of hiv - viruses in the body.
But the drug will accompanied by a series of side effects.
Incomplete repression of the virus - reproduction has also be the development of the result sg. resistentviren, against the no drugs are more effective.
The work of the experts of three institutions of the academy of sciences cr, of the vscht (chemically - technological seminary), as well as by the university in prague heidelberg opens the way, as one can deal with the virus - resistance.
They have shown that the than metalokarborane called on the eiweißstoff work, the is responsible for proliferation of hiv - viruses.
The metalokarborane are ties of bor, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus - reproduction than all today used drugs in other ways, so they can overcome the resistance - problem.
In their work to reach the scientists bitterly bitterly new improved links, the on the basis of knowledge of molekularmechanismus of their ties of the viruses - eiweißstoff were being prepared.
The metalokarborane have a unique three structure: two vielfächige käfige, die from bor -, hydrogen - and - carbon - - atomen persisted, and by a metall - nuclear, cobalt, coupled are in this case.
Heimtückisches and consistent virus
Hiv - protease is eiweißstoff of the anti - hiv virus, for the life of the virus is vital.
Without the caused by the hiv - protease hiv virus - split would no infektionsvirenpartikel tire emerge.
If we are hiv - protease eliminated, we are switching also the reproduction of the virus in the body of the patients from, explain the scientists in the pressebericht, of the institute for organic chemistry, and biochemistry of the academy of sciences cr was published.
In the work that in the wissenschaftszeitung journal of medicinal chemistry was published, describe the scientists whole ranks of ties, in which two couples of the käfige (see table) by a brief organic indexed chain are, the then systematically will continue to changed.
But something weaker, more reliable
The effect of this series of exposure against hiv - protease wurdne in reagenzglas tested, but also against their steadily (resistant) variant, who were won by hiv - infected patients.
The effect of the metalokarborane in the normal enzyme - variant, is not so much as in the clinically leveraged drugs, but they do not will lose their effect on the resistentvarianten, against which the leveraged drugs are often ineffective.
The unique wirkungsmechanismus, as well as their continued features, such as the biological, and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of further chemical gestaltungen, power metalokarboranen interesting links for further to the development of effective drugs used against hiv research, says pavlina rezacova, head of the laboratories for strukturbiologie of the institute for organic chemistry, and biochemistry and the institutes of molecular genetics of the academy of sciences.
Dispute for budget. ods went on fischer los, the fights back
The chairman of the ods, approved mirek topolanek, has called the budget for the next year, as a "terrifying", and the government of prime minister by jan fischer should be his opinion after their further existence superior.
The release of the ods dubbed the prime minister as a "strong aussprüche."
It can be supposedly time for the analysis.
The deputy ods - chairman, petr necas, has said that the concept of beamtenkabinetts with the support of the cssd ods and grünenpartei obvious no longer works.
After necas, the prime minister needs to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority, in the parliament, if it is in the fight against the rising deficit, be, or whether it him to remain in office with the help of parlamentlinken.
The herangehen the ods and the social democrats of the problem of the public deficits is diametrically dissent, has necas pointed out.
The parliament has assumed at the mittwoch the budget for 2010, but with linkpartei - objections for more than $12 billion kronen.
The parliament has the money for staatsbeamtengehälter, for the bearing of social services, and for direct an increasing the farmers.
The government has the proposals of social democracy entgegengehalten, that they raise implicit the budget deficit.
Czech republic, with a backlog of 163 billion should kronen economies.
The ods has before the vote leave the saal, so it is the government 's desire to, because the revised also budget is only a less bad version of the budgetprovisoriums. frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, eduard janota,, has spoken on his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas premier jan fischer has led to the new situation that the government still viewed.
Necas is convinced that, if janota seriously with his resignation in the case would have threatened, that the introduce thought would, the situation would look different.
According to the czech tv has janota for monday after the regierungsgeschäft prime minister registered.
In the process, he indicated that he be another reviewing remain in office.
Is reason to his disappointment about the verhandugn of the budget.
How much fischer for the further struggle with the budget deficit, thus, under necas the nominanten of social democracy (cssd), the changes in the budget enforced had nothing to do, in the government.
The premier should also clear, say that he resign, when the parliament will continue to deficit - boosting believed, for example, the laws, affecting the krankengeld and pensions, or the dienstgesetzesnovelle.
Topolanek: by the ods - nominated minister wrong, not
It is a matter of the premiers fischer and around the government.
The by the ods - nominated minister have not made mistakes, has highlighted topolanek in a textmeldung out of the us.
It has mentioned, that in some ministries in deputy function people, to the top 09 profess, against the country 's budget correct.
Necas stressed that, if fischer darür decides, on the fight against the deficit - size of the public finances to sacrifice, "it is entirely logically and correctly, that he relies on the linksmehrheit, which is now in parliament."
Then he supposedly with the support and tolerance of civic democratic cannot expect.
I have about not thought, and if the current, then, i am me to employ, will be said of the civic democratic named defense martin bartak the journalists in parliament.
Premier fischer, afternoon on the meeting of the european council to brussels.
The ods came back on desire of the premiers
Necas emphasized at the same time, that the ods likely in the mittwoch in the parliament would vote against the changed budget, if the premier the members of the civic democratic explicitly ask, that they would enable the adoption of the budgets.
We are not as such orphans before, we are not small children, so he responded then to the question of whether the ods in the political negotiation of the budget by absence of the party in parliament, as well as in the czech republic, was not back.
I am not gemerkt that my vote lack would.
Even when i at renounced the mandate, i knew that it in coming months before all bolschewisierung of the parliament, and destruction all positive would fail, responded topolanek itself.

Vaccine against pneumokokken free and voluntarily
Imfung against pneumokokken changing january the practice.
It is to be as a first for the families be free and voluntarily.
But now report votes, that the duty - vaccine would be effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free vaccine against pneumokokken kulminieren.
The arzneiinstitut is already the maximum prices the vaccines firmly, the need to pay for the health insurance programs.
The experts are also aware of the impfungsverfahren.
New vaccine
Vaccines for free august - children
On january can be vaccinated children freely against pneumokokken, the on august 2. last year, and later were born.
The condition of st, that they have received no impfdosis.
Who with the vaccine has in last year, or started earlier, must also weiterewiederholungsimpfung even pay.
The first impfdosis between the 3. and must be given to 5. month of life of the child.
Already voriges year, a quarter of families their children against pneumokokken shot.
The parents paid 1600 kronen and more for a dose of.
For the vaccine of the recent children four cans are needed.
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the impfdosen 300,000 to 450,000 spend kronen per year.
They save but in the treatment, the children would need without vaccine.
Until now, the state for all the flächenimpfungen children spent about 500,000 per year.
The duty - vaccination, with the sogenanntem janota introduced - package.
Pneumokokken cause mittelohrentzündung, but also severe infection, including gehirnhautentzündungen and blutvergiftung.
By pneumokokkeninfektionen die in our after studying in hospitals per year - old - age to 28 children to 10 years.
Outside czech, was the duty - vaccine of children against pneumokokken introduced in accounts for roughly 40 countries.
Vaccination will be duty?
At the same time, is said that the vaccine future duty may be.
On january is this be paid by the insurance and voluntarily.
That the duty - vaccine would be better, naming for instance, the leader of the bürgervereinigung nahlas, rudolf kalovsky.
Its unification, even in the long - term for the pneumokokken - vaccine.
The experts on the international conference, was involved in our union, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccine.
This is not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that it is us managed, at least the reform.
I believe that this is the way that we now have to go, led kalovsky an.
The health will not change but the impfverfahren against pneumokokken.
In this moment contemplating we don 't be said, speaker vlastimil sesen.
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the fachgesellschaft practical kinderärzten, hana cabrnochova, too, that has a voluntary vaccination their use.
If all children would be vaccinated, then you might think about the reduction of wiederholungsimpfungszahl, "in a situation in which the vaccine so is expensive, we understand the political decision, that these vaccine as a voluntary was launched," says allerdingst cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80% of the parents their säuglinge against pneumokokken next year, shot.
The vaccine against pneumokokken is also is profound, that these as a first flächenimpfung paid by the health insurance programs, and will not by the state.
The insurance should save the money to spend on the prevention, so that they for further treatment, erkärt cabrnochova.
The doctors, vaccines must even more.
Thus, however, is a concern the practical kinderärzte, the einkauf the vaccines concerns.
After the original plan should be the vaccines by the insurance eingekauft and receive the doctors this then in the same way, as well as other issued by the state to they vaccines.
But some members feared that the insurance could so "the money out of krankenversicherungherausführen."
So the doctors vaccines will be even more, and must wait until the insurance pay them.
After the estimates, the individual practical doctors per month 40,000 need to invest kronen, which is a significant amount.
This will not be easy, says cabrnochova.
They still and we
The islam can be french?
Pluralism, and pragmatism in a secular state.
In a time, voters in the swiss for a bauverbot have voted for minarette and the concern about the alleged islamization of europe is widespread, john bowen, an american professionals, a sound and deliberate report written about whether muslims in one of the pronounced säkularisiertesten societies can be integrated — and be integrated europe.
Some readers will this new book of admiration for the last work of the author: "why the french no headscarves worn love" (originaltitel: "why the french don ’ t like headscarves") read (in 2006), to a study elegant and dense argumentierenden an issue, which the land divided over half decades and workers and their effects are still to perceive as well.
Bowens neustes book offers a more inclusive, and kühneres spectrum.
As a good anthropologist it wants to know, was not only the politicians and the media say about the islam in france, but what is happening in the area truly.
He has spent months in mosques, schools, and institutions, now the 5% - 6 million muslims in france, as it bowen calls "islamic liberty" provide.
He is a good audience, he is debates between teachers, and students on the questions that they worry most again.
Should a muslim in a mosque, or a city hall marry (or both)?
Should be young muslims over evolution and gay rights of lectures?
Can a muslim woman a non - muslim man marry?
For a muslim, it is permissible, to use a zinsorientiertes banking system, to get a mortgage?
It is this seemingly mundane affairs, he claims, the daily life 's population, in contrast to the political dramas, which the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imamen, teachers, and intellectuals, none of them with a well - known names, possibly with the exception of tarik ramadan, a in switzerland born in the arab - muslim scholars and academics.
This new generation tried to open, the debate about, how it is possible, one hand, a good muslim, and, on the other to be a good citizens in a modern secular society.
They have not all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are wary of the idea of a french or europe 's islam.
The thinkers and activists, the bowen respondent, with their salafi - gegenstücken often at odds – cheerleaders of the puristischen sunni islam, with the saudi - arabia in connection is – today 's show a small, but influential presence among europe' s muslims.
Bowen is the view that might be compatible muslim values and french secularism.
But an agreement requires a, and take on both sides.
He is, how much french policymakers (and into the intellectual elite, the so passionate the separation of church and state guard) really pluralism committed.
He suggests that muslims may experience a rauere treatment as catholics protestants and jews, which in turn their historic compromise had to do with the secular republicanism.
He sees a "worsen the werteschrauben" rather than a growing pragmatism.
The islam can be french? after the read this book, one is tempted to say, "yes, but not yet."
The trostloseste outlook of the world
The arctic is changing and dramatic faster than any other umweltregion on earth.
That they marks, the ice melts with alarming speed, and live with the nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, schifffahrts - and fischereiinteressen have in the newly open water begeben, with diplomats, lawyers, and now also authors in their wake.
Richard ellis, a author and illustrator paints, "in" on dünnem ice (originaltitel: "on thin ice") a life of the icon of the north, the polar bears.
Bewandert in the complicated history and politics of walfangs, he described the long tradition of arktiserforscher, the have proved themselves with the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral nelsons encounter with a bears as a brave 14 - year - old fähnrich to see, the only with the gewehrkolben his muskete fought, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bear, the caught, as they were behind the bodies were killed their recently mothers schwammen, were brought in zoos, and zirkusse.
A zirkusaufführung the beginning of the twentieth century showed 75 polar bears in an idea.
Even today have zooanlagen still living typically a millionstel of lebensbereichs of a wild alttiers. the climate is rarely suited: the eisbär in singapore was not green of the seaweed, in the lofty hair his pelzes grow.
For the visit, they here, more to learn!
Ellis refers to the reports of other writers and historian and is often back to the threat, the hunting for the survival of the species.
Although in norway, america and russia 's outlawed,, the judgment in greenland and canada continues, where hunting in helikoptern and motorschlitten - fahrende inuit powerful sturmgewehre use to bring their prey to the wayside.
Ironically, in the waters of these two jagdnationen ice in the north 's longest - remain.
In his new book after the ice, "" (originaltitel "after the ice") offers alun anderson, a former editor of the wissenschaftsmagazins "new scientist", a clear and disturbing description of the science of arctic and a packenden glimpse, like the future could develop.
For example, not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphärenwissenschaftler nor ozeanografen can explain the speed of changes appropriate.
But this is not a lack of erklärungsversuchen.
The pionierreisen of fridtjof nansen at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, verwirbelung of the packeises gauged for the first time.
The verschiebenden submarines vermaßen in the cold war grate in unterfahren.
A useful complement are satellitenvermessungen, and the widespread ausbringung of messsonden on eisbergen, but still is much by bold people, the out in the cold kampieren, achieved.
Anderson casts a look in the curious, tiny world, the zuflusssystems within the arctic ice, the formed by salzwasserrinnsale will, at the gefrieren zusammengedrückt.
But, ranging from the bear on the ice to the microscopic surprised in ice, all of them are threatened, once the sommereis vergeht, thus in the period between 2013 and 2050.

When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration have a constructive effect on the international considerations, he replied in english: "this is something that i am not aware of it was."
He, then proceed in mandarin and said: "because the veranstaltungsort is large, can 't i hear, what is happening out."
, he found that it from the perspective of the individual abhänge, or whether the demonstration damage would help.
It shows the concentration of broad public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.

Prüfungsdaten show stubborn rassenkluft
The credentials last week to mathematikleistung were welcome good news for the public schools in washington, d. c.
Although the district washington is still far behind the country 's schools, produce the highlighted, the credentials, show that the viert - and achtklässler progress faster than cities in the past two years, the atlanta, include chicago and new york, have done.
But what in the recent figures, the national assessment of the bildungsfortschritts (national assessment of educational progress - - including naep) is, is the stubborn leistungskluft between african - american, and white students, both at the local, as well as national level.
The average punktzahl of the white viertklässler from washington, d. c., in the past two years of 262 rose to 270 (on a scale of 500), their african - american peers, but only by three points of 209 rose to 212.
The leistungskluft rose in reality, between 2007 and 2009 of 53 on 58 points.
The progress of african - american achtklässler has remained in the taken virtually the same, he fell to get a statistically vernachlässigbaren point of 245 to 244.
The average punktzahl white student was not included in the monitoring, because the stichprobenumfang was not big enough.
The picture of a sechsjahreszeitraum, is not encouraging.
The gap, the white and black viertklässler divided in 2003, when the first naep in this was gripped district, was to 60 skalenpunkte (262 202).
And, while the punktzahl, the children of both groups have reached, is increase in this period, the difference with little now 58 issues has declined.
Some of the bildungsbefürworter of the distrikts expressing their concern about last week, that the results, the of schulkanzlerin michelle a. rhee and the democratic mayor adrian m. fenty were celebrated, the largest part of white students, the already powerful children are carried out, were.
This suggests that we gesamtwertung by have raised the treatment of those at the top of the scale, what is problematic and difficult, said jeff smith, board of d. c. voice, a nonprofit group, for the bildungsgleichheit in washington, d. c. entry.
I do not springe for a range of two or three points on and down, the democratic washington stadtratsmitglied said, kwame r. brown, the daughter of the eaton - primary schools has in the fourth class.
Brown, a frequent critics of the managementstils of rhee, said that the message of the prüfungspunktzahlen is that the city 's mittelschulen need urgent attention.
Of course, wants to see the positive signs is always man, the i respect.
But what me ängstigt, is that we do not nearly the time and energy, we need to use for our mittelschule.
Rhee said, the district must continue to find better ways to live up to the needs of the leistungsschwachen students.
In this autumn some teachers is occur, for example, will be a new leselehrplan, to use the wilson - - read system, which is based on students in the upper classes of primary school and mittelschule aimed at which grundfähigkeiten of the reading have mastered not at the beginning of their schullaufbahn, and the significantly behind their peers klassenkameraden behind.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, the from kindergarten until the sixth class games, and shifted to lebensechte experience in the forefront, under the former top schulinspektor clifford janey be brought to washington, and this curriculum some of the naep - progress has been last week, the reported, attributed.
I believe that we need to continue to work, the best measures to let the students zugutekommen the under the notenniveau lie, said rhee.
Others say that the naep - results, highlight, the question whether rhee can continue to improve the total of the system, and it continues to the extra money and the resources for the leistungsschwachen can provide schools, the necessary are, in order to shrink the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for michelle rhee, said bruce fuller, professor of education at the university of california at berkeley, the urban prüfungsergebnisse examined.
The conventional remedy is, its resources, and managementreformen on the schools, the, in the poorest areas of washington, d. c..
The purpose of political aftermath could create, the against these important work agenda item.
The point is, of course, like other urban schulinspektoren, that they tried to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we establish a system great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the communities, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure, that their children can preserve a great public schooling.
Janey, who is now schulinspektor in newark, this week in an interview, said that one of the world 's most important elements of closing of the leistungskluft is, the traditional public schuljahr, the in washington are currently 180 days, to prolong, in order to compete with the charter - schools.
One must increase the schuljahr, to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said janey with its teachers, the last year to an agreement on 185 days per year, which he came as "a landmark" on the path to a major increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than zukunftsaussicht
Of the reisebus the gettysburg - college with a be achieved pfeifen.
Graciela rodriguez, 12, rising from and blinzelt supporters of a moment in the white pillars, of ziegelsteinfassaden, and the smaragdgrünen lawn.
Gracielas parents have little of the high in el salvador completed.
Until recently had graciela, the in silver spring geborgen, and now in riverdale lives, was never one foot bet on a college - campus.
Their attitudes and the other achtklässler explore the group, the gettysburg, where the teaching costs 38.690 dollars per year, was that of a ehrfurchtsvollen rather besuchers, than that of the enthusiastic future students.
Here, "yes, i will soon be called!" graciela, wants to study the likes to medicine, as the leader, proclaimed that they had now buildings for science 's grounds.
"wow, she said really?" thoughtful, as their the low professor - to - students - relationship was the school reported.
The college in pennsylvania, it was 7., the children on their three visited tour, and now, they have taken fully, the proposed message: the question is not whether man 's college.
The question is, where.
One, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the us hispanischer immigrants, which not end the high, or a teenager become pregnant, but it is also hundreds of thousands, which the collegeausbildung, which is needed to in the middle class.
In truth, one in five of this "second - generation" of hispanoamerikaner the college, – was a remarkable performance is, because many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from mexico and central america, in the us came to have completed, without the high.
Their success stories are important, researchers, say, because they for a generation, the play a large role in the labor force of the country, the way forward will demonstrate.
Those who study, the powerful children, say, these often have a natural affinity for the school and a them regime drive to success.
Many of them have also parents, the high goals and find ways to their children to compensate for their lack familiarity with american schools.
But beratungsprogramme are also playing a large role, by graciela millions of children and how they help to come to the college, especially, if this effort is about a long time to stay.
If one low - income children, whose parents do not have the experience and skills, to help them in wegsuche by the system, then, at some point a single measure will not solve the problem also, said patricia gándara, forscherin at the university of california in davis, the hispanoamerikanische students studied.
We need to reflect on for these children a unterstützendes network of the vorschule until by the high to provide.
The bundesprogramm, the gracielas college - financed tour had, is a useful precedent.
It is known as gear up - - a gang hochschalten - and, more than $300 million per year for local education available to begin to launch college - vorbereitungsprogramme that, if low - income students in the mittelschule and weiterlaufen, until they have engaged in the high.
According to the us - department for the program, education has helped since 1999, more than 10 million students, more than 60% of which the college are gone.

Us secretary of defense, gates: iran, with additional sanctions expect
Defense robert m. gates friday, said that the world 's powers soon be "major impose" additional sanctions on iran, because he is not an talks about his atompläne has participated.
Gates spoke during a 7 - day trip, by the kriegsgebiete in afghanistan and iraq to a group of roughly 300 us - - soldiers in northern iraq, and has played a military action against the prospect of the islamic republic iran.
In iran are not good opportunities for election, he said in response to the question of soldiers to the probability of such a development.
One of the things, the "on the soul told me, that is, if we in the past six years have learned something from iraq, the war 's own unvorhersagbarkeit."
The obama administration prefers a sanktionspaket, into consideration the aims at iran 's military and political elite, but gates has announced that some sanctions could affect the durchschnittsiraner.
He said that a "stimulus package an positive and negative incentives" is needed to persuade, "to the iranian government, that they with nuclear weapons in reality, less protected," because "their people immensely" will suffer from the sanctions.
The friday has in a statement from the speaker of the white house, robert gibbs, the american government attached to europe 's leaders in the warning that iran with "credible" consequences expect must, if he with its nuclear program is not the demands of the un security council, and its nuclear - überwachungsorganisation, the international atomic energy agency honored.
Iran claims continue, that the knowledge of the nukleartechnik should be won only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in geneva on october 1. the iran, said that he would accept the talks to curb its nuclear program and on a significant part of its lagerbestands an enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuklearbrennstoff for his medical forschungsreaktor would forgo.
The us government has to this kind of agreement, pushed to build trust between the two parties and time for negotiations to win.
Iran, but since then the negotiations seems to have to leave the interim agreements - - on the part of, say experts, because the iranian leadership is about divided, whether they should commit themselves to the united states.
Iran 's suspension of the international community in terms of some proposals, which they are in early october had already agreed, simply, has left behind, frankly, the international community, including the russians, and chinese, in a way, as they did in connection with important together additional sanctions for iran were never said, gates.
President obama has the 31. dez. as a deadline for iran will continue to respond to these proposals, before he other options, including those who secretary of state hillary rodham clinton once called "heavy - handed sanctions, will continue.
In a popular in new york statement has denounced the iranian representation in the united nations, what they in the donnerstag "grundlose and unfundierte claims" some sicherheitsratsmitglieder to the iranian atomaktivitäten called and, said that they are willing to the talks with the united states and other five world powers continue, "to reach a suitable long - term solution."
Gates, should return of the last friday to washington, met on the morning with the iraqi prime minister nouri al - maliki, before he in iraq in the oil - rich kurdish region to meet with the soldiers in kirkuk and kurdish behördenvertretern in irbil.
The tensions between the kurds and the arab majority in iraq are remains high, in particular, in terms of borders, because of property rights and the division of public revenue.
Gates, both sides, pushed to shrink the konfliktpotenzial, to prevent delays of the us - plans, the american troops to shrink by the end of august of 115.000 to 50,000.
Gates also sought, the kurdish concerns about the impending withdrawal to dissipate. us officials cited gates, to the masud barzani, president of the kurdish regional government, said: "we are their security, their wealth and receive their autonomy within a unified iraq.
We will not leave them. "
A course in the older, china
Wang weijia and their husband grew surrounded by propagandaplakaten on, the lectures them, that "mother earth tired is, to other children," and "a baby more a grab means more."
These lessons have learned it so good, that, as government officials in shanghai, the by the low birth rate and the aging population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, directly and the ultimate was their answer: "no case on".
We have already all of our time and energy invested in a child.
For a second kind is left of, wang said nothing more, 31, a personalleiterin with a 8 - month - old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one - child "policy in china, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled einzelkindern, the affectionately be called" small emperor ", has produced a bevölkerungskrise, in the country.
The average fertility rates is to 1.8 children per few in comparison to 6 at the time, as a fallen came into force, these policies, the un -
Department for bevölkerungsfragen firmly, while the number of the group of 60 years, and older in 2020 by 16,7% of the population is to rise to 31,1% exploded by 2050. this is far beyond the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities, with educated population, such as shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 - year - old and older fast 22% of the reported shanghai, while the birth rate of a child 's inhabitants per has been a few.
Xie lingli, head of the shanghai stadtbevölkerungs - and familienplanungskomission has said that couples need to get in zeugungsfähigen old age babies "to help to shrink the ratio of the older bevölkerungsanteile, and to alleviate the labor shortages of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "so old - - but not so rich - - as the developed countries, such as japan, and sweden, his," she said.
A gradual detente
In the country 's constitution enshrined in 1978, china' s one - child policy may well be the most controversial available, the from the ruling communist party until now was introduced.
Couples, the against these policies violated, with huge fines expect - - must to its triple jahresgehalt in some regions - - and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese staatsvertreter have it attributed to this policy that the critical demands of natural landesressourcen could be avoided, whereas menschenrechtsvertreter abuses have doomed in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural regions have some officials pregnant women, the already had a child, being forced to abzutreiben.
Many couples had also geschlechtsselektive conduct abortion, leaving a unnatural high ratio of men to women vacuum.
In the past few years, government officials for population gradually its stance on the one - child policy diminished.
In 2004, more exceptions, they have allowed the rule - - including urban, members of ethnic minorities and cases, in which both husband, as well as wife have been einzelkinder are - - and 2007, the tone of many hard slogans watered down.
Qiao xiaochun, a professor at the institute for bevölkerungsforschung of the beijing university, said that government officials recently even more radical changes have discussed, for example, to allow couples two children, in which a partner is einzelkind.
Shanghai in july was the first chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters, the families belehrten, only to have a child, were almost of policies, replaced overnight into question the describe in detail, who for a second kind, and as one can apply the approval.
The city government has sent urban employees, and voluntary for family planning to couples at home to and informationsblätter under the doors of durchzuschieben.
They also asked, psychological, and financial advice for the to provide, the more than have a child.
The response was not encouraging, said familienplanungsvertreter.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a rural town in the außenbereichen of shanghai, said that a boom in the claims of couples is to see, the after the start of the campaign, want to a second kind, by contrast, the urban districts report no change.
In the community huinan with a population of 115.000, for example, still only four or five claims a per month.
Disappointing shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city, despite the campaign is still at around. 165.000 - - will be slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng juying, head of the familienplanungskomitees of the shanghai community caolu, has said that financial considerations are probably the key reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to their first be the best, she said.
Yang jiawei, 27, and his wife, liu juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to two children have, and this is also legally allowed.
But they have, like many chinese, only a small health and life insurance of government.
Without a social safety net, they say, would be this decision irresponsible.
People in the west assess the one - child policy falsely than human rights, said yang, a bauingenieur, whose woman in the seventh month with its first child is pregnant.
Yes, man raubt us to have the possibility of, more than a child.
But the problem is not simply in a politics.
The problem is the money.
Other couples psychological reasons for their reluctance to.
Wang, the personalleiterin, said that it wants to only a child, because it was also a einzelkind. "we were used to the center of the family, and that everyone has spends all around us.
We are not accustomed to care for others to us, and want this, too, does not really. "
Chen zijian, a 42 - year - old, which a übersetzungsunternehmen, said it blunt heard.
For parents from the middle class, with doppelkarriere, by the birth rate is falling revolves, he said, it is about to be successful and must be selfishly.
The age of today 's 20 - - 39 - year - old grew to do so on, their parents during the early days of china' s kapitalismusexperiments struggle to see, and they want to so none of a life for themselves, he said.
Also, a single child, he said, huge demands an the time of the parents.
A mother must give up their social life for at least two years.
Then there is the raumfrage - - "man, his home umbauen must be" - - and the life - - "if the child is 9 months - old, you must have already a trajectories for the best preschool any."
Most of his friends are ready to this a time, chen said, but not two time.
Our generation is the first, the has achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don 't want to bring too many victims.
Un - group, designs plan to emissions
The nurtured by the un climate change - - the - now by wild postures and mutual accusations auszeichnete - - has in the friday with the publication of a document put back a focus, for the next 40 years of an ambitious cuts recording of greenhouse gases in the near future, with the industrialized countries need to the greatest burden shoulders.
The text, as the basis for a final political agreement to regulation of greenhouse gases could provide, both the remaining obstacles aufgewiesen has shown, as well as the way forward.
But he was seen as a more important progress in a negotiation, the time, as next week more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in copenhagen.
The text, of a specifically created for un - was working formulated, silent about the money supply from the rich countries to the poor countries should be, so that they can address global warming short - and in the long run.
He also offers a range of options for the issues, including as industry - - and large emerging markets can limit their kohlenstoffausstoß and how much of the upper limit the global temperature increases should be, the the policymakers would.
The process is a large flexibility, so john coequyt guiding representatives of the sierra clubs in washington.
Michael zammit cutajar, the sechsseitige document designed, has a long verhandlungstext 180 sides summarized, in order to put the in the center, was the un 's leading klimaschutzvertreter, yvo de boer, as "the great whole, called".
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the advanced industrial countries together their emissions by 25 - 45% by 2020, in comparison with the limits of 1990, lower, while greater developing countries would reduce its emissions would reduce by 15 to 30% in the same period.
Together the countries could cut emissions by 2050 by 50 - 95%.
The european community has the talks on friday also a boost by their assurance given, over the next three years to come provide us $3.6 billion per year to poorer countries to help to adjust to the effects of climate change - from the champions of floods and droughts, until the avoiding deforestation.
The friday, yet the same verbal feuerwerke had, which determines the talks in the last week.
The us has rejected language, klimasonderbeauftragte envoy todd stern began, the binding for the developed countries, compared with voluntary cuts of greenhouse gas emissions reductions for greater emerging markets, demand, if they are not financed by the advanced economies.
This train announced that the obama administration a more robust in line with china drive, when representatives of the bush administration not even two years ago.
The united states will no sign agreement, without that greater emerging markets and urging measures, so stern, which also about sued, that the text doesn 't go far enough to ensure that could be confirmed the cuts also from outside.
Stern, his statement an hour after the declaration of china 's vizeaußenministers he yafei, the implied that it' s leading american klimaunterhändler either an "of reason" mangele, or it "highly irresponsible," he was that he in the early week, said that the united states, china do not financially would help, the global warming.
By that future economic marschrichtung of the great of the world 's powers at stake, have both within the developed world, as well as between abandoning the advanced economies and emerging markets fault lines.
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with china, and the united states because of their corresponding commitments befehden, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need, bolder measures to.
Ricardo ulate, a delegates from costa rica,, said that it is not surprising that the great powers struggle, who should bear the costs for the bremsung of the ghg emissions, because even affected countries moved, aggressive are, the countries with very high treibhausgasabgabe to hold accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game, suggesting a new economic dominance will evolve, so ulate, even as a regional klimawandelberater for conservation is international engaged in mexico and central america.
Some of the countries that are exposed to the the strongest impact of climate change, an that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in copenhagen, although the leading participants in the best case, say that the talks will lead to a political agreement.
The alliance of the small island states with 43 members of has in the early freitagmorgen submitted a 24 - page draft treaty.
Artur runge - metzger runs, the international climate negotiations for the european commission, said that the small island states "offensive exercises political pressure on the entire political process," in part, because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, like china and india, demand.
The talks received a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most open questions before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved in order to come to an agreement.

Britain 's first 225 km / h faster defined the montagsgefühl new train
Montagmorgen to 5 clock 13, a 's tune the penetrate darkness, for a zugabfahrt programs, which is a revolution in traffic in britain.
The first hochgeschwindigkeitspendlerzug in the country will be in its blitzfahrt of ashfort, kent, to london st. pancras 225 km / h destinations and 93 - kilometer in 38 minutes to achieve.
To lord adonis, which transport, will then lady kelly holmes on board of the first javelin - pendlerservices london.
He hopes that the new service britain finally to an international schienennetz faster, more reliable trains will ankoppeln, and the large ballungsgebiete midlands, the north, and scotland 's an london bind will.
The neglected province could be reduced to be living pendlerstädten, would arbeitsanfahrtszeiten radical and the shift from plane and auto to underground would reduce the national carbon emissions and congestion on the streets.
In the theory of the three major parties believe this vision.
But the british pound, many billion, the are necessary for the construction of a new national schienennetzes, the inevitable planungsschlacht and fears about environmental degradation in the british hochgeschwindigkeitsgleisen could still draw the brakes.
High speed two (hs2), a in january gegründetes companies, the government is to lay out a durchführbarkeitsstudie, will lord adonis according to the times the report on december 30, of.
This is he a detailed streckenkarte of the next planned level of the hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetzes.
The new bahnlinie, the london is to combine with the west midlands, will be with a room of five meters an urban areas and in places vorbeiführen are controversial, where the impact on the environment.
In the free site, the plan within a abstands, the concept of 25 meters of to point to the final way.
For a greater hs2 is to three options, nordwärts leading hochgeschwindigkeitsschienennetz index.
Lord adonis will in the spring of respond.
The preferred proposed option is a y - shaped streckenführung, in which a single hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecke would lead in the west midlands.
The wayside would share in or in the near birmingham and a abzweig would west of the pennines after manchester and scotland, and others in the direction of northeast after a sheffield that leeds and at newcastle upon tyne.
A single line would lead to scotland.
"it seems to be the best functioning option," said one railways - insider.
After the completion would the reisezeit between london and reduce edinburgh 40 minutes to 2 hours.
The first teilstrecke, the would not be of 2025 opens up, it would allow the visitors to the wayside london - birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with today 's something about an hour, to go.
The narratives böten the traits the possibility of, with a speed of 400 km / h to drive, which would the british schienennetz europe 's fastest.
The first wayside was planned, so that 400 meter long trains with a maximalkapazität of 1.100 people can drive.
To 18 trains on the wayside london per hour birmingham could be in operation.
This would mean that would be needed in london endstation, on the could be handle 20,000 travelers per hour.
Given the visual space restrictions in the capital will be expected, that would be a existing bahnhof expanded to the hochgeschwindigkeitsnetz.
Bahnexperten say that only st. pancras international or euston this potential.
Lord adonis will be known, whether or not should be continued his view, this plan, but the long - term public consultant - and planungsmaßnahmen mean that a final decision only after the parliamentary elections will be made.
But even if it sets the wheels in movement, the schienennetz in areas must be built.
The trains must first from the hochgeschwindigkeitsstrecken on existing schienenstrecken change in the north of birmingham, leaving the reisezeit between london and scotland continues to more than three hours, would.
This is true as a key rub, thus a change from the plane the rail, can be sure, a richtmaß for the schienenrevolution.

The party udf (union for the french democracy) will energetic and calls for the party nouveau centre on, not to use more their siegel
The party, the by françois bayrou ’ s party has modem monitors will, at the friday on a übernahmeversuch of the siegel 's, the once of valéry giscard d ’ estaing formation party, dwindling of the chairman of the party nouveau centre, hervé morin reacted strongly, and asked him under threat of a judicial persecution, this siegel to use more on no document.
Hervé morin presages publicly his intention to take an, this udf - siegel, because he was the view that françois bayrou would not be deemed to defend, this political legacy, after he have left the hand enough.
The minister of defense, whose parteipartner the ump is, incidentally wanted to this strategy to bear on saturday before the national of nc.
The emphasis his efforts, he had the support of the representatives hervé de charette (ehemalig ump receive, now in nc), the udf makes a claim on the property of the level, because he as first that mark 2004 in the "institute national de la propriété industrial" has requested.
However, the geschäftstelle of françois bayrou 's friends supervised parteienbündnisses udf the silence and, to understand that they are not expropriators, and to use the minister, as well as the representatives under threat of a judicial pursuit of a deadline, to use this siegel is no longer and their property rights to transfer the mark.
They have made in the last days many explanations, that they would propose their political movement, the udf - siegelzu + + to take wrote the party in a, signed by 19 of 24 büromitglieder write, including françois bayrou, and marielle de sarnez, the party modem, as well as the senator jean arthuis of the centrist alliance.
They may also believed, they have the right, the name of this movement + nouveau centre +, the slogans + of today 's udf +, on their political material, as well as the startseite their web site abdrucken.
As they know, they have no right to the use of the siegel 's, declared the secretariat the udf and called for the party nc on, "immediate the noted the called udf of sämtlichem material, as well as by (their) web site to remove."
Also, one of hervé de charette, "the property rights of the an to transfer their legal anspruchsberechtigen."
If they deny this, we will charges against them, to respect the law to speak out, and in order to defend the legitimate rights of the udf members, warned the signatories.
In their write emphasize they that "udf" is a fully - fledged political movement since 1978 and reminder that morin, and its friends "to leave the election," the 2007, in order to create a competing movement, as it had already done other 2002, to "ump" the party to reasons.
So the party has nouveau centre, according to the signatories, no rights, the udf - siegel (union pour la démocratie française) to use.
They continue to remember that the last congress of the three years of accession to the party udf 2007 modem as well as the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material, and moral interests" established by valéry giscard d 'estaing, the movement, has passed.
What hervé de charette are concerned, so, the secretariat fort, "he was at the time, as he claims the brand has, for three years no longer a member of the udf" but the ump.
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent way, by the lack of hinterlegung of the akronyms udf to carry out this for themselves.
Continue to give it concerns, that these recklessness on the best ways is, in turn to a criminal offense, and ironisieren the strategy of nc: "there, but in politics as well as in the life dignified, even to make a name, rather than to try to come from the anonymity, by man, on a name aneignet fraudulent way, the man has no rights."
Affaire liliane bettencourt: françois - marie banier is convicted of exploitation of weakness
The court from nanterre, the friday decided, the artists françois - marie banier judge, to determine whether he, like the daughter of the milliardärin liliane bettencourt claims, has a weak moment of achtzigjährigen exploit, to a part of their wealth to erschleichen.
The 62 - year - old fotograf, which is known for its starfotos, on april 15., and 16. 2010 will need to standing trial for exploitation of weakness, an offense, with a sentence of maximum of three years, and a fines of 375.000 euro is geahndet.
This decision, means that it will give a process in this affaire in fact, the saga france 's dignified is one of the richest families, in the mother and daughter fetzen and at the same time the reins of kosmetikimperiums l' have oréal in hand.
Likewise, however, ordered the 15. strafkammer a medical research on the 87 - year - old liliane bettencourt an, the share of three doctors are carried out.
The erbin and hauptaktionärin by l 'oréal, so far, has refused to such an investigation, especially among the, while the investigation of the prosecutor of nanterre' s conditions.
The friday before the 10. march 2010 appointed doctors to propose a report, in which they clear announce, whether and to what times liliane bettencourt in a state of weakness convicted can have.
I think that they will give these studies.
I will speak with their, declared the lawyer of woman bettencourt, me georges kiejman, after the negotiation.
What the lawyer of françoise bettencourt - meyers, me olivier metzner are concerned, he is very satisfied with the court 's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). the expertise will prove that he has (banier) the old dame manipulated, must protect the man, he reaffirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of liliane bettencourt a criminal charges against françois - marie banier, fotograf and launched allroundkünstler, and accused him, and the weakness of their mother for years, to have exploited, schenkungen of a total of one billion euros in the form of bankschecks, insurance, or gemälden to erschleichen.
Turn had liliane bettencourt always be refuted, to have been manipulated by the photographers stake, it sees as a long - time friend.
Although the court the zulässigkeit of the woman bettencourt - meyers taken complaint testing would have, the plaidoyers of lawyers am friday led to a large familiendebakel.
So, the lawyer of liliane bettencourt on three of his klientin of their notar versandten letters (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) occupations, in which they wrote that they 's husband of françoise bettencourt - meyers wary of.
According to their lawyer added liliane bettencourt this added: "could you please my daughter, saying that i fifteen years, a day - to twice an banier written.
Françoise, i have since its marriage never more can speak. "
The prosecutor of nanterre is again believe that the klägerin had no right to respond so, especially, because a vormundschaftsrichter in the final days their request has refused to a judicial action schutzverfahren against their mother.
Liliane bettencourt "is full rechtsfähig, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right, an their shoes to act, "the vertreterin reaffirmed the prosecutor, marie - christine daubigney.
The court has now determined, a verdict, after the process of zulässigkeit of mme bettencourt - meyers has taken place.
Managers - revolution or the end of the strategic frühaufklärung?
If nothing will change in the leadership of the great french companies, our struggle for the development of the economic intelligence have been in vain...
For over a decade, the administration 's attitude of great companies in terms of its staff, said the position of companies vis - à - vis the consumers before the marketing - revolution: it is to join the personal "values" sets the best, such as it once war on the consumer products from the engineers designed in the work to impose.
By the customers in the center of companies, the marketing - revolution has the policies of the conquest of markets in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separated factors preferences of customers again regularly!
A demobilization of the staff can lead to a lethal demoralization.
The suicides in france telecom, psa or renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, the particularly touched the employees.
These demobilization of negative work on the development of all intellectual functions of the company from, especially to those who r & eund, was more critical is, to those who the economic intelligence.
Indeed, in calls for the ie (intelligence economique = economic intelligence) "of all concerned parties (....), a proaktives action and a future - oriented view"; they claims of the workers a use, which the instructions from the authoritarian managements entirely contradictory.
This is why we call a operating revolution, it is there would, the staff in denmittelpunkt of the concerns of the company to put equals alongside the customers.
The very predetermined benefits internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, like the questionnaire, the orange its lohnempfängern on has, in terms of the management this revolution - stimulate practice?
I fear, unfortunately, they do not.
- initially, because i could find, that the whole fabric in the face of a new situation, after many after all, while the anlangt, mainly to do so,... what it has always done.
Because the authoritarianism, too - one of the pathologies of the growing power - in proportion to the significance of his own failures.
After all, and, because most leaders have a strong simplified idea of human behavior.
Emerged from the great ingenieurschulen is their interpretation of the mechanistisch psychology.
They take by intellectuals comfort, the old behavioristische theory, the recently from the us - american "neuroscience," and reactivated unwittingly was deeply by research institutions and the media widespread.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible, the "levers" (sic) for the engagement of employees to trigger a aktuellein reinforced, le figaro. fr erschienene leaders in a position to a survey of ipsos the mechanistischen steuerungssystem, which is unsuited for today 's world.
The mobilisierungsfaktoren identify and measuring
Instead, a necessary for the smooth functioning of the modern companies operating revolution require the adoption of a final view of the human behavior.
It is, in any consideration to integrate or a fundamental protocol practice of governance: for the wage is the commitment to the company, is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to a part of their dreams, ambitions and its plan to achieve.
Now, only the trials from the multifunktionellen analysis this conception of the motivierung the staff.
These studies have shown that they their companies on the basis of a doxa judge, the set by their perceived picture of the company permits them, to gauge, was it provides them to realizing their life.
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this can mobilisierungsfaktoren the leaders of the companies their "social performance" control, predictions, and imperial predicament, and their human resource management, again in the right place.
So, they create a fertile breeding ground, for the designed development is a robust and efficient economic intelligence favorable.
The speech of oslo: the "just war" brings obama praise from the right one
The american right has the friday on the eve of barack obama in oslo domestic welcomed speech and was happy that the peace 2009 the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the united states has defended.
The conservatives, the allocation of the price had an obama on october 9. mocked, applauded this the president 's speech, the example of the former vizepräsidentschafts - candidate in the following of 2008 sarah palin elections.
I appreciate what he said, palin declared that the face of the right - wing of the republican party in the newspaper us today, and added that they themselves the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoir have brought to language.
The war is, of course, the last, of which i think that the americans want to do it, but he is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists there bottom, she says.
Obama, the two wars inherited from his predecessor, george w. bush has, in the wars in iraq and afghanistan, has the donnerstag in oslo sought to justify the use of force; a way to declare his entscheidungvon nine days ago,, 30,000 to send additional troops to afghanistan.
A other opponents of obama, newt gingrich, when the opinion, the präsdent have done in oslo "very good work".
I found that the speech was really very well, frohlockte of the former president of the house, particularly the pointing to "the existence of evil" in the words of obama 's accepted in the world.
In some parts of habeich that speech at all, perceived as historically, declared ginrich, in the radio, "the takeaway was" months.
The previous mp 's, by some as a possible candidate for the republican nomination to presidential election is viewed 2012, said that he was pleased to a "president of the left" to have seen, the members of the nobel committee reminding, that they were "not frei and a price for the peace could not aushändigen, if the use of force would not exist."
For michael gerson, a former schreiber of george w. bush, and now editor in the washington post, obama has "is a very american" speech.
In addition, that he is as "cosmopolitan", such as "it always power," he has spoken "as an american president," when he suggest that the europeans, "as in a sicherheitsblase life, they have not even created, and for their protection they do not much," so gerson.
Under the few, not convinced right called the former un ambassador, john bolton, a hawk of bush era, the speech on the web site of the national review online as "boring, hochtrabend and inspirationslos."
To the left 's president shows, the democratic representatives dennis kucinich, worried about how barack obama defended the recourse to the armed forces.
Packaged the war under the guise of the judiciary, quite simply, is the massacre in the innocent justify, he warns.
The press the moderate left, however, remains continues to be lobend for the side of the president.
The los angeles times, the still believes that the nobel prize is too early to obama, was, called the speech even for a speaker like him, of the for his talent is, known as "monumental."
The speech in oslo "offers a ablaufplan to manage the international decisions on the conflicts, the poverty and oppression," so the california newspaper enthusiastically.
The new york times, the view that is that obama proclaimed "and" the necessary discourse and revealing also calls his speech as "dire."

The conflict "would have the company very much damage" and "it was to fear that he would affect the holidays, at the end of the year," so bussereau.
The agreement is a lohnsteigerung to 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport), and to 2.9% for the highest lohngruppen (international transport) before.
The stundensatz for workers with the lowest wages also of 8,72 euro rises to 9,06 euro.
"this is not very much, but we are only even small an", so patrice clos (fo).
The activists will now need to block the versorgungszentren, no more.
"it will likely always some recalcitrant, however, the are satisfied with the settlement, not complements," he.
The tlf - chairman philippe grillot spoke of a "good agreement," though it was "difficult, this wage increases in the face of the international competition".
According to him is the increase in euro 170 monthly for the low and 100 - 120 euro for the high lohngruppen.
"this agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the workers," so elevated dumont (cfdt), whereas thierry douine (cftc) spoke of "of a historic integration,".
Richard jaubert (cgt), this expressed about "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement is also the increase in the reisekosten to 3%, as well as the aufrechthaltung of gesamtetats for road transport in the first half of 2010, the will enable in particular, the issue of 13. monatsgehalt and address the modernization of the tarifverträge.

The signature of the tlf allowed it, that the agreement for the first an these organization attached companies, and that they then in the case of a expansion by the arbeitsminister for the entire profession.
This will be the case "" in short time, bussereau insured.
The opposition in the workers can only delay the process.
The association fntr this, a "fraudulent trade," an, because the 100 million euros "were the sector for the balance of a part of the carbon tax is already have been promised."
The state secretary for transport forced us to negotiate, quickly, but not on the basis of a shared analysis, but for the '- esser an the advent of weihnachtstagen not to verdrießen, laments the unostra.
For the association otre threatens the agreement "the small and medium size companies of the industry in the next 12 months to schaufeln" a big grab.

The government, comprising a party, which emerged from the islamist movement is also, regretted the decision.
"we opponieren from principle against the closure of the parties.
The does not resolve the problems, "so energy taner yildiz.
"this is a choice, the bombing of the democratic opening was promoted by the government", so the political marktbeobachter ahmet island.

Stuttgarter bremsklotz
The dimension of stuttgart 21 can be no high enough fronts.
For advocates of the project, it is to "the new, plain and simple heart of europe."
Rightly so. s21 is much more than the tieferlegen a bahnhofs, more than a monströses construction, the city of baden - württembergischen country for a decade in heilloses baustellenchaos will speed.
Stuttgart 21 has emerged from the spirit of the 1980 's years.
Kopfbahnhöfe with gleisen, the in the midst of the city, end of the nineteenth century, then seen as the verkehrstechnische fossils, such as bremsklötze of a modern schienenverkehrs worked, because it once needed enormous amount of time, railway locomotives of down forward umzuspannen.
All, in short, continue to drive - for example, revolution 's.
And so the kopfbahnhöfe should disappear: in frankfurt, and munich.
And in stuttgart: a durchfahrtsbahnhof, the roughly to half - way of the transeuropäischen seemed - magistrale between paris and budapest / bratislava, - - hence the slogan "heart of europe."
S21 now will actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980 's no longer compatible with are of reality.
Even have very ambitious planners recognized that it in the hessischen and the bayrischen großstadt unaffordable fast is to implement the tieferlegen.
Kopfbahnhöfe, however, also have no longer a one - and ausfahrtsproblem, since it is modern wendezüge with triebfahrzeugen and steuerwagen at both ends.
Yet: stuttgart 21 nebst the ice - neubaustrecke after ulm addressed will now.
Country - - and communal have enforced.
The rail, power with, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure - einzelprojekts of the republic of the taxpayers and not the staatskonzern bears.
Städtebaulich can justify the plan still somewhat.
It generates new stadtraum, the - the computergenerierten graphs believes that it is a real - endowed with much green.
For the track, transport is s21 harmful.
The durchgangsbahnhof, and the streckenausbau are for the typical people thought, the man - 1980 's - - huge growth zuschrieb.
Back then, it is not the competition of the billigflieger.
Modern verkehrspolitik, it needs to go but first put to strengthen the güterverkehr, because the transport is significantly environmentally sound than on the track per truck on the street.
But the neubaustrecke both because of intense steigungen are not for güterzüge.
Much more serious threat is that s21 indirectly, many other bahnprojekte tangiert.
Well should six billion euros in the schwäbischen verbuddelt.
This is the official number.
Experts 10 - 15 billion for realistic.
What is clear is, in the next decade will be the money in other knotenpunkten, and engstellen in the net lack.
As a whole sixty larger projects, are on the list of verkehrsministeriums.
One of the most important is the development of the well - 180 - kilometer long wayside by the rheintal.
In 1987, an will trasse in the zeitlupentempo built.
Urgently needed to push would be, here is right to the tube.
But s21 will act as a bremsklotz.
The rheintalstrecke will for the flaschenhals for the international güterverkehr: in the middle of the heart of europe.
Government audit verdict for airport
The landesregierung has in the wiesbadener landtag openly, whether they left behind against the judgment of the hessischen verwaltungsgerichtshofs (vgh) will become the nachtflugverbot go into revision.
The cdu / fdp - coalition experts have dispatched to the more than 400 - page vgh test - judgment juristisch said to be, economics dieter posch (the fdp).

Spd - fraktionschef torsten schäfer - gümbel called for the cdu and the fdp on to return to their made before the election 's promises on a return nachtflugverbot. otherwise is to this as a "wortbruch" values.
It is difficult, if one condemned his must keep their word, said green 's leader, tarek al - wazir in reference to keep the fdp' s campaign slogan "we word."
Minister posch rejected the charge of schäfer - gümbel, the landesregierung attempts, with "rechtsverdreherei and trickserei" yet to come to their nachtflügen.
A specific legal test need their time.
The coalition would not on the basis of a "rapid first impression" operate.
We need a rechtssichere entscheiung, said stephen died (the fdp).
So, as they were constitute the opposition, the testimonies of his faction on the nachtflugverbot never have been.

Rapid election
It was then but everything much faster than thought.
Barely two weeks after the zdf - governing pushed the incumbent editor - in - chief nicholas brender from the present, can the station had a successor.
Yesterday evening wanted to vote for the personalie the body.
As a favorite peter frey, the head of the zdf - - was seen hauptstadtstudios in berlin.
But there was a confirmation of the station for non - officially, in order not anticipating the process.
But is likely to have played a role, the zdf - intendanten markus schächter not continue to damage, this proposal also in the governing should not be upheld.
Frey, schächters candidate, needs support from nine of the 14 gremiummitglieder.
The result of the vote stand in redaktionsschluss these issuing has not yet clear.
Two weeks ago, was schächter with his proposal, the treaty with nicholas brender for another five years to prolong, in the governing failed.
Only seven members languages, for brender, seven opportunity against him. brenders abwahl was a harsh defeat for schächter, however, a erwartbare.
Because the unionsmehrheit in the governing had already signaled weeks before the election, to want to confirm brender not in office.
Had organized opposition to the editor - in - chief of the hessische prime minister roland koch.
With the argument, under brender have the news of the zdf an einschaltquoten lost, rejected he another term of the hochangesehenen chefredakteurs.
Until just before the election, there was so protests, in which the political influence on the zdf was gegeißelt.
Least had even 35 staatsrechtler interfered in the debate, the kochs' s record as a unconstitutional eingeschätzten.
Used it has nothing.

The green people after the abwahl brenders, of the mittwoch even from the branchenblatt medium magazine was elected journalists of the year, a verfassungsklage an.
Kochs widerpart in the governing, the rheinland - pfälzische prime minister kurt beck, declared in the last week, the countries should be the zdf - - staatsvertrag change so that personalvorschläge of the intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A auszug of parteipolitikern from the regulatory bodies of the zdf, but also beck from.
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor peter frey, the governing with a shrewd move had recommended - - by the body immediately after the brender - abwahl fierce criticized for.
Thanks to the belegs could journalistischer independence both schächter without him face for the post of chefredakteurs nominate as well as the governing vote, without in the suspicion, a partisans into office to line.
In the parteiarithmetik will frey already the linksliberalen responsible.

The students in the future should be able to tackle its study also.
In the individual verständigten, they are to reduce the prüfungsbelastungen: fundamentally is to every studienmodul only with a single test companies.
Moreover, is the workload the students and "a realistic and reasonable degree of" be guaranteed.
Politics and higher education, want the recognition of prüfungsleistungen between the academies inside and outside germany 's simplify.
The countries committed to common strukturvorgaben for bachelor - and to make masterstudiengänge more flexible.
From divergent länderregelungen moreover, it should not be.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in june bear culture and uni - rektoren the common dictum from the better studierbarkeit in the words.
It has now been first filled with a concrete content.
Part of the so - called akkreditierungsrat decided, the number of tests to reduce dramatically: "every modul, in the rule with only a test," it is, in a 30 - sides - paper, is part of the the approval of courses new rules.
With the "marked reduction of the prüfungslast," said the akkreditierungsrat - chairman reinhold grimm, should be a "fehlentwicklung be stopped, the studierbarkeit significantly,."
Moreover, is the "studierbarkeit" be "the key criterion" in the future shape.
Module as content are "strictly in response to review", whether "unnecessary einengungen of students in the choice of
Events "would be avoided.
The students have "claim to maintain maneuver, the self enable and promote."
Should apply the rules in the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studiengänge.

The bundesvorstand of the juso - hochschulgruppen has called for the design of educational should no longer be "behind closed doors" of the future minister and a hochschulrektoren can take place.
Even now, after the bildungsstreiks should also the students than "how a wörtchen bystanders."

The countries need to far more teachers.
To a freer access to master expressing, but not the culture.
More than a mere footnote to herta died
Taking in germany, and is beautiful almost no control.... "is the anfangszeile of an gedichts lyrikers werner söllner, in the this in troubling sprachfetzen the ankunftserfahrung of a dissidents, won the freedom, but also has lost its sprachraum.
The 1951 born in the romanian banat werner söllner had first as german - and englischlehrer in bucharest and, later worked in a kinderbuchverlag than lektor before he 1982 to frankfurt in the main übersiedelte.
Söllner he has been excelled with various literaturpreisen in 1993, the legendary frankfurter poetikvorlesungen an the goethe - university, and since 2002, he is head of the hessischen literaturforums in the mousonturm in frankfurt.
For substantial außerliterarisches, he have erupted in the past tuesday during a meeting in munich, in it for the "german literature in romania in the mirror, and zerrspiegel their securitateakten" was.
Obviously unsettled and leave verlas söllner a declaration, in which he rumäniendeutschen schriftstellerkollegen, u. a. richard wagner, william totok, franz hodjak, and helmuth frauendorfer, his cooperation than in the securitate conceded for the romanian intelligence.
Together with some of the present söllner 1989 the germans had sprachpreis preserved.
The anwerbungsversuche schleichend started, first 1971.
I am, finished söllner, "also someone who against intimidation has not enough inherited the securitate."
The lyriker werner söllner is in walter.
Nearly at the same time, with the nobelpreisehrung for herta died and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms diktatorischer rule will the literaturszene, and the community of german authors from romania, in particular through a case, the abgründe and the niedertracht a political system kenntlich power, the based on monitoring and domestic spying.
Werner söllner is, so far to bisherigem knowledge can say, not only perpetrators, but also victims.
In his securitate - acts have played a role in the walter, said after the söllners' s confession of the literaturwissenschaftler michael markel and pointing to the positive influence in the walter for him.
He had him in all for him back then, inexorable points "herausgehauen," so markel.
It is a moral need to make these note.
Söllners declaration was in the form of and before this audience unexpectedly, entirely is surprising is the commitment of a former dissidents, and his cooperation with the romanian intelligence services, however, is not.
Germany is a gemütliches reservat for securitate - spies, herta died had already been written in the july in time, after it had read, their own acts, 914 sides.
The affected, so it should be suspect that speculation and in manchem case may also have known, which klarname behind the decknamen sorin, voicu, and it is also walter masked.
Unlike in the now very verfahrenssicheren here sichtung the stasi - files is dealing with the legacy of the securitate surveillance still very elusive.
A systematic enlightenment is in the past few years have been thwarted and disabled.
A similar national 's advice on manifestation of the work of the birthler - authority securitate - files (cnsas) was established until 1999, but rather the emission of the files passed since then.
Only since 2005, there is a law, which the management of the files governs.
That the influence of former securitate - members in romania, is still very large, finish after the announcement of the nobel prize for herta died an interview, in which a former securitate - chef from temesvar speaks about the preisträgerin said.
They have a psychose interrogated, after all, they only once.
The power said draws the infamy here can to express avowedly in the form of the free speech.
To be sure, forge an the fall söllner, as so often in connection with verschwiegener blame the inevitable questions.
Why is only now? after all, who have been hurt? the sober zuhörenden 's response to söllners commitment is hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than will be determined by blame and shame.
On the genese of the plant of herta died, the yesterday the nobel prize has collected, it is more than a mere footnote.

He gave has incited a certain magic, babbel - advocates jens lehman, "if the football a new impulse is to happen, sometimes things, the man would not for possible."
And sami khedira, in the aftermath of wochenlanger verletzungspause thanks to its dynamism equal to the best players in the place avancierte, sought observed "phenomenon," with the proverbial "new broom" and the workings of the new superiors to describe: "it is a man, the durchgreift and discipline.

Lehmanns statements are "characterized by purem selfishness," keilte heldt back and consequences for the schlussmann announced.
They will be no more friends of life, the two vierzigjährigen.
After all, but they were, with all other agree that without the ground by the abgelöste trainerteam the spielerisch and kämpferisch strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants have "a large share of the success," said heldt and lehman unanimously judged - and the man with the plastiktüte agreed.

By the spd and left demand enlightenment chancellor.
Hamburg / berlin - after the recent knowledge to air attack from kunduz, the opposition has defense karl - theodor to guttenberg (csu) under a deliberate deception.

The chancellor have not taken influence on the bundeswehr concrete action in afghanistan, he said.

Traumwelten
Some see in wachem state images and hear voices, to see the other not or hear.
Not only in the mentally ill and in drogenrausch verschwimmen the borders between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, is anything in order.
If we with closed eyes in our dark zimmern, we must us unbridled 's wildest ideas and phantasiegebilden.
But who in the wachsein experienced traumartige conditions, things, and does not, the other see or hear, holds true in the modern western world mostly as insane, or drogensüchtig, at least as a sonderling.
But such images and voices arise not only in the mentally ill or in the drogenrausch.
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to homes to design, images action or to write novels,, sometimes ensure that the borders between the dream, verschwimmen obsession and the reality.
Traumartig changed wachbewusstseinszustände can occur in the different forms, in the best case, we call in the worst case they visions, obsession.
Even if trigger and effect may be, the different visions of mystikerin hildegard of bingen, the new age - drogenerlebnisse of the prophet carlos castaneda, schamanische entrückungszustände, but psychosis and hallucinations attributable to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise, when the balance of the neural, of the brain - notably dopamin, noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholin - entgleist, and the interaction of various gehirnteile disrupted is.
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thought occur very often during a schizophrenic psychose.
The gravity has no power more about him
The context of madness and physicians since the ancient dream has philosophers, and employment.
Aristotle term hallucinations watch as a form of the dream in the state, wilhelm griesinger, one of the founder of modern psychiatry, konstatierte 1861 a "great resemblance to the irreseins with traumzuständen," the dream of sigmund freud war "in a psychose, with all, wahnbildungen, false of such a puzzle."
It is fall of 2001, when henning t. in a comicfigur.
His body has two and quietschbunt.
The gravity has no power more about him, he is a failure in the zimmerdecke.
He senses a pedal.
Behind him geflügelte teufelsgestalten with blutroten, distorted fratzen, zähnefletschend.
They do him to him with severe, flammenden stiefeln, accuse him against the walls, he feels the pain of the entire body.
Loud, vicious votes dröhnen from wänden and radio.
He endure it can no longer, the vote, the offend him and attack.
Henning t. pulling two kabel from the stereo, knotet them at a schlinge and wire, they to a crux of the ceiling.
It is rising on a lautsprecher and suggests the schlinge around the neck.
Is.
The schlinge triggers.
This is to be a lesson for you cry the vote in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "in the clinic heal and lass you walk!"
Today, henning t. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last two years, the first is almost 20 years.
It was triggered by lsd.
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive - paranoid psychose, moreover, he is a bi - depressed, he is drugs, against the depression, the mania, the schizophrenia.
He has learned to live, with its disease, for three years, he is born.
In the psychose, i have worst fear, and deepest seen despair, he says.
The trugbilder are cruel reality
Roughly 1% of the population sickened at least once an schizophrenia in life, in psychiatric clinics, it will be treated as a second disease after the depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychose affected mostly can no longer distinguish between domestic - - and the outside world, they get in a übererregten state, to the hallucinations that size -, can lead beziehungs - or verfolgungswahn.
Particularly endemic is the stimmenhören - vote, the commenting, or dialogisieren orders.
Optical hallucinations, too, are not rare.
The important affected can no longer of unwichtigem to separate, the brain can disturbing signals will no longer filtering, the consciousness of flooded eindrücken.
As well as the dream opens the psychose the for a spate of ideas, and fantasies, the deeper bewusstseinsschichten come.
The realitätswahrnehmung in the psychose is subjektzentriert, says professor thomas fuchs, oberarzt clinic for universal psychiatry in the universitätsklinikum heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the story, everything has a on him importance.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he, like the dream, overwhelmed by the happened, and it can make not actively.
Schizophrenic feel manipulated so often threatened, and controls.
A realitätsabgleich them mostly is not possible, the trugbilder are excluded harsh reality, wake up.
Even in the life to have experienced a hallucinations
Unlike in the dream, fuchs says, "but remains the sinnliche and räumliche structure of the reality that in the psychose is perceived, fundamentally."
The wahnhaften thought - - and hallucinations were rooted in the reality, the verfremdung of the erlebens is taking place in the real context.
Why just our brain vagaries,, researchers still proposes puzzle.
Ausnahmezustände in every people can lead to that he loses the realitätsbezug briefly, says fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychose.
It appears to be a genetic predispositions to schizophrenia, but zwillingsstudien have shown that the genes are not the determinants alone.
Researchers assumed that embodied in affected minimum brain damage.
We suggest that the neuronal immature fat cells to mature more of the brain is supposedly in an early stage of development, for example, by a viral the mother during the pregnancy, offers fuchs.
But it left a puzzle, like the disruption of the neural systems emerge, for many years, and the first do not manifestiere.
Also environmental play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be catalyst for a psychose, that is, if the disposition capacity.
Halluzinogene drugs, too, can trigger psychosis, because it in the transmittersystem intervention.
If our brain hot is
The verrückte is, psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs, to get rid of them, other spend money on drugs, to get what, says the lübecker psychologieprofessor, erich castes.
Whether trugbilder are perceived as pleasing or unpleasant, is often only a matter of position.
Castes record for ten years, reports of hallucinations and trugerscheinungen, in the past year, he has its results in the book "the irreale world in our head of" ausgewertet.
While hallucinations belong to the typical begleiterscheinungen of psychoses, but also by an astonishing many other diseases.
This includes mental disorders, such as often borderline or depression, along with diseases, such as migraine, epilepsie, multiple sclerosis, or alzheimer 's disease, and schädelhirntraumata.
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions even the brain healthy people.
Hallucinations, so castes, from gedächtnisinhalten combined, usually zurückgehalten will be.
They arise, if areas, in which sinneswahrnehmungen process are discouraged, überaktiv or too little; if our brain hot, or, if stimulation lacks.
Drugs can trigger this state of affairs as like brain damage or a psychose.
But it is also reizentzug, stress, liebeskummer, or other mental ausnahmezustände.
In recent studies, up to one - third of those polled said to have seen a hallucinations, at least once in life.
In the summer of 2005 is sarah k. 16 years old, they reside in a small town in mecklenburg - vorpommern there and go on to finish high school.
A normal girls, in fact.
If it not for the images and vote will be.
In the recess than before it can happen, that a schlaksiger young with long dark hair it appeals.
If it replies, the mitschüler it is surprising - - with no one else look, or, these young.
They keep the timid girls for a versponnene tagträumerin, but sarah k. not dreams, the knows it.
It is wake, it does, and these young people, just as they hear the girl in the bank in addition, and views.
They can even his presence felt, at least for moments.
A light sense is the, they may be the young.
I am crazy?, asks, it is sometimes.
But it knows yes, that the young and the other trugbilder are not real is and over again disappear.
Night are the appearances mostly frightful
The trugbilder also are often a burden.
If they can, sitting in the students they follow the unterrichtsstoff sometimes not, because of the teachers in their eyes and ears just a new mitschüler envision, while it for all the other hör - and visible in the tafel mathematical equations offers.
Night are the appearances mostly frightening.
If they wait in their dark room to sleep, the much too rarely, and much too late, it can often not differ, whether they wake or already dreams, is whether the images, they can see, the fratzen or the girl with the blutenden schnittwunden an poor, and two feet from their open or closed eyes arise.
Let me in calm, they die, an.
Parents and none of this friends told them that they would for crazy.
Fall of 2009, sarah k. today is 20 years old.
It has existed in the last year the abitur and live with their friend together.
A year ago, the hallucinations ceased.
Since they has included in the internet contact to the psychologists castes, they coincided precisely knows that it is not crazy.
Obsession is also a kunstwerk from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering reizentzug, he has with great chances for a while hallucinations, says castes.
I suspect, then the brain is unterbeschäftigt, and even for his entertainment.
Sarah k., a einzelkind, had played a little girl fear of other children, often they alone.
Their hallucinations began, as they learned with 13, the man, the that they can papa calls, since they think, is not their leiblicher father.
Because visuellen and akustischen hallucinations at the same hirnbereiche are active, the real impressions and sounds process, it is also affected as sarah k. hard to see trugbilder and reality to distinguish. "every," says castes, "is taking place in the brain, the reality is there.
Hallucinations are also images that can arise the brain, this is why do they so real. "
Also night traumbilder wertet caste as a form of hallucinations.
The hallucinations of health are not fundamentally different from which an acute psychose.
In contrast to schizophrenic are mentally sound in the position that their trugbilder than irreal to recognize.
So castes rät its patients, the hallucinations also as a special ability wertzuschätzen.
Grenzzustand between the dream and hallucinations
Unfortunately, in our too much bewusstseinszentrierten world will imaginary see mostly pathologisiert, michael schmidt - degenhard, says professor in heidelberg and chefarzt clinic of psychiatry and psychotherapy of florence nightingale - hospital in düsseldorf.
A psychose is a severe, leidvolle disease, but they are also serious positive, creative - mania is also a kunstwerk from despair.
Chancellor schmidt - degenhard has the so - called oneiroide erlebnisform understood, a special form of the traumartig changed wachbewusstseins.
Oneiroide are -, a detailed quasi - dreams that keeps the erlebende for real, and the he also in hindsight cannot distinguish from the wachzustand.
The oneiroide bewusstseinszustand arises in trauma - - or krankheitsbedingten extreme, for example, in polyradikulitis - patients, the full awareness to see a motor of paralysis.
If a man is threatened by self - determination and weltverlust replaced by, for example, persistent, complete bewegungsunfähigkeit, he the life - threatening realsituation by its own, imagined world, the entkoppelt by the reality is, says schmidt - degenhard.
A kind of grenzzustand between the dream and hallucinations.
Because the deal with a situation in the reality is not possible, but finds a weltwechsel rather than, the realsituation will in the imagination vergegenwärtigt.
A intensive form of sinnstiftung and sinngebung in a an unbearable situation, the us people 's own enabled gestaltungsfähigkeit, not in a nothing bewusstseinsverlustes sink.
Everything is real, and then in the memory
And the zürcher kunsthistoriker peter begged cornelius claussen describes his oneiroid - experiences in his book "herzwechsel" as a bailout of the soul.
He is 49 years old, as his awareness for a herzklappenoperation with subsequent herztransplantation days on the road result, on the care is doomed to bewegungslosigkeit during his body.
Claussen opens a in a selbstgeschaffene world, visited foreign times, and places where: he is seen as a bettlägerigen, old man, an board of zugsanatoriums, a robot watched over his health.
He lives in the early part of the middle ages under royal, the rauschmittel of blood.
Will from the greeks on the motorcycle in his native verschleppt, surf with spitalbett in the firnschnee of alpen and is a korean mafioso.
He is entirely on in the imagined, everything is real, also later in the memory.
These internal travel, for claussen fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is a other state experience, he described.
On the contrary, are me the memories of mental travel, after years, and in marginal details abundantly.
Clearer and intense even as a truly erlebtes.
The intensity of this erlebens sprengt the horizon of our other lebensweltlichen experiences, says the psychiatrist schmidt - degenhard.
Ultimately, show oneiroide psychosis, hallucinations and drogenrausch, as well as fragile our internal abbilder of external reality in the guards.
Any change of the bewusstseinszustandes, resümiert the psychologist castes, "can lead to a verformung version of what we call reality."
A experience, as well bereichernd can be.
The schneeeinbruch can come
Burda
Children should take the publisher with 27 years
The new verlagschef kallen is a zwischenlösung: in the long run will be minister hubert burda companies in the hands of his two children, he said the mirror.
The holding is also in future belong to 100% of the family.
Hamburg - the publisher minister hubert burda is his company in the hands of its children in the long run.
Both children inherit with 27 years, and have the fixed will, into the companies, said of the 69 - year - old the mirror.
The details, we have regulated possibility.
The question of whether they are also active in the companies, is only afterwards.
Also the question of whether they are able to do so.
You can 't 7500 employees, its children vorsetzen if they are not enough enabled.
This brings the children around and also the company.
Burda had on january donnerstag announced that he is spineless from the vorstandsvorsitz, leaving and paul - bernhard appointed to kallen as his successor.
The 52 - year - old kallen is board in burda since 1999.
First, he was responsible for technology.
Later came with the area treasury the responsibility for the unternehmensvermögen, and after the exit of jürgen todenhöfer also for direktmarketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time is no familienmitglied at the forefront of the verlages.
Burdas children are 19, and 17 years old, his son felix, died of today 's 42 years old, would be a few years ago.
The object of kallen benefits also to bridge "" 10, 15 years, so burda.
The holding should also future belong to 100% of the family, said burda.
Looking at the cases schickedanz and schaeffler expressed burda that also family are not safe from the death: "the situation was always families, the anstecken had by a kapitalsucht, which is verspekuliert have and thought that they could rise so to all major players.
This was never my strategy.
He had "had never weltmachtträume", so burda.
I do not see me as the country 's political präzeptor, as it was springer, and i will also not in the weltliga with' time 'game, these shops are become too big.
The promises of fonpeek
Peek is äuβerst limitiert, a equipment, with the man can only read his e - mails, without a possibility that they can see some attachments or throughout internet surfen can.
It has enjoyed his five minutes fame, as it chose the journal time to one of the products of the year.
It is to see on the straβe, is unlikely to be, but the idea of an itself is nevertheless, especially for young people of interest.
In contrast to the smartphones costs peek very little and has a very favorable flatrate, for example, only one - half of the price of a flatrate a iphone.
After the company 's success, has seen it brought onto the market: one two new equipment, is the only for twitter thought that other, with a life - long gratisservice for data, unlike the peek, for the man must pay a six higher price.
Fonpeek, the yesterday in the event web, le pen, is the european version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits, as his american counterpart, however, has a surprise any.
The euro monthly unterhaltspreis for the telephone, roughly 12 in the month, involves roaming for all of europe.
Those who with a smartphone travel around the world, already know what it means to renounce all the data, to be read his emails, once the states überfahren, or if you are desperately searching for a café with wifi (or a verbindungsmöglichkeit with fon).
The idea of roamings with flatrate is incredibly tempting and should have long been really be possible.
It is true that some of telefonanbieter have already offer special treaties and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience for one already needs a doktortitel in physics, and a good prism, to be read all the kleingedruckte.
The european commission 's repeated criticism from in terms of affordable roamingtarife for all of europe, almost always slip.
Auβerhalb of their own country, it has always fear of being able to read his emails and the right to.
That a small, such as fonpeek (with it but again and again astonishingly is that it has the name of fon, although it is not a wifi / wlan) possess this kind of savings can offer, means that telefonanbieter slowly, but surely, shifting and need to start various ways in to consider using, as they can use their datennetz.
Kindle is another good example of this, in its prices is the downloaden of books and other requests in the internet services.
Without vetrag and without catch.
It is a internetfähiges equipment and man pays for only a single time, namely to buy, and not month for month.
And it is just that, i was also a day of fonpeek expect, a kaufmöglichkeit with life - long internet as it offers peek is already in the us.
And i 't, because it wants to buy.
I read my emails with the telephone, thanks.
But i am expect this, because i believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumers.
But it would be interesting to see time a computer with the same system.
The fetischfarbe of michelle
Yellow, without doubt, is the lieblingsfarbe of america 's first lady.
Already the office of barack obama, as the president of the us they in a dress appeared, and a mantel this re - elected color, and has the same color to him in his, without doubt, second moment in his life to accompany: the award of the peace in oslo.
It has michelle obama in two occasions very similar models carried: auβer, that it was almost the same color - a leading grüngelb - statements, the clothing from three parts - dress, jacke and mantel from the same stuff -, and that they do something groβförmig contributed gesticktes or a halskette.
Indeed, it is as far as, that it had in the first sight of the appearance, that the first lady of the united states wanted to follow the model of the princess of asturien and decided to the same dress in more than a reason to bear.
However, the two clothes, but very different in the stoffart, from which they are manufactured.
In the inauguration translated them a dress from top and in oslo, a gemusterten including.
The accessoires were also different: in the first time green shoes with halbhohen absätzen, and while the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben.
The frisur also was different: every time the hairs were in that occasion than haarkranz hochgesteckt, in the previous contributed it the hairs openly.
Mothers 75% of the professionals have because of their child get problems in the work
The discrimination in the work has grown in the last few years, especially when the younger want to have women, the children.
To this outcome the of csic survey conducted in cooperation with the institute for women "fertility, and career of women in spain."
The survey of 9.737 women between 15, and can be no doubt about it 75 years: 75% of the professional women see their karrierechancen on the labor market, owing to their child constrained.
The study, openly that it groβe differences in the decision to start a family, and the number of children, depending on whether or not the women work, and if so, what kind of occupation they practice.
Those of them, the auβerhalb of the house no other performing operations, only halbtags work or have no fixed contracts, is more likely to be mothers and have more children.
By contrast, the move women with a fixed employment, especially in the public sphere, the establishment of a family and motherhood, and so have fewer children.
"the women in the age between 35 and 49 years with a fixed employment get their first child in the average only 3.7 years after the zusammenziehen, a number that on 4,1 years for women with fixed employment increased, the longer needed to achieve this, and the zusammenziehen it and the first child have achieved only much later.
Auβerdem has also the kind of work a groβen influence on the child, even less than the calendar about the empfängnisbereitschaft ", explains the csic - forscherin margarita delgado.
The level of education is another factor, of the age of women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account.
According to poll is the old at the time of marriage, and the higher the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be in the same old age women found.
For example, the group, the women were in between 35 and 49 years, depending on, whether they have only the hauptschulabschluss, or a higher education, on average, each with 25,1, or 32,1 mother for the first time.
Moreover, there is still, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women.
While the women with hauptschlussabschluss already from their first festanstellung marriage and their first child, make it get the women with a middle or high school very different look around and only a festanstellung and marry later and get then her first child, delgado is clear.
Diane kruger is worth it is also
L 'oréal paris has recently of his mutually beneideten list of botschafterinnen added a new name: diane kruger.
In the coming year, the german actress will be the mark the image of the different products and also the well - known werbespruch "because they are worth" say.

In the men, the kosmetikfirma also has only ausnahmebotschafter: patrick dempsey ("grey s anatomy '), and matthew fox (schauspielkollege of evangeline in" lost ").

Cowardly aggression
My 70 - year - old mother was by our stadtteil last week, the town of fuenlabrada spazieren between 15, as a suddenly a group of young people and 18 years, along with their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a mischling, we have taken from the animal and the barely six kilograms importantly, and then from the blue missed two - fußtritte and injured him with the hard they him.
Our outrage can you don 't in words root, because it is incomprehensible us, where because because of the spass in a cheap aggression against is to be a small and hilfloses animal, which of course, was an the leash executed.
In addition, nor the erstickungsanfall, a woman, the cozy spazieren had received,, when they these individuals due to the vorfalls wanted to zurechtweisen, they feared even to their own lives, because, if so a wahnsinniger a dog attacked, it will be the same, perhaps, with a woman, a child, make a older mr. or even probable with any, is the weaker than he himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet tor for five clock afternoon in a massive ordinary tuesday.
For the entire day, the dog has geheult.
Of course, we have in a nahgelegenen polizeidienststelle ad erstattet, but we have doubts but large, whether it will bring anything and etwaigen prejudices from the beginning to want to fear that we were only to make clear that the cowardly criminals spaniards.
Our outrage at the geschehene has led us to, these incident.
We can 't understand, was in the minds of these young people' s actions that they must find a cheap attack on a hilfloses animal funny to an animal that the us love, society, and friendship.
We don 't know, where the good education and respect for the animals and have stayed the people.

This initiative will make attention to the importance of the helmgebrauchs, because it is ultimately here is the only schutzelement, the kopfverletzungen, or even can prevent the death in the case of a motorradunfalls.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of their commitment in terms of the verkehrssicherheit, the "far more than just the design and balance of products, the with every passing day always" and affirming will continue to safer, they also with other actions educational and informativen character help, a move closer to every day, this goal.

The sale of kleinlastwagen rising somewhat restored an
After almost two years of the automarkt for kleintransporter finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnels.
The 9.425 vehicle were allowed to die in november in spain, mean a rise of 12,6% in terms of the year, and in 2008, was still more importantly, they are in order to the first increase after 22 at successive months with stetigem decline, gemäβ by the herstellerverband anfac and the autohändlerverband ganvam pay framework.
This good numbers, however, are at the time genieβen only with groβer caution, because the for comparison herangezogenen are referenzdaten of november 2008, a particularly bad verkausjahr with a decline in terms of the previous year war by 60%.
But they must consider that, apart from the rise in the last month, the gesamtzulassungen of this 11 months, still 40% below the sale of the previous geschäftsjahres.
Since january, a total of 95.853 vehicles, sold in this number, however, are all vehicles, from which the kleintransportermarkt is contained,: descendants of passenger, pick - ups, kleintransporter, small delivery, and better kleinlastwagen / fahrgestelle.
Or are still the same storm clouds in the skies, which that demand in the most affect, because even if some of the vehicle be bought by individuals, is the groβteil of sales to small and medium sized firms, the cases in nearly 100% of all the purchase with a drittfinanzierung fundamentals.
So to these restrictions, which must be the result of the zugedrehten geldhahns, the credit institutions are even more factors with einschlieβen, such as the increase in the unemployment rate, or the last of the poor economy.
In this panorama and in the difference to the passenger, have the financial benefits to buy a fahrzeugs of the plan 2000e little help.
This plan, however, is not only for individuals, also self - and small businesses have a right, if it is a kleintransporter to 3.5 tons of with a co2 - ausstoss, the must not exceed 160 gramm per gefahrenen kilometers, want to buy, but the low price speak for themselves.
Had just yesterday again ganvam, that it necessarily from reminded of the state that is needed is also a special attention to this kleinlaster, and, of course, on the industriefahrzeuge (lastkraftwagen and autobusse).
The autohändlervereinigung predicts that for the 2010 a similar year as exactly the past, for which it with a verkaufsausfall (in passenger and suv) from 19% ahead.
The support bremsmanövern in critical in situations is now duty
As it has been in antiblockierbremssystem abs and then as now just with in the stabilitätskontrolle esp happens, the hilfssysteme to slow in emergencies a pflichtausstattung in the european cars.
In fact, they are already duty in all the newly approved passenger and easy kleintransportern, for the rest of the vehicles, a karenzfrist set by the end of february 2011.
The maβnahme decided by the european union, with the aim to improve the protection of fuβgänger, but it bremssysteme because of their work can also help to prevent, many auffahrunfälle.
The task of the notbremsassistenten is, more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical bremsmanövers, which system in terms of the driver that bremsstärke on the brake recognizes, territory.
But is this system this pressure not to the conclusion of.
According to a by the komponentenhersteller for the bosch - vehicle in mandate on investigation, came one - third of the involved in a accident drivers before the zusammenstoss not more, on the brake to act, and the half of them had not with a full force abgebremst.
To 1.100 accidents
By contrast, the bremshilfe affects with maximum force in the braking system and by the bremszeit, and thus also reduces the bremsabstand, the a car at the bremsvorgang zurücklegt.
According to a study by the eu could until each year in 1.100 lethal accidents, in which fuβgänger harm to come to be avoided, if all cars would be endowed with this kind of notbremsassistenten.
It would be even less accidents - man expected to be avoided that any fourth accident with personenschaden could be - as soon as the so - called smart notbremssysteme popular.
Then is the owning automobiles endowed with a system, the (about radar or a kamera) obstacles recognizes, and the drivers warns it at the same time, with a slight pressure on the brakes budgets.
If the driver in response to respond helps the system, the him to increase pressure on the brake, if it would be needed.
If the drivers did not respond to the warning and even if the zusammenstoss is already inevitable, the bremsassistent maximum pressure on the brakes from practices, for this way to keep the damage as low as possible.

Nick reilly, the new head of gm europe, will reach: that the affected side their consent to each individual point of the plans are already in advance.
For this reason, and there can be that the final document, the first the workers, and then the governments of the countries, in which there is works will move forward, will, at the beginning of 2010.
Dementgegen from gm said that there will be in the next few days of a decision about the sale of saab meetings,.
Because it is not surprising that the swedish government has increased the pressure on the american autobauer, so that they make a decision as soon as possible.
Gm, too, with some possible new buyers in touch.
One of these buyers wants to be geely, which may also like buying up volvo, but the option of the dutch manufacturer of the skyper - sportwagen, of the russian group converg backing, has ever - stronger.
If it should come to an agreement with no this buyers, could sell gm some assets of the chinese baic.
The decision to schlieβen, saab at the end of the year, if it is not have been sold by then, will also continue to maintain.
At the tax of the porsche boxster spyder
For the development of their recent and very expensive juwels used the engineers the boxster s as a basis for 80 kilograms and made it, but really him easier to make, which he now only 1.275 kilograms on the economy.
To create so something, they refrained as a first on the automatic aufklappbare rooftop, which was replaced by a zeltleinwanddach with manuellem drive, this alone, one 21 kilograms imposed; thanks to the aluminiumtüren as that of the gt3 used in this model "disappear more" another 15; by the herausnahme of air time 13; auβerdem has shrunk man the kraftstofftank from 64 to 54 liter, thus have been further 7 kilograms imposed; by the einbau of sporting bacquet - sitting still times 12, and with the slight 19 - customs - felgen five bread again.
Then there was also by the renunciation of the audio - system cdr - 30 again six kilograms less and by the exchange of the türgriffe achieved by griffe from stuff the absence of kilograms.
Although he also with the doppelkupplungsgetriebe pdk is available, was the probefahrt with a owning automobiles, with the 6 - conventional carried out handgetriebe, mainly on the smaller landstraβen from california, to bergstrecken, the really very kurvig.
In his driving can only be the note tadellos man him.
The reduction of his access, but no geführtdass he would not more so firmly on the straβe are now.
It is rather the opposite: the case for long we have already no longer a small and easy model probegefahren at the same time, the a but also a sense of groβer security in the curves, even with high speed, is.
He is a small athlete, this able to flex its muscles in a low gang at the time needed to make warm, until we give it the orders, to rasen, to retard to recover, and then to the new everything out of his motor front...
He is all, what he says. the car power, whatever we him with our hands at the lenkrad something, thanks to its guidance, the as kommunikativ, as well as precise is.
And he makes it with the accuracy of a surgeon.
A motorsound for all geschmacksrichtungen
The sound of his v6 boxers with 320 ps (10 more than the boxster s) is utterly failed, and they can still increase with the him 'sport' - - option, as well as through a system that can transform the motorgeräusche, which already already in the panamera came first to use.
The beschleunigungsvermögen is inconceivable brutal, regardless of whether out of the, or renewed accelerate.
The federungen is stark, but not hart or awkward.
The asphalt on the landstraβen, in which we with the boxster spyder busloads, was already fairly damaged, but the car meisterte the schlaglöcher well.
Had the electronic assistants on the entire wayside almost nothing to do anything; and the, even though we in some of these curves ice in the dawn and rollsplitt found in the vormittag.
Up, one can say that it is a ultraleichtes car, a car, with the man has a outrageous fahrspass, as it him otherwise might well rarely, and in him is far more rather than only a small increase in the boxster ss.
The car will come in february, 2010 on the market and 70.831 euro costs.

It was english and teletovic, the mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible.

The alavesen were in the last quarter bloβgestellt and english and san emeterio (60 - 75) people are already an, that they would allow anyone, the victory, the them in the first dreiβig minutes honest deserved to take away again.
However, resigned pnini and eidson, the best of their team not and tried to their team again by three issues of the line (70 - 77) to be force.
Nevertheless, and, while splitter for fouls from the place was put, the team of ivanovic not to defended, good and, while the israelis have been in the last minute aufholten (80 - 85), had already lost a winner and tel aviv the game for the first time in this season.

The team from málaga had not fear the mood in the halle of peace and friendship before the opposing team, europe 's perhaps one of the strongest, and a lot of money.
Thanks to its dargebotenen game in first quarter of the andalusians allowed to start to dream. a aggresive verteidung and three consecutive three, two of them by omar. cook and a guillem rubio, ignored the host with 12 - 18 - in the 9. minute.
Olympiacos was the intensity of the ereins unicaja surprised, even if the domestic team with a innenspiel between bourousis, vujcic and schortsanitis managed, that the anzeigentafel in the 13. anzeigte minute 22 - 20 in their favor, the minute, owing to a action in the fast to the schlägerei between the two americans would come beverley and williams, and so both were too.
The greek team began to be an, finally warm and its superiority on both spielhälften, while the exit of the engländers joel freeland due to a violation and the three even caused mistake of carlos jiménez clear evidence at unicaja hinterlieβen.

After the enticing days since vergangenem spring, in which the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, is on the markets returned the uncertainty, was in no case is surprising, because this their natural state of affairs is, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a inherently uncertain future.
The to stabilize the markets angewendete maβnahme, it was, the debt to pay off with the direktkauf of assets and indirectly the supply of liquidity free hand to be on interest rates, the to move to the zero, so that the banks assets to buy abrechnen in this way.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direktkäufe of assets as well as, and ended, without their heterodox policies to liquidity in question, to begin, something to diversify sand in the wheels, as the bce näc already taking place vormachte, with their jahresversteigerung, the next week.
So the investors an doubt the ability of the global economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox maβnahmen maintain, and we will just witnesses a reversal in reducing the risk premia.
The flüchtigkeiten of stock markets, and the differences in the unternehmensboni rise again, even if they are still far away from the paranormalen equivalents, which reached it to the beginning of the year.
The states saw is being forced to nationalize the risks private and public debt rise again.
Man, now back up to the quality and the us, japan, and germany are the preferred haven investors, which in turn to a increase differences leads the euro - zone countries in ways to germany.
Spain was until now hardly hit by this episode of instability, but then came standard & poor 's and threatened with a new revision down about the value of spain.
Hurt on the other hand, not a certain insecurity, to bring to silence the defender of the moral hazard, the again had sought in the responsibility of the global economic caused a awareness, for what they had to produce, because they are devastating effects, to which the limitation of credit led to the loss of jobs, abgebremst had, as they actually a new day to the dankesaktion beschlieβen should have.
Nonetheless, the, is what has happened in dubai, to a stammeskrieg between the emiren, to restore the power in the emirates and the development in greece has also been foresaw before.
A government, which the public debt, verschweigt, elections, and a new government, the draws on the same side.
Prodi made it after berlusconi in italy, and sócrates in portugal after durão barroso.
It makes no sense that ecofin hungary the beginning of the year from the non - saving their auslandszahlungen and thus a euro member state council, meet its obligations no longer.
By contrast, it is imperative that ecofin the greek government has forced to do so, in the need to be transparent and its citizens of auβergewöhnlicchen maβnahmen with in the duty to take to the stability of government funds to sustain.
Yes, we are facing a episode of normalization of risk premia as expected, after a few ausschweifungen amounts to high, this would now lie within the expected.
In the case of spain 's man must not to worry, as long as the differences in public, with the same rate as the european unternehmensboni increase.
But should reduce the european differences, and the spanish further increase, dannn here, it is a special spanisches risk would act.
The standard & poor 's is a farce. while the hiesigen snap indicators a groβteil the marktforschungsinstitute forced to do so, their scenarios preferable for the recovery, and their scenario for 2011 upward to correct, einschlieβlich of the ocde and the european commission' s with a japanese scenario for the spanish 's economy come promises, all of this despite warnings no long lifespan.
Again, there has been the appearance of all, that it is a great opportunity to buy spanish stocks, while the moment "caution is in the drive" in.
Ceding branches
The head of iberdrola yesterday, ignacio sánchez galán, joined the first before the unterausschuss of the parliament, where in these days in terms of energy supplies, spain 's strategy will debate in the next two decades.

His proposal is focused on both gas - and kohlewerke with institutions to sterilize the carbon dioxide, and, of course, especially on the renewable energy.
In this case is he going to assume that 18,000 mw more will be needed, under the vorraussetzungnatürlich by other "stützenergien."
Galán, of the view is that the gesetentwurf for a sustainable economy, just passed by the government has, on a line with the ist, was called for his company, has not fall, wanted to say anything against the law, like to create incentives for the national kohleverbrauch, was just the opposite of all political policies in the fight against the climate change would be.
His view, ", man in the long - term clear on this direction, despite some" individual, "maβnahmen, as it is the head of iberdrola called.
Is it as it is, says galán, that man is already the decisions to make the investment, and when they are in the long run, should be, because it will take some time, and a stable vergütungsrahmen, must be created to take it in attack.
