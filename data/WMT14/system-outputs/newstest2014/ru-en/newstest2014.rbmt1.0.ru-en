Germany in Europe first introduces “indeterminate gender” with the registration of the children
Germany will become the first country in Europe, where it will be permitted with the registration of children, who were being born by hermaphrodites, instead of the masculine or feminine sex indicate “that not determined”.
The parents of child will have the right to the period to leave graph “gender” in the evidence about the generation of that not filled.
Instead of “F” (feminine sex) or “M” (masculine sex) the parents can to the period write down “X” (not determined).
This solution is directed toward that in order not to push slightly parents to the hurry with the operation on “the refinement” of gender.
Accordingly to statistics, one of 2,000 newborns is in the world born by hermaphrodite.
Anger because of the sentence to the organizers of act of terror in Bali
Remained among the living and the relatives of 202 of those been killed as a result of the bomb blast in Bali in 2002 angrily reacted to the sentence, carried out to the latter from the conspirators, which appeared before the court, and they stated that Umar Patek must be shot.
Patek, which conducted almost 10 years in the runs as one of the most searched for people in southeastern Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years of the deprivation of freedom for its role in the creation of the explosive devices, used during the act of terror.
It can be freed for 15 years, if conditional--early release is obtained.
45-year-old defendant was acknowledged guilty of the mass murders as a result of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist region of Kuta, in course of which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and were injured ten more.
It was also acknowledged guilty on a number of other connected with the terrorism charges, including of the wave of the explosions of churches throughout entire Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Attorneys required lifelong period, although they could insist, that the person, called “by demolisher” for his reputation of master for the production of explosive devices, must be sentenced to capital punishment.
This solution aggravated the painful memories of the mother from Perthes of June Cortin, who lost her 39-year daughter-twins of Jane and Jenny in the act of terror, realized Patekom and by its accomplices of almost ten years ago.
Hardly holding in control tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to capital punishment.
“I actually consider that he must follow on the feet of other fellows.
It must appear before the rasstrelnoy command, said Mrs. cortin of AAP.
— I must live each day, knowing that I no longer will not have grandsons and I will not see my daughters”.
The club “of Sari” was destroyed, when was set in action the massive explosive device, placed into the parked outside van, immediately after 11 in the evening on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the bar “of Peddi”, where the suicide bomber exploded the knapsack, stuffed by explosive, only 20 seconds are earlier.
After this act of terror it for the month is hollow into the coma and “died” three times by, being connected to life-support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek must divide the lot of other three members of terrorist cell “Dzhemaa Islamiya”, critical for the bloody slaughter, Amrozi, Mukhlasa and the imam of Samudry, which were executed four years ago.
Actually, this fellow deserves capital punishment of more than all.
To preserve to it life, well, there are no reasons whatever to preserve to it life.
To obtain 20 years after killed 202 people and wounded hundred — this is not so is much.
Patek is the latter from participants in the act of terror in by Bali, which appeared before the court.
It was hidden for the almost ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city Abbottabad, where the American troops killed the former head “of Al-Qaeda” Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the legal proceedings the FED showed that the data of reconnaissance testified: Patek was in Pakistan in order to meet with bin Laden in an attempt at to restore the connections between the terrorist groups of southeastern Asia and “Al-Qaeda”.
“It was not returned”, said Mrs. cortin.
Until recently it completely did not regret about that, how much grief it caused to other people.
Sentence is carried out on the threshold of the 10th anniversary of act of terror, which will be noted more lately in this year in Bali and Australia.
“In this year there will be many tears”, says Mrs. cortin.
Patek still can appeal its sentence.
Medvedev calculates, that the aircraft SSJ-100 will be supplied Europe
Russia calculates, that after fastening on the markets of Latin America and Asia the aircraft of Superjet 100 will be supplied, also, into Europe.
“We rely on the fact that on the whole we will obtain such understandings more than to 170 versions of similar type aircraft”, it gives “Interfax” of the word of the Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, told them at the press conference with the Premier of France Jean-Mark Eyre.
The head of Russian government noted that the serious collaboration is fixed with the French colleagues, since this is joint project.
We today discussed some financial questions, which were connected with the insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft will be strengthened on the markets of Latin America and in the Asian-Pacific region, it will be also supplied to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that it will be sometimes supplied, also, into France”, emphasized Russian Premier.
SSJ-100 - the aircraft, built by company “commercial airplanes of dry” in the partnership from Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner is developed on the basis of contemporary technologies and proposes the high standards of quality and comfort in the segment in 100 passenger places.
The goalkeeper “of Chicago” Nikolai Khabibulin emphasized: he understands, that it must play better.
According to the 40-year Russian, it will continue zealous to work during the trainings.
In the last two meetings “of the hawks” of Khabibulin it first passed six washers from “Tampa Bay”, and then four - from “Ottawa”, moreover in the second game it was substituted after the fourth passed washer.
We must play well, but into the last two games this did not succeed for me, gives CSNChicago the word of Khabibulina.
- I should find confidence on the trainings, probably is worth approaching them as to the games, and try to reach the best result.
You must study your passed games and work above those deficiencies, which were.
There are several small components, which I should improve, but I feel itself completely properly during the trainings.
But for some reason after several heads everything is converted into some snowball.
Possibly, I should a little be weakened.
Goalkeepers - I do not think that I this one - always try to conduct ideal game.
If I pass four, five, six, I not in the enthusiasm.
It is unimportant that it occurs before my gates.
I as before work at itself in order not to pass so many washers.
It is healthy, that my odnoklubniki are supported, but in principle everything is simple: I must play better.
Two games - this is not entire season, but I wanted to conduct them considerably better.
But it happened, which happened.
I must put this aside.
I simply will try to win back the following match better.
Power engineering of Dnepropetrovshchiny they began unique program on rescuing… of the nests of the storks
In the old times in order to privadit to the court of storks, peasants in the high post installed wheel from the cart, and heavy nest on it was held well.
Such special supports have not for a long time they placed; therefore storks chose the posts of electric power lines - the interlaced branches rest on the wires, aistinyy house stands reliably thanks to which.
The grandmother of Anya, near house of which in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovskogo region already of years twenty lives aistinaya family, began to note, as nest it settles, in spite of all efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds place from above new twigs, and lower layer already sagged between the wires, any minute now it will collapse.
Certainly, it is pitiful the family of the storks, that each year nested in podvorya, they derived and brought up in the summer of three-four fledglings, even without to remain it is not desirable light.
As soon as bird they flew away into the warm of edge, the grandmother of Anya rang into Tsarichanskiy RES, to which the support belongs.
And even it did not expect that there they will react so rapidly.
When our specialists arrived into Ivanovku, they were astonished, that the nest generally still is held, described the technical director of DTEK “Dneprooblenergo” Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which proved to be, in the essence, already inside the nest, the weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
At any moment of bird they could die from the electrical discharge.
Yes even local residents risked to remain without the light because of the wire fault.
Therefore linear fitters began recovery operation of nest, moreover no longer for the first time in our practice.
The learned ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk national university, who developed the carry circuit of nest, helped.
They conducted trainings for the colleagues of transmission networks.
Known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted power engineers in all stages of reconstruction of nests.
They calculated for the beginning, that in the region in emergency state are more than 50 aistinykh “apartments”.
For their reconstruction the special metallic platforms, which resemble funnel, were welded.
They braided basis by willow branches, and then they transferred there old nest.
In the opinion of the experts, it suffices to pack old branches as the basis so that the birds would learn nest and would return to it.
Already then storks themselves will finish building their dwelling.
Month ago in the village the sand eel of Novomoskovsk region was reconstructed the first nest.
Next to the electro-support they placed new ferroconcrete post and placed platform with old, already settled nest on it.
Entire operation managed to power engineers into nine thousand 10 kopecks.
But recently the same new home took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovskogo region on podvore of the grandmother of Ani.
They here fastened platform at the previous place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are assured that the careful, conservative birds even will not note in spring that their “apartment” underwent innovation repair.
Before the end of the year the same reconstruction expects four additional nests in Pokrovskiy and Tsarichanskom the Dnepropetrovshchiny regions.
By the way, until some save rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
Sad news recently flew around entire region - in the village Ust'-Kamenka the Apostolovskogo region, during the opening day of hunting the pheasants, the poachers for the entertainment shot swan family, which dwelled on the local to pond.
Noble birds in no way feared people - their local residents fed and did not offend.
When villagers, after hearing shots, came running to the pond, four handsome man-swans already lay on the water dead.
Now the colleagues of Apostolovskogo rayotdela of the police explain, who shot at the birds, carried into the Red Book.

Vitallium Mutko: Jets?
It seems me, we years to 15 back returned.
The minister of sport Vitalius Mutko expressed his opinion about the disorders on the platforms during the match of the Russian Cup “tire worker” - “Spartacus”.
I am the supporter of that so that the organizers of the sport events would answer for all this: clubs, league, the RFS [Russian Football Union].
But we-that we see that they engaged drguyu position.
They wait, that will arrive someone from the side and will direct order.
These are very good position, but is not entirely correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs must invite their stewards, but not release the matter to the drift.
We now developed the special decision of government about the rules of behavior on the stadiums.
After it will be accepted, we will close study this problem.
But I still necessarily will invite to itself all organizers of football process.
I gave Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, it is said, give the law of pobystrey.
, That this the fans “of Bavaria” to Yaroslavl' arrived and all this arranged such sensation.
But we are strange observers.
But generally this is terrible - to see, as platform pours on from the fire pump.
And this in the country, which is prepared for the world championship.
“I have sensation, that we to 10-15 years ago returned”, said Mutko.
The lawyer with the cocaine dependence, who warned the head of criminal group about the police investigation, was concluded in the prison
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information to criminal authority to the Nile Skarboro
Attorney feared, that his secret narcotic dependence will be opened
It was sentenced to three years of the imprisonment by Liverpool royal court.
The prestigious attorney, who described to drug baron about the large police investigation, because it feared disclosure by its secret of narcotic dependence, it was concluded in the prison for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred to criminal authority to the Nile Skarboro secret information about the investigation of his activity in drug trafficking after it proved to be under the threat because of its cocaine dependence.
Attorney, who received the nickname of Bash and called among the criminals “steep attorney”, was arrested at home in 2011 after police operation on the shadowing for Skarboro, which he presented earlier on the court, connected with the narcotics.
Officers noted, as 32-year Skarboro left three small packets with cocaine in the house of attorney in the city Blackburn county lancashire, until that is at supper of bar association with the colleagues.
Consequence revealed, that Ditta “regularly used” the narcotic of class A, after tests showed the traces of cocaine in its hair, on its wallet and on the credit cards.
In the course of eight months from January to August 2011 it attempted to illegally obtain information about arrests two people on the commission Skarboro, and also one of his accomplices.
All four suspected were found at this time under the observation of the police within the framework of the scale investigation of the activity of criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in lancashire, Kambrii, Mersisayde, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 additional people were later concluded in the prison after the police it withdrew in the course of a series of raids heroin and cocaine for the sum of £1,5 of million and also more than £200.000 available.
42-year-old Ditta transferred information to criminals because of the fear, that its cocaine dependence will be opened.
Today in the Liverpool royal court Ditta, which works in the juridical company of Forbes Solicitors, which is located in Blackburn, was covered with disgrace after the acknowledgement of its guilt in two cases of the intentional preventing to the realization of justice on the sums of three-week court in the Liverpool court of crown.
It acknowledged in the storage of cocaine on one of the previous judicial sessions.
The disclosure of lawyer occurred after the police, which investigates activity Skarboro, it explained that he regularly talked from Ditta on the telephone since February 2011.
They traced two detectives that suspected and revealed, as it approached the house of Ditta in Blackburn and placed the narcotics of 60-percent cleanliness in the black glove for the golf under the debris boxes of lawyer.
Soon after transfer Skarboro is repeated of sozvanivalsya from Ditta, which was found at supper on the football stadium of Ivud the park of command “Blackburn Rovers”.
Lawyer returned home after the narcotics; between them took place nine conversations.
Court learned about the fact that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine, after tests revealed the traces of the narcotic of class A in its hair, purse and on its credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested; however, denied the use of cocaine, said that he talked with the suspected dealer, since that was its client, and it insisted on what their communication composes “legal secret”.
During its detention of Ditta took its wallet and it attempted to take out several credit cards; however, they all were confiscated, in it the model of hair was also undertaken.
On the examination in the police he said that together with the job, he had and the home office, and clients they came to it home in the juridical matters.
However, court became known that after important arrests it rang to the most important participants in drug trafficking, whose number it previously represented in the court in order to describe that the detectives know about them.
In the speech for the prosecution Anne White she said: “If someone knows that one ought not to break rule, then this is attorney in the criminal cases”.
Mr. Ditta is charged with the abuse of her position of attorney in the criminal cases, since he entered the too close relations with the specific clients.
The contact, about which we speak, this not is not simple drug dealer, but drug dealer, who supplies with the narcotics of his own attorney.
Some of its conversations will undoubtedly prove to be legitimate, since it was their attorney.
However, this to a considerable degree crossed the boundaries of the usual attitudes of attorney and client.
It prevented the police investigation so strongly, as this is possible in order to allow these persons to continue its criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta did not honor her profession, but he disgraced it.
It too drew together with the specific clients, in particular Skarboro, and it made it possible to doubt its nezainteresovannosti.
Ditta it did not recognize fault and stated: “If I was the corrupted attorney, whom I am not, and he would want to transmit information to Mr. Skarboro, I would not wait 15 hours, I would make this without delay”.
But senior officer whether Kholsted from the police of lancashire stated after session: “Mr. Ditta became from the attorney in the criminal cases criminal, as soon as he began to acquire narcotics in the representatives of the organized criminality”.
Its predilection to cocaine made its hopeless compromised and vulnerable for purposes chief participants in the criminal groups, which charged to it to acquire valuable information about the police investigations.
Attorneys must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and suggest confidence and confidence to society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and attempted to cover by her profession.
The investigation on business of Mr. Ditt conducted the subdivision of lancashire according to the especially dangerous organized criminality, which already attained for it sentence on three cases of storing cocaine, and now also on the preventing to the realization of justice, demonstrating our tendency to attain just punishment for the criminals.
Let this matter serve as warning for the criminals about that which no one is located out of the reach of law.
We will find you and will draw to the judicial responsibility.
Itself Skarboro was condemned to 14 years after the acknowledgement of its fault in the agreement for the purpose of the delivery of heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
35 additional people, that participated in the machination, were in total sentenced to 153 years for the crimes, connected with the narcotics.
On its site of Ditta it organized the conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he indicates that the work of its dream — this is attorney, who represents clients with the death sentence in America, ideal companion for it after supper — Muhammad Ali, and motivation in the work — this is inequality.
The producers of jet aircraft quarrel apropos of the width of the seat, when for konu the large orders
The bitter heated argument apropos of the width of the seats of tourist class on the distant voyages developed itself between the chief producers of aircraft, assigning tone for the bitter confrontation at the Dubai air show in this month.
Dispute is twirled around the width of the seats, given on the dalnemagistralnykh voyages to the passengers of economy-class, whose interests are not always the center stage of airlines, with the fact that the volume chosen space of chosen for them plays key role in the assertions about the effectiveness of the last aircraft, proposed to Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus on this week called to the introduction of the branch standard, which would provide for the width of seat not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in the salons of economy-class, but its basic American competitor of Boeing says that this they must solve airlines.
Dispute goes when the producers of aircraft compete in sales ever larger versions of their twin-engined dalnemagistralnykh aircraft, and on measure 17 on November 21 are expected potentially record orders.
The layout of the tail end of the aircraft — especially that, do sit 9 or 10 people in a number — occupies central place in the statements about the economic effectiveness of the new designs “of mini--air buses”.
Boeing asserts that it updated by 777X will contain 406 people, on the basis of the seats in the economic class more than 17 inches into the width, placed on 10 in each number.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy-class 350 people on the seats by the width of 18 inches, located on 9 in a number.
The giants of aircraft construction are frequently exchanged impacts on technical questions with the aid of the advertisement in the professional press.
But now Airbus turns directly to the community before air show in Dubai, where 777X, as it is expected, he will become leader with more than 100 orders.
It recently demonstrated, what the beginning of new advertising war can be, after showing financiers the slide, which depicts three people in the restaurant, forced against each other, by the name “you would agree to this?”
“Boeing proposes dalnemagistralnye flights on the seats of narrower than in regional turboprop aircraft”, said the leader of sales Airbus John Likhya.
With a change in the food ration the people collect weight, but aircraft seats radically did not change.
Between the beginning of the 1970's, when wide-body Boeing 747 assigned the standards of contemporary distant journeys, and boundary of century the weight of average American man at the age from 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the department of public health of the USA.
The grasp of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to the statistical data of health services of the USA.
Airbus asserts that its competitor adheres to the concept of the seats 1950-X of the years, when the average grasp of the waist of those, whom they recently named “reactive public”, was already.
Airbus indicates that ordered the study, which testifies that additional in the width of seat improves the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus according to the sizes of seats and indicates that for producers it is not worthwhile to interfere in the solutions about how to airlines to find the balance between the tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, studies show that convenience in the salon depends not only on the width of seat.
“Everything in reality is reduced to the assignment to the airlines of selection and opportunity to make that the fact that in their opinion they must make for achievement success”, said the specialist of Boeing in the salons Kent Kreyver.
They do not want so that we would decide for them, which will bring profit to them.
They know their matter better than someone still.
For the passengers a question consists of an increase in the space along the sides, but for the suppliers this increasingly more frequently it becomes the factor, which can influence profit.
The race after the orders for the aircraft, evaluated at least in $700 billion on the catalog prices in the next decades stands after this dispute — it is sufficient in order to change the relationship of American and European export.
As for the first time reported in July the Reuters News Agency, seat direction — this precisely that which preheats rivalry in the battle between the newest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing declare about a 20th-percent increase in the profitableness by one place in their last twin-engined dalnemagistralnykh models in comparison with the leader of market in this segment, to 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partially based on the comparison of 10th-local numbers 777X with the original 9-seat layout of numbers of constructive solution of 777.
Gain in the specific prime cost is reduced with the comparison with the 10th-local layout, utilized at present.
“The reason, for which Boeing makes this, it lies in the fact that to squeeze more than places and to make a friendly aircraft more competitive in comparison with our developments”, said Kevin Keniston, head of the division of the comfort of the passengers of Airbus in Europe.
From the other side, the analysts say that the salons with complete 10th-local numbers for existing 777-X indicate that many passengers prefer the dense planting, which can go hand to hand with the lower tariffs.
“Seats with the width of eighteen inches would be ideal for the passengers, but reality was such, that from a commercial point of view the proposal of Airbus is caused by threat from the side 777-y of model”, she said the specialist in the interior of the salon of Mary Kirbi, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply armchair, but they propose the catalog of suppliers, from which the airlines can select.
Salesmen of jet aircraft the travelling around the world even convey with themselves tape-measures in order to check the competing plannings.
Praising comfort, all producers also propose aircraft with the very dense layout of salon for the budget airlines and regional overflights.
Airbus proposes A350 with 10th-local numbers, but he indicates that it still did not sell it.
Until recently Airbus emphasized the need for the additional modifications of salons, proposing wider places in passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of other only producer of large contemporary aircraft, as experts speak, its call to the new branch standard hardly “will take off”, but it can distract attention from the wave of sales to model 777X.
Oleynikov: third of rural settlements of the Moscow area the completely subsidy
The vice-governor of the Moscow area Yuri Oleynikov stated that almost third of rural settlements of Moscow region are completely subsidy
Entire grants from the budget of region obtain 187 settlements of 288.
In 2013 187 settlements from 288 obtain grants from the provincial budget.
The specific weight of grants into the volume of the incomes of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 hundred per-cent subsidy.
Within the framework of the budget security from the provincial budget it is sent the order of 25 billion rubles”, it said Oleynikov.
Also vice-governor noted that only in three boroughs - Mytishchi, Odintsov and Pushkin - the volume of the incomes of budget comprises more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The incomes of the rural settlements of many regions are less than 3 million rubles, “this in no way is sufficient”.
More than 70% compose expenditures for the maintenance of local administrative and managerial apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow area, “in this case is observed reduction in the quality of services”, it noted Oleynikov.
Earlier it charged to the heads of the municipal formations of the Moscow area to the end of November to think over, what settlements need coarsening, association into the urban districts or a change of the system of executive management.
These proposals will be worked out toward the end of January.
Thus far the governor of Moscow region stated that within the framework of the administrative reform in the Moscow area it is planned to decrease a quantity of subsidy rural settlements.
Also in by Mozhaisk, Kashira, by Solnechnogorsk, Kolomna regions, Lyubertsakh and boilermakers there is request for coarsening of municipalities.
Discussion of this question in cities and regions of region will begin in November.
The chairman of Mosobldumy Igor Bryntsalov stated also that in all to combine within the framework of future admreformy are planned about 30 rural settlements in 12 regions of the Moscow area.
Is connected this with the fact that from 178 rural settlements to the Moscow area less than third have “acceptable” financial base, and 100 - subsidy.
Concern about the safety in Mozambique increases as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the looking on them from top to bottom statue of Samory Mashela, the President-founder of Mozambique, thousand of people were collected in the center of Maputo in order to scan slogans about peace on one of the rare here demonstrations.
“We want the return of peace; we want stability”, said Vanessa de-Susa, the executive director of investment company.
Fearing for the future its country, it replaced business suit to the sports shirt, decorated with inscription “we it was required safety” in the Portuguese, and it was joined on Thursday to the crowd over the capital area of independence.
During two weeks entered practically daily communications about the collisions between the government troops and Renamo — this some of the most brutal skirmishes from the time of conclusion of truce are more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once the known insurgency, which was supported by the first white authorities of Rhodesia, and then by government of South Africa the epoch of apartheid within the framework of the efforts for the destabilization of the independent government of the country.
After the truce of 1992 it became opposition party.
Analysts assume that the country hardly will again roll down to the full-scale conflict; however, recent events forced to ponervnichat foreign investors and local residents.
Rates are high for the rapidly-growing economy, since the discovery of the enormous shelf reserves of gas and carbon layers in the northwest can draw more than $50 billion as the investments into next few years from such companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
Ruling party Frelimo, leading political force since 1975, and party Renamo charge each other with the created tension.
Party Renamo asserts that the government became the instigator of last collisions, attacking its terms in the province of Sofala, traditional stronghold Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on the former rebels then aggravated, when the government troops attacked bases Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso to Dkhlakamu — leader of group, reported to the newspaper of Financial Times Fenando Mazanga, representative Renamo.
Government blames Renamo in the initiation of collisions, charging party with the attack on the soldiers.
The President to Armandu Gebuza attempted to scatter fears apropos of the instability.
Gebuza stated AFP, French information agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt himself “by an unlucky person”, who wanted to use “everything which remained from his forces in order to attempt to prove that it can impose on government its own solutions”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist on what they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after communication, that Mazanga stated about the failure Renamo of the peace accord of 1992.
It reported to Financial Times that had the nonobservance of agreement by party Frelimo.
“Our purpose - to return to the negotiations, but with the entire seriousness”, said Mazanga.
Previous negotiations between the parties little made for weakening of tension, which strengthened a series of collisions in this year.
“This two influential persons (Gebuza and Dkhlakama), that were collided by foreheads”, said Joseph Khanlon, the lecturer of the open university and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is prepared to go for the necessary concessions.
The party Renamo, which attempts to attain selective reforms, already stated, that it will boycott the municipal elections, assigned in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the following year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as the attempt of the weakened motion to attain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The portion of votees in favor Renamo is reduced since 1992, whereas the new party — democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based with the former term Renamo, as it is expected, it will improve its indices on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Gebuz, who must leave from the post in the following year, when its second period ends, he wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace, because he does not want to leave the post of the President”, said Mazanga.
It is unclear, what opportunities possesses Renamo; however, it already carried out destructive and swift attacks on the police stations and automobiles on the key highway, which leads from the north to the south.
The majority of skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is located in several hundred kilometers to the north of Maputo, but is included Beyru — the port, which the mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use in order to export coal.
In June Rio stopped the use of railway lines approximately to the week after Renamo it threatened with attack on the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive, when to it they presented the question about that, will repeat Renamo this threat.
Party Renamo wanted “to warn the international community about the fact that the matters in Mozambique go not very well”, said Mazanga.
Instability strengthened dissatisfaction with government, and many people also disturbs corruption, slow rate of development and hostage taking increased in frequency recently, speaks Fenando Lima, the head of independent mediakompanii of Mediacoop.
“People think that responsibility for country future they bear government and the President, who must find the solution of these problems”, he says.
Omar Sultuan, participant in the demonstration, said that people simply want stability.
“No one disturb either Renamo or Frelimo, they simply want the renewal of peace, they want free access to the roads”, he said.

To the passengers of Australian airlines will have and to further turn off its tablets and Smartphones during the takeoff and landing, in spite of the measures in the USA for the softening of the rules, which are concerned the data of devices.
Federal aviation administration of the USA allowed American ferrymen to change their procedures in such a way that the passengers could read e-books, look video or play in the games on their devices during the takeoff and landings when those will remain in “the flight conditions”.
Passengers already can do this during major portion of the flight, but it irritates many, that they do not have a access to their e-books during the takeoff and landing.
Australian ferrymen examine this solution, which required from the American airlines to conduct the huge amount of work for correspondence to new requirements, but they indicated that they do not plan to in the near future change their procedures.
In the administration of the flight safety of civil aviation they also noted that they examine this statement, but they emphasized that the limitations to the use of electronic devices in the critical flight phases still act in Australia.
“The administration of the flight safety of civil aviation does not at present have the special rules, which regulate the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, it stated.
This question is regulated by the rules, which require airs carrier to ensure the maintenance of safety at any time, and from the passengers — to observe the safety regulations, about which by it report the crew members.
The company of Virgin, which already discussed with the administration of the flight safety of civil aviation the expansion of use on board its entertaining system from Wi-Fi, was not against the changes, but she stated that it will follow the indications of regulator.
“We would greet examination by the administration of the flight safety of civil aviation of a question about the permission of the use of electronic devices, because we actually think that this will improve the Quality of Service of clients now, when it (onboard wireless entertaining system) there is on our aircraft”, said press-secretary.
Qantas stated that it will adhere to those acting on the given moment it guided.
“Our current policy lies in the fact that the electronic devices cannot be used during the takeoff and landing, and soon we do not plan it to change”, she stated.
The decision fau rockets (v-1, v-2) applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless we are always interested in the regulating changes, which could bring benefit to passengers, and we will undoubtedly attentively study the solution of fau rockets (v-1, v-2) and reasons, which caused it.
For the ferrymen of the USA the influence of decision will vary from one airline to the next and will depend on the age of their aircraft pool.
Ferrymen had to prove that their aircraft possess stability to the radio interference from the mobile devices, and to also reexamine benefits, training materials, standards on the transport hand luggage and instruction for the passengers.
“After airline will verify and will confirm the noise immunity of its fleet, it can permit passengers to use the portable, light electronic devices, such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height”, stated fau rockets (v-1, v-2).
In the rare cases of poor visibility the crew will give indications to passengers to turn off its devices during the landing.
Furthermore, according to the recommendation of group, heavier devices must be located under the seats or in upper baggage holds during the takeoff and landing.
Obama rejects his words about public health
Among the storm critics President Obama yesterday went to the backwards relative to his frequently repeated, single-valued promise, that “if you pleases your plan of medical insurance, you can preserve it”.
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people obtain information about the curtailment of the rendering of services from their providers, Republicans in the recent days criticized severely the President for the fact that it leads American society into error.
Yesterday Obama somewhat touched up his original public promise.
“The majorities of people, which have the medical insurance, which works, can preserve it”, he said in its presentation in Boston.
Concerning that it named “reanimation in the news” apropos of the curtailment of the rendering of services, Obama issued a call Americans obtaining these information to search for different versions for market.
The majorities of people will have the capability to obtain the best, comprehensive plans of medical insurance on the same price or even cheaper than it was forecast.
“You will obtain more advantageous conditions”, he said.
Administration stated, that no one must astonish, that 5% of populations, which buy insurance independently, can be forced to replace plans, because their coating does not correspond to the new standards, necessary in accordance with the law about the accessible medical aid.
“Make it possible to me to say to directly these Americans: you deserve the best”, said Sibelius in the presentation before the committee on power engineering and trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, which treats the realization of law about the accessible medical aid, said that the starting of the area of Internet-sales goes “terribly badly” since October.
“I am detuned and is angered just as everything, she said.
— I greatly want to return your confidence”.
Irritated Sibelius dropped this phrase, which grasped the switched on microphone, to the sitting behind it assistant at the yesterday's hearings in the chamber after hot debates with the member of the House of Representatives bills by Long, Republican from the state of Missouri, about that, did obligated it itself to enter the program of Obama's public health.
Long again imperatively requested Sibelius to say after more than three hours of hearings, why “the architect” of law about the accessible medical aid voluntarily did not forego the sponsored by government insurance for the acquisition of the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now it ties to millions of Americans.

The studio of Blizzard free of charge released on PC its platformer of 1994 of Blackthorne.
WoW Insider reports about this.
Accordingly its data, game became accessible in Battle.net in the division of the classical games of Blizzard.

Koulson resorted to the breaking of telephone for checking the confidential communication
The former editor of the newspaper of News of the World Indy Koulson supposedly used “the breaking of telephone, shadowing and opposition” with the attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clark, who occupied at that moment the post of the minister of internal affairs.
Accuser, royal attorney Andrew Edis reported to the judgment of Old-Bayley that in May 2005 the newspaper of News of the World obtained the uncertain news about the fact that Clark meets with his “attractive special sovetnitsey” of Khannoy Polbi.
Newspaper directed private detective Glenn Mulkeyru to force open voice mail of Polbi and it was on the watch it in house in order to take interview, but also Koulson also rang by it and left voice messages, heard court.
“Charge considers that Mr. Koulson, who is now the editor of NotW, he is not such person, whom will stand near someone's house, hoping to take someone unaware, it man, who it loves to propose history to people, in order to see, that they will say”, said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspaper of News of the World used three methods of the investigation of the histories: the breaking of telephones, shadowing and opposition.
Editor is personally mixed in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the shadowing, it is simply must.
What about the first?
Does know he about the breaking of telephones?
He indicates that no, we speak: “O, yes!”
Rumors about Clark's novel for the first time drew attention to the editorial staff of News of the World, when to the source, sexually interested in Mrs. Polbi, they said: “Do not spend time, it with Charles”.
Cassette with the voice messages, obtained from its telephone at least three times, was withdrawn from the house of Mulkeyra in August 2006.
Inspectors also found the records on the computer of private detective, in which Miss Polbi and its sister figured as “projects”.
For the duration of the period, when it was found under the shadowing, grandmother and grandfather of Mrs. Polbi obtained anonymous calls with the requests to grant information about it, said Mr. Edis.
At this time former chief reporter Neville Terlbek and former reporter James Uezerap controlled shadowing after the movements of Mrs. Polbi.
After leaving by it voice message on June 18, 2005, Koulson it said: “I have the history, which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I greatly wanted to discuss with Charles”.
Mr. Edis said that the participation of Koulsona in this history occurred on the same scenario as with other influential people, for example with the former minister of internal affairs David Blankett.
Jurors heard on Thursday, that Koulson entered the confrontation with Mr. Blankettom apropos of the novel with the married woman while it itself was encountered with the sootvetchitsey Rebecca Brooks, who was at that moment married.
Koulson and Brooks deny the entry into the agreement with other people for the purpose of the breaking of telephones in the period from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyr, Terlbek and Uezerap acknowledged in the breaking of telephones.
In the bases of MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) there is no group “fraternal circle”, to which in the USA they added Lepsa
In the databases of the Russian power figures of the group “fraternal circle”, to which Washington added singer Grigori Lepsa, it is not registered.
As they noted “to Interfax” in the law-enforcement agencies RF, after in media outlets appeared communications about the introduction by the Board of Exchequer of the USA Grigori Leps in check list on the suspicion of membership in Eurasian criminal syndicate “fraternal circle”, all databases were checked, but such group it was not discovered.
The propagation of this information contributes to the maintenance of myth about the so-called “Russian Mafia”, who allegedly acts abroad, they count in the primary structures.
“Even in the name itself - 'fraternal circle', is a certain element of mysteriousness, is contained hint to the secret gunstock.
“All this is very similar to the PR-action”, said the collocutor of agency.
The Board of Exchequer of the USA on October 31 declared about the recording onto its check list on the suspicion of membership in the Eurasian criminal syndicate “fraternal circle” of Arthur Badalyan, Grigori Lepsveridzes, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov of Rybalskogo and Igor Shlykova.
The persons, carried in this list, they suspect of the connections with the certain by Vladislav Leont'yev and Gafurom by Rahimov, which are considered as the influential members of criminal groups and they are located in the sanction lists of the USA since February 2012.
In the opinion of the U.S. authorities, Grigori Leps " serves as messenger for the delivery of Vladislav Leont'yev's money on behalf”.
In the producer center of Grigori Leps they refused to comment on the charges of the USA in the address of singer, after naming their “delirium”.
In 2011 the President of the USA Barack Obama carried syndicate “fraternal circle” to the number “essential transnational organized criminal groups” and directed Minfin (Ministry of Finance) “to undermine and to prohibit their global criminal operations”.
The recording of man onto the black lists of American Minfin (Ministry of Finance) entails the blocking of its assets in the USA and prohibition to the business connections with it of those, who live in the states.
Scientists shed light to that, as the motions of tail dogs were connected with her mood.
Earlier studies showed that the contented dogs wag by tail to the right side (from the point of view of dog), while the worried dogs wave by tail predominantly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other representatives of the family of hound can note these thin differences in the wobble by tail and react on them.
Professor Dzhordzhio Vallortigara, neyrobiolog from the Trentskogo university, he says: “It is well known that in people the left and right sides of the brain differently participate in shaping of the stimulators, that cause positive or negative emotions”.
Here we attempted to look to this and in other forms.
It added that just as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain controls the left side of body and on the contrary, two hemispheres play different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs they react to many-sided povilivaniya of the tails of other dogs, researchers controlled animals, when they looked films about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of palpitation of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably, already soon we will understand, why their tails sometimes are sent for one side, and sometimes — into another
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs of video with the dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouette in order to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate by the motion of tail and direct tail more to the left or to the right”.
When animals saw that in other respects nothing the expressing dog moved tail to the right (from the point of view wagging dog of the wagging by tail), they remained completely slack.
But when they noted that the tail was inclined predominantly to the left (again from the point of view wagging dog) of the wagging tail, their palpitation was repeated and they appeared worried.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that the dogs intentionally associated with each other with the aid of these motions.
In reality it considers that the dogs learned from their experience, about what motions by it one should worry, and about what are not.
It notes: “If occur several meetings with other dogs and frequently the wobble of their tail to one side is connected with the friendlier behavior, and right side gives less friendly behavior, then dog reacts on the basis of this experience”.
Researchers say that these results can give more a fundamental understanding of the emotions of their animal to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
Expert in the region of the behavior of dogs to John Bredsho, the invited scientific worker in the veterinary school of Bristol university, said that this was the not first study for checking that, do have a value for the dogs left and right sides.
In the past year the group of scientists from Lincoln's university revealed that the dogs turn heads to the left, if they look at the aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at the contented dog.
But in another scientific work of the university of Victorias in Canada it reported: “Dogs more frequently approached the dog-robot, when the wobble of its tail was sent to the left, but not to the right, instead of become worried, opposite behavior with respect to an Italian study”.
He said that the differences could be because the dogs in different studies did not completely receive animals in the films or dog-robots as the dogs.
Could be useful a study of that how dogs they react to the present dogs, it explained.
“While on different mammals there exists sufficiently evidence of the fact that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, for many component still one must refine, and dog not exception”, he said.
However, taking into account that ease, with which can be registered their behavior, probably, already soon we will understand, why their tails sometimes are sent for one side, and sometimes — into another.
It is ready ehlite of Europe news business with England?
The campaign of Business for Britain was neglected with the obligation to in April gather the representatives of business and to determine, what changes the creators of welfare and jobs for Great Britain want to see in the relations with the European Union.
For this purpose we ordered the largest and most complete interrogation of British business-leaders, after requesting them to express its thoughts about Great Britain, business and the European Union.
The company of YouGov interrogated more than 1000 business-leaders, who present the wide shear of business in Great Britain according to the sizes, to sectors and to regions.
The conclusions of interrogation will prove to be unexpected contingency for many.
We explained that the overwhelming majority of enterprises at present searches for the opportunities of export beyond the limits of Europe, paying special attention to the countries, which conduct modernization even they grow, while the countries the European Union are found in the stagnation.
They want so that the government would return priority to new commercial relations with such countries as China, India and Brazil, but it did not spend time on the long and difficult process of reforming the intricate institutes the European Union.
When they asked them about their views on specific political questions, from the antitrust regulation to the laws about production, the majority of business-leaders considered that the monitoring of these key spheres of scope must be returned to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market was present, the representatives of business declaring, that the expenses from the regulation from Brussels now hang somewhere else advantages from the presence in the commercial zone of Europe, agreed with this even 40 percent of important enterprises, traditionally most proevropeyski of those disposed of all companies.
The last and most exponential — our interrogation of the leaders of business revealed, which explicit majority wants so that Great Britain would carry out course on a treaty modification and to the relations with the European Union, based on the trade, but not on the policy.
This result, which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and largest business-groups, shows that the business insists on “significant change”, which will return authorities back to Great Britain.
Rates are high — reaching changes in the agreement and of the more advantageous conditions for Great Britain will ensure 16-percent shift in the affirmative vote that in order to remain in the European Union.
The Prime Minister have to be of any doubts: this interrogation shows that the British business supports its plan of the revision of the conditions of membership of Great Britain in the European Union.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to the significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the side of Great Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and become all more necessary in proportion to that how the Euro-zone it enters to the way of closer economic and financial association.
Priority must return to jobs and economic growth in Great Britain, and, as show the results of our interrogation, for the business this indicates the intensive concentration of attention in the trade and fundamental changes in the normative activity of Brussels.
Politician in Turkey it declared hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In the middle of October the authorities began the building of separating wall in the district of the city of Nusaybin on the southeast of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of prokurdskoy party PMD appeared sharply against the building.
The mayor of the located on the border with Syria Turkish city of Nusaybin Ayshe Gekkhan declared hunger strike, protesting against the building of separating wall on the Turkish-Syrian boundary, they reported Russian International News Agency in the press service of the Peace Party and democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police repeatedly drove away protest demonstrations.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Muammer Gyuler first refuted the fact of building, then he stated that the wall is built for providing of a security of frontiers.
“Mayor Nusaybina to Ayshe Gekkhan, member PMD, declared hunger strike, thus after converting their protest against the building of wall into mortal combat”, they stated in the press service of party.
The mayor of city considers that the building of wall to called insulate the Kurdish population of two countries from each other, the Kurds intersected this boundary freely during the half century.
“This is the inhuman situation, with which the Kurds never will agree”, cite Ayshe Gekkhan of the representatives of party.
According to the data of the press service, on November 7 in Nusaybine is planned conducting meeting against the building of separating wall.
This morning in the Saratskiy region the driver of automobile “Peugeot” left to oncoming traffic on 115 km of the route of Odessa-Reni, and he collided with the bus, in which were located six people.
About this reports the press service of administration GSCHS in Odessa region.
The 31-year driver of automobile “Peugeot” died as a result of the incident.
55--year passenger and 44-year-old bus driver, to which it stopped up foot, suffered.

Also the colleagues of fast medical aid inspected all remaining passengers.
Rescuers with the aid of the crane raised bus and freed bus driver, whose foot it proved to be that stopped up in the door of bus.
In Siberia it does not stand to be veganom: hot-house tomato will not replace supchik
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life to Siberia, it explained the correspondent of Russian International News Agency.
People, which completely forewent themselves the products of animal origin, must not live in Siberia.
Here by them not to transfer winter without the losses for the health, and their no hot-house tomatoes compensate, count vegana interrogated on the eve of the day Novosibirsk dietologists and doctors.
To drink oil by the liters
A strict vegetarianism, when they reject not only the meat and fish, but also the milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, doctor-dietologists are assured that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict standards in the nourishment, as a minimum, nepolezno for the health.
Complete failure of the animal products is harmful.
In the animal proteins are contained the irreplaceable amino acids, which it is very complicated to compensate by plant.
It is necessary to necessarily include in ration at least milk or eggs”, is assured dietologist the sea-scape of Bogay.
It cites as an example the fish, that contains irreplaceable fatty acid omega-3.
Richest in it vegetable oil - flaxen.
“In order to consume it in quantities the necessary for the man, it is necessary by liters to drink!” - says dietologist.
Physicians are assured that to the inhabitants of Siberia the special attention for ration must be paid in winter.
In this season the vegetarianism especially is brought into question.
Under the conditions of our realia the high demands on food are imposed.
In order not to freeze, the increased caloricity is necessary.
“If man limits itself on the animal products, correspondingly, this caloricity it is shortchanged”, says specialist.
With this is agreeable doctor-dietologist Olga Poznyak.
It adds, that imported vegetables and fruits - not output.
To man it is better to feed predominantly by the products, which are grown in the region of stay or, where it was born.
The genetic code is disposed to better mastering and over-boiling these products.
And people is in winter desirable not cucumber to pogryzt, but hot supchika or still something posytnee”, explains his position doctor.
According to her, from the fact that they can eat vegany, are properly useful different cereals, groats, bean, local vegetables, apples, which are remained into the winter, frozen berries.
But this, it is unambiguous, it is insufficient for the valuable nourishment.
In the opinion of doctor-gastroenterologist Claudii Arifulinoy, in Siberians in the organisms the level of vitamins is sufficient only from the middle of August on the middle of September.
Complete passage to the vegetarianism under our rigid natural conditions, when temperature can in the twenty-four hours change to 30 degrees and in May snow lies, it is inadvisable.
To organism for the life is necessary energy, and this, first of all, fat”, establishes physician.
Doctors note that veganstvo is especially detrimental for the children and pregnant females.
Children grow, building material is necessary to them, including in the form of the amino acids.
But adhering to vegetarianism, we them give defective.
Pregnant females also need the increased content of protein, vitamins and microcells in the menu.
Their “Veganki they receive less”, is assured Bogay.
Arifulina indicates that the adult person is free to select everything, anything, “to play into those toys, which he wants”.
It has the already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
But children nevertheless must feed valuably.
If parents deprive of some its microcells or of amino acids, selecting for it that the fact that it will be, this is simple disturbance of the rights of child.
“A deficiency in various substances for the development of the brain, sight, bones you will tomorrow no longer restore”, she says.
All interrogated specialist-physicians are agreed in the opinion about the low quality of the reared by winter in the hot-houses and imported vegetables and fruits.
The fact that to us they bring that grown in the hot-houses, contains a smaller quantity necessary microcells of necessary for us, than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of products is not that”, says Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that the imported and hot-house vegetables and fruits are distant from the ideal standards.
Now and then the desire of producers to gather larger harvest does damage to quality.
“Apples do not become brown in the shear, cucumbers rapidly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and nearomatnye”, gives examples physician, adding, that they, are most likely, stuffed by a superfluous quantity of fertilizers.
And become the suppliers not of vitamins, but cellulose.
With this it is not agreeable with the zavlaboratoriey of the Siberian physicotechnical institute of agrarian problems, the candidate of selkhoz of sciences Vera Petruk.
She indicates that with the correct approach and observance of all standards and requirements in the hot-houses the cultivation of valuable vegetables is possible.
If they try to expel a little more from the square meter, then, of course, and to pour on they will begin more frequently, and to over-feed plants by the mineral fertilizers.
As the example, when too many nitrogenous fertilizers, tomatoes rapidly they grow, they large, but watery and nesladkie”, explain it, adding, that a question of quality, in the first place, depends conscience on producer.
Russia out of the fight for the pollution of cities by the automobiles
The attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in the majority of the megapolises of peace beginning from the second-half of the 20th Century.
As a rule, the discussion dealt either about their reconstruction and expansion of mains or with the attempts to reduce demand for the automobile trips, quantity of automobiles and time of their usage.
Is widely known an example of Singapore, where the rigid apportion of increase in the number of particular automobiles is introduced, and right their acquisition it is bought at the auctions.
Its price can two or three times exceed the price of automobile itself.
European cities, including London, introduced pay for the entrance into the city center.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, introduce the so-called green zones, where is permitted entrance to only automobiles with specific ekoklassom, which uses also of fuel- high quality (including biofuel or electric cars).
The protection agency of the environment of Beijing, for example, affirmed in 2012 “five-year plan of pure air” with total cost approximately 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As described “"” the director of division on the control of the transport pollution of municipal bureau of environmental protection of Beijing whether Kunsheng, the central objective of the five-year plan - decrease in the leading polluters of air to 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the quantity of particular automobiles to the level of not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), or an increase is not more than by 5% of use of a fuel taking into account one vehicle.
According to the data of agency, now the motor transport in Beijing is critical for 22.5% of general air pollution.
In the number of the control gauges of program - limitation of the use of truck transport, and also the introduction of super taxes for the auto-owners.
Among other things, the urban measures “green five-year plan” include the accelerated in comparison with the remaining country passage for evrostandarty of fuel, introduction of the local system of ekostandartov and marking of automobiles and fuel, limitation to the entrance of automobiles into the center section of the city, prohibition in the use of the obsolete vehicles (furthermore, the creation of the encouraging financial programs of the replacement of old automobiles to the hybrid or electric cars), development of electric transport (including public and official), development of public transport (including high-speed).
The number of automobile innovations of Beijing also includes prohibition for all particular automobiles for the motion in the limits of the fifth transport ring (in all in the capital of C.P.R. [Peoples' Republic of China] their six) one day in the week (corresponding information it is contained in the indentification tag of vehicle), and also the delivery of registration signs for the automobiles on the basis of lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of the action of lottery, the total number of permissions for the registration of private cars in Beijing it composed only third from a quantity of 2010).
According to the acting state program “protection of environment to 2012-2020”, quantity of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 them it was 138).
According to the data of Minprirody, in 2011 to “mobile sources” it was 41% of all ejections of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, the ejections from the automobiles ten times exceed industrial, while in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In RF thus far only they begin to think about the opportunities of the limiting regulation of automobiles on the streets of cities.
The director of the institute of the economy of transport and transport policy of HSE [Higher School of Economics] Mikhail Blinkin considers that the administrative and fiscal measures, directed toward the suppression of demand for the automobile trips, the matter deliberately unpopular, they can be accepted by society only under the conditions of their sheerest universality.
In the case of Moscow appears the unique problem, connected with the structure of its motor park, where are present two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulating to actions - official and personal automobiles, and also the automobiles “privileged” users, whose total number comprises not less than 200,000 (of about 5% of the total number of motor park of Moscow).
Recently urbanists from the center WHAT A in St. Petersburg prepared the study, where the balance of the urban territories between the housing building, area of road surface and quantity of motor transport is analyzed.
Basic conclusions of the researchers: city center is provided for with roads two times of less than required, but the majorities of motorists, which live in the center, do not use automobiles each day, leaving them for a prolonged time on parkings or simply on the streets.
As a result it is proposed to build not parkings, but the depository of automobiles, not to enlarge, but to reduce roadway (so that the streets would be begun by friendlier for the pedestrians), or to limit use and arrangement of the personal transport in the range of the territory of the guarding zone of historical center (by overall territory approximately 3212 hectares, which covers a number of central city districts).
To an increase in the cost of fuel the tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the tax by the extraction of minerals (NDPI) to oil simultaneously with reduction in the export duties and increase in the excises, will lead.
In the opinion of the experts, these measures can bring into the budget the additional of 619.3 billion rub

In it hand was first only broken, but the emergent infection was extended to the brain and caused hematoma, which reminded one of itself to the end of the life.
“In the cameroons there were no neurosurgeons, said Georges Bvelle.
If we had money, we would export it from the cameroons.
Instead of this Bvelle it for years accompanied its father in the overfilled clinics and hospitals, obtaining any treatment, which they could obtain.
“This is not easy, said Bvelle.
— You can go out in 5 mornings, come running into the hospital in order to be the first, but you no longer first.
there are very many patients.
Some can die because them is necessary to wait.
Situation strongly did not change from those times, as father Bvelle passed away in 2002.
According to the data of the World Health Organization, in the cameroons only one doctor to 5000 people.
For the comparison, relationship in the United States — one doctor to 413 people.
And even if kameruntsy could turn to the doctor, many of them this would be not on the pocket.
Two of five people in this country live after the poverty line, and almost three fourths of expenditures for public health in it are quotients.
“Their only problem is poverty, said Bvelle.
— And because of the poverty they cannot delight in by their life”.
Seeing the sufferings of its father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle was filled the determination something with this to make.
In the past year doctor Georges Bvelle and its command of volunteers conducted 700 free operations.
It itself became doctor and works as vascular surgeon in the central hospital Yaunde.
It also established the nonprofit organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes the trips to the rural locality along the output for the assignment to free medical aid.
Since 2008 it and its group of volunteers rendered assistance by almost 32 000 people.
Almost each Friday it and up to 30 people are filled into the vans, tie to the roofs medical equipment and will go through the broken ground in order to visit the being needed aid villages.
Success does not always them accompany.
It was repeatedly them necessary to push machines across the rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, them they meet as the real heroes: these are holiday with the songs and dances and the best accomodations, such as local residents only can propose.
Free medical service in these villages is actually occasion for the holiday, and Bvelle with its wide smile and limitless energy more than is happy to be joined to the merriment.
Upon the following morning the brigade begins to assume hundreds of patients.
“We assume 500 people in each trip”, said Bvelle.
They come from the entire neighbourhood in a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics of leave day allows diverse medical services.
Many people obtain treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, which are transmitted through sex.
Others can obtain crutches, endowed glasses or free evidence about the generation — documents, necessary for the school, which many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings the brigade carries out simple operations under the local anesthesia.
Operations, as a rule, are conducted in the building of school, municipality or in the house; after procedure the patients arise and go into the postoperative zone in order to free place for the following person.
Using a generator for illuminating the operating and sanitary working of equipment, to Bvelle its volunteers work until the early morning of Sunday.
This is difficult rate, but village musicians usually help to support the purposefulness of brigade.
“They entire night beat the drums so that we would keep awake and they continued to work”, said Bvelle.
On Sunday the members of brigade leave back for the city, tired, but proud by their work.
This group, which consists of the Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations last year, and they know that their aid can have enormous value for those, they help whom.
One person explained that free operation on the treatment of rupture the obtained by him will allow it again to work.
“This will change future for me and my family”, said man.
In addition to these clinical methods into the output and work in the hospital by surgeon Bvelle also works by nights in the particular medical clinics all around to Yaunde.
Specifically, this second work, according to him, ensures with 60% of financing its nonprofit organization; remaining means are covered due to the particular donations.
“I even do not know, when he sleeps”, said To keti O'Melli, the medical student of the second course of the Drekselskogo university in Philadelphia, volunteer in the group Bvelle.
It always either in the hospital or attempts to earn money for the organization so that it would be possible to continue these campaigns.
_for future doctor and nurse, such as about ' Melli, newcomer from USA and Europe, in order to join to Bvelle in realization its task, this opportunity practice, which they never not obtain at home.
“We obtained the opportunity to assist on the operations, where we helped to move away the spots of the blood or to hold tools for doctor Bvelle”, she spoke about ' Melli.
Being student-sophomore, you never obtained this opportunity in America.
Student-volunteers usually themselves pay their passage into the cameroons, frequently arriving with the endowed drugs.
But on the arrival in Yaunde their nourishment, transport and instruction pays Bvelle.
“He is hero, undoubtedly”, she spoke about ' Melli.
It returns its life of this organization, and its desire to help people of the cameroons infinitely.
For to Bvelle almost constant overloading by work is not heavy testing.
To help to live happy life others, to carry out the data to its father promise — this that which brings great happiness to it.
“I am so happy, when I make this work, said Bvelle.
— And I think about my father.
I hope, it sees that I make.
I make this so that the people would laugh in order to decrease their pain.
Visit to the site of ASCOVIME even you will look how you can help.
After “Russian Mafia” in the USA finally was fastened new name - “fraternal circle”
On this week the black list “Russian Mafia” in America was supplemented by new names and four companies.
The Board of Exchequer of the USA introduced into “fraternal circle” three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and Israeli.
One of the Russians proved to be well-known singer Grigori Leps, whom the USA suspects of the transportation of money for the members of group.
In all in the black list of the USA of 22 people, participating to “fraternal circle”, and six affiliated with it organizations.
Nevertheless many experts express doubts about the fact that this organization actually exists.
“Statement o 'by Bratsk circle' more greatly resembles the attempt to combine the separate criminal groups”, previously stated expert on the organized criminality and university professor of New York Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, “fraternal circle” reflects the popular perception “Russian Mafia”.
“I would meet no one in the Russian law-enforcement agencies or still somewhere, who would confirm existence of this criminal organization”, cites Mr. To galeotti the American Center for a study of corruption and organized criminality.
With Mr. To galeotti it is agreeable and the university professor George Mason Lees with Shelli.
“If they act together, then this greater it is similar to the criminal network, but not organization”, gives its words the Center for a study of corruption and organized criminality.
In the middle of last year of Mark Galeotti assumed that “fraternal circle” is united in the larger measure of those approximated of Russian thief in Aslan Usoyan's law, known as grandfather Khasan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
Thus, the activity Lashi of Shushanashvili and Zacharias Kalashov, that supplemented list in 2012, it was tightly connected with the grandfather with Khasan, and one additional participant in the list, Temuri Mirzoev, it was for grandfather to Khasan nephew.
Nevertheless Mr. To galeotti notes that some personalities do not refer to Usoyanu.
In his opinion, all them united faster overall financial and criminal interests, for example the delivery of narcotics from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile the scandal around the start in “fraternal circle” of Grigori Leps - the dear singer of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin - drew the attention of the Kremlin.
It is natural, we calculate that we will obtain from our American colleague-partners more detailed information, was in connection with which accepted this solution, why into such lists they introduced it, said press-secretary the Heads of State Dmitriy Peskov.
In any event it (Leps) is citizen RF.
Just as the interests of all citizens RF, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said that it will use chance to the return as the Prime Minister of Great Britain, but it recognizes that the return is highly improbable.
On the previous night in the interview, dedicated to the fifth anniversary of withdrawal from his post, 59--year politician presented his views on different aspects of domestic policy.
From the moment of resignation in June 2007, after ten years at the post of leader, Blair to a considerable degree avoided the consideration of British policy, limiting the majority of its commentaries by foreign affairs and by its role of ambassador in the four of Middle Eastern peacemakers.
Answering a question, it would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair, according to the communication to London Evening Standard, he said: “Yes, of course, but hardly this will happen, so that…”
The head coach “of Milan” Allegri's Massimiliano expressed regret apropos of in a draw result in the match of the 10th stage of the championship of Italy s “Latsio”.
Specialist also noted that the failures at the start were caused by a series of the injuries of the chief players.
To me it is very it's a pity, which we did not succeed in defeating, gives Tmw Allegri's word.
Command played high-quality match, after creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In first time we nothing allowed “Latsio”.
The secondly Romans added, but as a whole I cannot say that we lost concentration.
It was necessary to conquer.
In the past season we accomplished the task of entry into the League of Champions.
Now we lag behind the graph, but this is caused by an entire series of the injuries of key football players.
Ramies and Khonda?
These are very good players, with the nature.
However, our composition is now good.
Look at Kaka, which conducted meeting on the high level.
The British police entrusts information about the delivery to Assange
The British police today entrusted information about the delivery of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who was covered in the embassy of Ecuador in London and requested refuge.
In Scotland Yard they stated that they entrusted to 40-year Australian “official requirement to be returned” with the requirement to appear into the police station, after adding that in the case of the nonfulfillment of this requirement it will further be subject to arrest.
To Assange threatens extradition into Sweden on the charges in the sexual crimes after it exhausted its opportunities in accordance with the British law, when the Supreme Court deflected its appeal to the extradition earlier in this month.
Fearing, that Stockholm will transmit its USA, on June 19 it was covered in the embassy of Ecuador in London, after requesting in this South American country of political refuge.
Scotland Yard “entrusted to 40-year man the official requirement to be returned, which forces it to arrive in the police station during the day and in time on our selection”, as press-secretary reported.
It as before disrupts release conditions under the guarantee.
Embassy refused to comment on the presentation of the information of the police.
Assange fears, that he will be extradited from Sweden to the USA for the presentation to it possible charges of espionage after publication more than 250 000 American diplomatic dispatches on the speaking against secrecy Web site of WikiLeaks.
Now Roman Senchin is situated in Paris at the presentation of his novel “Eltyshevy”, translated into French.
Let us recall, precisely, its this novel he became the finalist of four rewards: “Clear clearing”, “Russian Buker”, “national best-seller” and “large book”.
But in the past year writer for this book was honored the reward of the government of the Russian Federation in the region of culture.
Roman Senchin - undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prosaists.
The practically each publication of its rigid, constructed on the contemporary vital material stories and narratives causes heated debates among the critics of the most different directions.
It is possible to assert that the assembled together articles about prose and journalism of Senchina, review of its books and periodical publications create the curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990's years prior to the beginning 2010-X.
In the discussions about the works “of one of the most questionable contemporary writers” according to the criticism of Sergey Chuprinin, speech for the most part are conducted about the fact that its participants understand under the word “literature”, by what see present and future not only our literatures, but also lives.
Unfortunately, the size of the book did not make it possible to include the majority of articles and reviews of the regional media outlets and blogosphere in it.
Analytical and review papers are given, as a rule, in the reduction in the divisions “paragraphs…”
Snoudena can interrogate in Russia
The ex-colleague of American intelligence agencies Edward Snouden, most likely, will not leave beyond the limits of Russia for the dacha of indications in the matters about proslushke of the telephone negotiations of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.
As it stated “to Interfax” on Friday source, familiar with the situation, American can answer questions of the representatives of the Attorney General's Office of Germany in writing or confrontation in Russia.
Edward Snouden's departure beyond the limits of Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case it will lose status of refugee and can be given out to Washington by the countries - the allies of the USA”, said the collocutor of agency.
“At the same time, in principle, the Attorney General's Office of the FRG could direct in RF of its representatives or transmit written questions to Snoudenu”, added source, after adding that this question must be studied at the intergovermental level.
The previously deputy of German Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele reported that Edward Snouden was ready to give indications on business about proslushke by the American intelligence agencies of the negotiations of the chancellor of Germany.
Snouden is ready to give indications to German law-enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany.
The ex-colleague of the CIA gave to understand that it knows very much.
In spite of the fact that ANB of the USA blocked all its movements, Snouden was ready to arrive into Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly determine all conditions of its arrival”, reported Shtrebele to the television channel of Euronews.
Attorney Snoudena Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement of the source “of Interfax”, stated that its client can collaborate with the German inspectors, but when and as - it will solve itself.
The citizen of the USA Edward Snouden, who worked on the agency of the national security (ANB) of the USA and CIA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013; after which he promulgated information about the secret operations of the intelligence agencies of the USA on the shadowing in the Internet.
Snouden flew through Moscow by transit, but could not leave airport because its passport annulled the authorities of the USA, externally produced for it serious charges, and prior to the beginning of August it remained in the transit airport control zone “Sheremet'yevo Airport”.
First August Snouden obtained document about the assignment to it of temporary refuge in the territory of Russia by period for year and during the same day left “Sheremet'yevo Airport”.
Yesterday the attorney of American Anatoly Kucheren stated that its client was arranged to the work into “important Russian company”.
German media outlets last week reported on the shadowing of ANB after Angela Merkel.
According to the data of journalists, the telephone negotiations of chancellor the Americans began to hear still in 2002.
Tracking station allegedly was located in the embassy of the USA in Berlin.
The authorities of Germany after the publication of these information stated that the shadowing for Merkel disrupts laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Land Rover is declared about the release of a racing series
Inside are located racing seats and six-point seat belts, and also the Intercom System.
Additionally it is possible to obtain the modernized brakes, packet of services, which ensures access to the mechanics of Bowler Works, logistic support and storage of the automobile between the measures.
To Dryu Bauler, manager is the director of the company of Bowler Motorsport, he said: “Participants in rally, who are rotated into Bowler, were changed”.
Some of them not experienced racers, but people, which search for unrest, adventures and access to the measures of world class.
We are glad to propose this way in the partnership from Land Rover and MSA and consider that this size proposes the new way to try different disciplines of rally in Great Britain and abroad, and to also prepare participants for severe conditions and realia of rally-raid.
We with the great pleasure developed the automobile of Defender Challenge — this there will be actually captivating championship.
Furthermore, Defender Challenge provides for one day in February for the training and tests, and also the opportunity to participate in the measures in the desert in North Africa and in the Near East.
Children must study myths and legends as “the model of a way of life”, the author speaks.
Legends about Thor could show that “brute force cannot defeat thinned craftiness”, but legends about king Arthur show, as it is important to have a dream.
Indicating that many myths will prove to be “too wild, too scandalous and in certain cases by too obscene for the teaching in the schools”, Krossli-Holland speaks in favor of “thorough selection” suitable texts of the suitable with respect to the age.
“I consider, this is miraculous that in America the myths and folklore are already the part of the formation”, he said.
I spoke in favor of their introduction into the training program of twenty years.
It added that “excessive moralizatorstvo” of the authors and instructors " repulses interest” in children, and basic ideas “subs-whetherpeaceane” into the captivating histories.
Krossli-Holland, whom translated “Beowulf” from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote “the collection of Norwegian myths” for the publishing house of Penguin and “British folk tales”, he said: “In you, of course, there can be intentions, but to you it is better to hold them with themselves”.
Possibly, by the large difference between the adult author, who records for the adult, and the need for perceiving some hope is the adult author, who records for the children.
Not that so that everything must be simplified or lead to the happy tail piece, but it is necessary that there would be the innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sub-whetherpeaceANO (Autonomous Nonprofit Organization); it is opened through the history, but it is not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, but not to describe.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of brittle economic growth in Russia - consumption.
These are, first of all, the crisis of nonpayments on the unprovided consumer credits and the mass reductions of workers.
Our main preoccupation now - not that the increase was slowed down, but is faster, the structure of this increase.
Recently it is completely caused by the consumption, which almost not sbavlyaet turnovers”, stated the Chief Economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Klemens Grafe, presenting the yesterday quarterly report of investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now a nominal increase in the wages in Russia - of about 10%.
With the inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand approximately at the current level, they expect in Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies falls, therefore, most likely, they will study the optimization of expenditures for personnel.
Today we see a considerable increase in the fraction of wages in the GDP [Gross Domestic Product]: if wages grow by 10%, then the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] - only to 2%, explained Mr. to graph.
Companies encountered the reduction of profitability.
If it does not grow, this can lead to the releases and increase in the unemployment.
Wages cannot not to raise Russian business, comments on the Chief Economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near the historical minimums, competition for the workers is high.
In order to entice colleagues from the side or to hold the current, for employers it is necessary to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by very rapid growth in potrebkreditovaniya.
To graph, because of the extremely high rates on the consumer loans of multiplicative effect on the economy of the country this form crediting does not render in the opinion of Mr.
“Benefits for the economy from an increase in potrebkreditovaniya we none saw, money not disperse on the economy, but they return to the same banks in the form of the percent payments”, said economist.
But problem in other - in Goldman Sachs they expect an increase in the delay on the unprovided credits.
Them take in essence well-off people, to which something to grant in the guarantee.
Percentages on such loans are high.
As consequence, them more frequently they do not return”, noted Mr. to graph.
Therefore the second threat to an increase in the economy in Russia - possible crisis of nonpayments on the unprovided credits.
The director of the bank institute of HSE [Higher School of Economics] Vasiliy Solodkov even now sees the signs of the ripening bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, without having a access to the cheap resources, what exists in State Banks, were forced to draw means populations under the high percentages.
As the answer the State Banks left to the path of war and they began to decrease credit rates, continues economist.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same percentages, otherwise they will have negative percent marzha.
If State Banks do not forego the dumping, to Russia threatens valuable bank crisis, assumes Vasiliy Solodkov.
Economist considers the deprivation of the licenses of a number of banks in the recent weeks the forerunner of mass crash.
“State Banks themselves this situation will not manage: the system of the insurance of contributions was not originally calculated for the system crisis”, prevents the head of institute.
But an increase in the consumption will be slowed down also without the crisis of nonpayments, they assume in the investment bank, because of the failure of the indexing of the wages of civil servants and servicemen, placed in the current version of budget estimate.
Partially impact on the consumption will be softened zamorozkoy of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, by reduction in the inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (but there are no prerequisites for this thus far - see information), an increase in the consumption nevertheless will be slowed down, they are assured in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not thus far see prerequisites for the realization of pessimistic scenarios.
“Main risk - this as before drop in the price of oil”, he says.
According to its estimation, the economy of Russia will begin to be reduced with the cost of oil of below 90 dollars of /barr.
In Goldman Sachs they also noted that TsB thus far cannot decrease the interest rates in the economy.
The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation was reduced, and banks began to raise rates.
This can mean that they did not believe TsB, that declared passage to targetirovaniyu of inflation”, said Klemens Grafe.
The percent policy of central bank does not influence market rates, it influences only the rates of interbank crediting.
“For TsB this is the crash of all hopes”, was estimated Klemens Grafe.
The money, obtained at the auctions TsB, banks use not for the crediting of the economy, but for control of their liquidity
As soon as rate is reduced, exchange rate immediately changes, this means that the means attempt to leave on the speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later TsB will understand that this strategy does not work”, said Mr. to graph and he remembered that to release the ruble into “free floating” state plans toward the end of 2015.
But it is necessary either to make this earlier or to raise key rate TsB (5.5%), it counts.
According to its estimation, the exchange value of ruble now is artificially overstated to 10%.
To ruble only one road - to weaken, conclusion expert.
But if TsB drops in the financiers the shadow of doubt about the fact that the liquidation of currency corridor - this not part of the policy on weakening of ruble, this can bring ruble down much stronger.
Snouden agreed to give indications about Merkel's proslushke
The deputy of Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele met to Moscow with Edward Snouden.
In the course of conversation was discussed a question it can Snouden be interrogated as the witness by the Attorney General's Office of the FRG on business about possible proslushke of the telephone of the chancellor of Germany by spetssltsuzhbami of the USA.
Snouden expressed readiness to give the necessary indications.
Meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
It clearly gave to understand, said Hans-Christian Shtrebele, which knows very much.
And in spite of the fact that the agency of national security directed by whale by Alexander blocked all his movements, Snouden was ready to arrive into Germany.
However, it is first necessary to clearly determine all conditions of its arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators begin to take measures in response to the scandal around the espionage programs of the USA.
Senate committee on reconnaissance yesterday approved the bill, which leads additional constraints to the activity of the American department of electronic reconnaissance.
Fau rockets (v-1, v-2): “Air passengers now can use gadgets on the aircraft (but not to ring from the cell phone)”
Air passengers can use their electronic devices during entire flight in order to read, to work, to play into the games, to look films and to listen to music, but not to say on the cell phones, according to the long-awaited new leading principles, published on Thursday by federal aviation control.
But passengers must not expect that the changes will occur immediately.
As rapidly this change realizes, it will vary depending on airline, the administrator of fau rockets (v-1, v-2) Michael Huerta at the press conference said.
For airlines it is necessary to show fau rockets (v-1, v-2), as their aircraft answer the new leading principles and that they renew their teaching aids for the flight-crew members and rule on piling of devices in order to correspond to the new leading principles.
Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) stated that it already obtained plans from some airlines for the expansion of the use of portable electronic devices in the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines, which already presented plans.
“Depending on the state of plan we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon”, stated fau rockets (v-1, v-2).
At present passengers are obligated to disconnect their Smartphones, tablets and other devices, as soon as door of aircraft it is shut.
They must not restart them, until aircraft reaches the height of 10 000 feet and captain gives “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again, when aircraft is descended for the landing, and not to include them, until aircraft proves to be on the earth.
In accordance with the new leading principles, the airlines, whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic jamming, can permit passengers to use these devices during the takeoff, landings and taxiings, stated fau rockets (v-1, v-2).
The majorities of the new airliners and other aircraft, modified in such a way that the passengers could use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, as it is expected, they answer these criteria.
Laura Gleyding, the President of the association of professional flight attendents, greeted these changes.
“After new policy will be satisfactorily realized (but we intend to work in the close contact with the ferryman in order to attain this), this it will be sure version”, stated Gleyding.
We are frank tiredness to feel ourselves “by people on duty on the school”, when the matter reaches this question.
But connection to the Internet for surfing, exchange of electronic letters, by text messages or the load of the data will be nevertheless forbidden at the height less than 10 000 feet, reported agency.
To passengers it will be proposed to switch its Smartphones, tablets and other devices into the regime of aircraft.
Thus, as before no “words with the friends” — intellectual Internet-game, into which actor Alek Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the sensational case occurred: actor was taken from the aircraft of the airline of American Airlines for the failure turn off device when aircraft was found at the output for the landing.
But heavier devices, such as laptop computers, as before will have to plot in the luggage compartment, since they can traumatize someone, if they will fly throughout entire salon.
Bells from the cell phone in flight also will be as before forbidden.
Regulating authorities on the phone calls belong to federal commission for connection, but not fau rockets (v-1, v-2).
Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) can remove prohibition to some electronic devices during the takeoff and landings
In the past month Mark Rozenker from the National Council for safety of transport, national expert on the safety of the transportation of CBS News, stated that the cell phones are as before considered risk.
“Cell phones — this actually problem, not only because potentially they can create interferences for the navigational devices, but we know because of FKS that they can create interferences for the towers of cellular communication, when aircraft is found in air”, said Rozenker.
Branch advisory board, created with fau rockets (v-1, v-2) for studying this question, recommended in the past month so that the government would permit the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years increased pressure on fau rockets (v-1, v-2) for the purpose of weakening limitations to their use.
The criticisms, such as Democratic senator from the state of Missouri Clair Makkaskil, assert that for the prohibitions there are no important reasons, connected with the safety.
The observance of limitations also becomes ever the more complicated to ensure, since the application of devices became general.
Some studies show that to third of passengers they forget or ignore indications to turn off their devices.
Fau rockets (v-1, v-2) began to limit use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to the communications about the interferences for the navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to imply Fm-radio receivers — high-tech gadgets of that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on the electrical systems, than the previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and they are asserted by fau rockets (v-1, v-2) as resistant to electronic jamming.
Airlines propose to passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the cruising altitude already for several years.
The aircraft, modified for the Wi-Fi-systems, are also more resistant to the interferences.
The overwhelming majority of liners is adapted for the wider use of electronic devices according to the new leading principles, it said Huertas.
Today's electronic devices usually emit the radio signals much of lower power than the previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading of e-books, for example, emit only minimum signals with turning of pages.
But signals become more powerfully, when they load devices or send the data.
Among those, who sought the softening of limitations to the use by passengers of electronic devices, there was company Amazon.com.
In 2011 the representatives of company loaded entire airliner by their devices for reading of the e-books of Kindle and they flew on it in order to verify the presence of problems, but so they did not reveal them.
The members of advisory board fau rockets (v-1, v-2) expressed the mixed feelings apropos of that, does present the application of devices any risk.
Douglas Kidd from the national association of air passengers stated that the interferences from the devices consider real, even if risk is minimal.
Other members of committee said that there is only separate communications of pilots, which confirm that the fact that the devices can create interferences for the aviation systems, and majority of these communications is very old.
Nevertheless committee recommended so that fau rockets (v-1, v-2) would permit pilots to require passengers tripping devices during the instrument landings under the conditions of the restricted visibility.
The group of the representatives of tourist industry greeted these changes, calling their sober-minded step towards the passengers, who now use a set of technological devices.
“We are glad, that fau rockets (v-1, v-2) recognizes itself that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with the safety and protection”, said Roger Dawe, the Director-General of the tourist association of the USA.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt at to slander the Lithuanian President
Russia is intended to carry out information provocations against the highly placed persons of Lithuania and countries of eastern partnership - this statement to the agency of BNS they made in the department of the state security of republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the portal of DELFI.
According to communication, in particular Moscow is assembled “to specify” the President of Lithuania to Dalyu Gribauskayte and to publish the falsified documents, allegedly found in Russian Gosarkhive, which concern facts from the biography of Lithuanian leader.
According to the data of intelligence agency, the preparation for information attack conducts the department of the analysis of the public control processes of the administration of the President of Russia according to interregional and cultural relations with the foreign countries.
Structure heads Yevgeny Umerenkov, who repeatedly attended Lithuania and participated in the congress of Lithuanian people party.
Also a participant in the operation allegedly is the colleague of department V. Smirnov.
As intelligence agency asserts, Smirnov under the cover by scientific work prior to the end of 2012 regularly arrived to Lithuania and contacted with the local politicians, political scientists and representatives of media outlets.
Now to Smirnov is forbidden entrance to the territory of the country.
On the eve of the President of Lithuania Gribauskayte she stated, that knows about informatake prepared to it.
In its opinion, basic from the reasons is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the council of the European Union and “tendency of the country toward the energy independence”
Lithuanian leader earlier once it did not criticize the action of Russian authorities.
So it declared, that in the Kremlin to Lithuania they relate “insufficiently validly”.
Furthermore, Gribauskayte it charged the head RF of Vladimir Putin with the advancement for Lithuania “some requirements alone”.
Let us recall, in September Rospotrbnadzor {Russian Health Protection and Supervision] stopped the import of Lithuanian “molochki” into Russia.
It communicated that the quality of production does not correspond to sanitary-epidemiological standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania stated that if Russia does not remove prohibition, the government of the country must prepare rotation in the WTO [World Trade Organization].
New anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking of the pleasure
Scientists developed the anti-nicotine vaccine, which could deprive the process of smoking the cigarette of pleasure.
One dose of vaccine could protect mice from the nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests prior to the beginning of tests on people are necessary, on that several years will be required, but professor Ronald Kristall from the medical college of Ueyll Cornell to New York stated that the first results encourage.
“We greatly hope that such a strategy of the application of a vaccine can finally help millions of smokers, who attempted to throw, after testing all methods, commercially available today, but they revealed that their nicotine dependence is sufficiently strong so as to overcome it with the aid of these contemporary means”, said professor Cornell.
New vaccine contains the benign virus, which was developed in order to bear genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
Virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to produce the stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies trace any molecules of nicotine in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing obtaining by the smoker of nicotine impact.
In the tests the vaccinated mice, to which they subsequently gave nicotine, their normal activity continued.
But the mice, to which they did not give vaccine, “weakened”, and this is the sign of the fact that the nicotine reached their brain, say researchers.
These experiments are described in the periodical of Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines suffered failure, because they contained antibodies.
In order to preserve the high level of antibodies, pricks should have been made so frequently, that they proved to be expensive and unpractical.
But the cost of new vaccine, probably, will be considerably lower, because it converts the cells of the liver into the factories of antibodies.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it would be possible to give to children before in them will appear the desire trying to cigarette, preventing nicotine dependence.
But is more probable that it will be used by smokers in order to throw to smoke.
“They will know that if they begin to smoke again, they will not obtain from this pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them to get rid of this habit”, he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they warned that additional studies were necessary.

Frontier Airlines will collect pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines is planned to collect from the passengers to $100 for the fact that they carry hand luggage onboard their voyage.
Frontier Airlines is planned to begin to collect to $100 for hand luggage even $2 for the coffee or aeration, although their declaration on Wednesday said, that the passengers can leave to themselves entire jar.
New pay for hand luggage applies to bags in the upper baggage holds; therefore the small bags, placed under the seat, will remain free.
Frontier said that $25 will collect, if collection is paid previously, and $100, if those travelling will pay, having only proved to be at the output to the landing.
The representative of Frontier Keith o ' to Melli said that the pay into $100 must force passengers to care about the prepay.
“We do not want to collect pay for this”, she said.
Airlines began to collect pay for the first and second bag, passed to the luggage, in 2008.
Passengers, who attempt to avoid these collections, fill as much, as they will be able, into hand luggage, placed into the upper baggage holds, because of what in these sections frequently is not sufficient place.
Collections — one of the methods to force passengers to carry less onboard.
About ' to Melli it said that this new collection in reality not for the earning of money.
The fact is that the most loyal clients of Frontier declare, that to find the place in the upper baggage holds is begun increasingly more difficultly.
The passengers, who buy tickets on the site of airline, should not have paid.
This means that one passenger in the turn at the output to the voyage of Frontier can obtain the opportunity to carry bag free of charge, while the following passenger in the turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
About ' to Melli it said, that a change in the procedures on the Web site and in the counters of the registration of Frontier to called guarantee, that the passengers will know about the collection before they will reach the output to the landing.
The new collection of Frontier for hand luggage will not begin to be collected of up to years, although the date is not yet established.
Passengers frequently complain about the pay for the luggage and other collections, but their airlines adore.
They assert that working the luggage costs money, and passengers, to which is necessary this service, they must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street count the addition of luggage collections by the sign of the fact that the airlines collect sufficiently money in order to cover expenditures for flights after several years of losses.
However, majority of them did not concern collections for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for hand luggage three years ago, and one additional diskaunter of Allegiant Air more lately followed its example.
Hungarian Wizz Air is only another airline with this collection, said consultant on the airlines Jay Sorensen, who attentively tracks additional collections.
According to its estimation in the report dated December 2011, the collection for hand luggage brings to Spirit $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew by the voyage of Spirit, and to him it was interesting that it will reveal at the output to the landing, when passengers encounter the uncommon collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
“Landing process was smoothest of those that I saw for my career in the airlines”, he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and appearance of fight at the output to the landing.
Aircraft was complete, he said, “landing passed swiftly”.
Frontier also follows for Spirit with respect to pay into $2 for the coffee, tea, aeration or juice.
Frontier stated that the passengers, who obtain aeration or juice, can leave to themselves entire jar and that after adding the coffee will be allowed free of charge.
It will as before free of charge give water out.
US Airways brief time attempted to collect pay for the beverages in 2008, but it forewent this in seven months, after passengers began to complain and no other important airline followed its example.
The initiative of Frontier on the levy of pay for hand luggage, when passengers do not buy tickets directly in airline, this her last measure for the attraction of clients to its Web site.
Airlines pay the online-salesmen of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
This gave to all airlines stimulus to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly in them, but not to turn into the tourist online-agency.
However, Frontier went further all in this region.
In September it began to give two of less than the bonus miles of the frequently flying passenger to the clients, who purchased the tickets through the online tourist agency.
On Wednesday it cut off the bonus number of miles to 25 percent of the miles of trip.
Thus, the trip to 1000 miles from Frontier, acquired in online tourist agency, would make it possible to obtain 250 miles.
Furthermore, to passengers it is possible to select place previously, only if they buy tickets directly on the site of Frontier.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in its home town Denver, but its business is reduced and it becomes unprofitable.
Gain was reduced by 9 percent, and flying opportunities were reduced almost by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial sums, published on Wednesday by the parental company of Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempts to repair the finances of Frontier within the framework of sale to airline.
Putin attained impunity for his friend of Assad
But now - the news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as they became known today, Israel delivered impact on the rockets of the Russian production, which, according to the communications, were intended “to the Hezbollah”.
Today Syria satisfied important condition - to destroy by November 1 its productions of chemical weapon.
This was made within the framework of the agreement, achieved with the mediation of Russia and allowed the USA not to carry out the military operation, to which they close approached this summer.
It is in more detail about the weapon and about that which means for the Syrian President all this, our main international correspondent Richard Engel will describe.
Washington stated that Assad's regime will be punished for this.
More than 1400 innocent civilians of, including hundred children, they died in August from the poison gas.
And punishment arrived.
But not in the form of the American bombings, but in the form of the transaction, which arranged the friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will forego its chemical weapon to the middle of the following year.
And today - watershed.
The group of international experts reported that Syria put out of action the declared factories on the production of chemical weapons.
More long-term and difficult task - this destruction of the tons of chemical weapon and components to it.
As we understand, this about thousand of tons.
Earlier Washington indicated that Assad's days were considered.
I count, Assad must leave.
A question not in that, will happen this, but in that, when this happens.
It no longer is legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And it feels itself still more confident.
Its troops as before use artillery, rockets and napalm.
Its enemies are separated and it is badly armed.
Its people vynuzhdenno leaves its houses, many starve.
Certain it is necessary to feed by leaves and cats.
Many assume that Bashar Assad avoided punishment for the mass murder.
Agreement about the chemical weapon is called the success of diplomacy, they awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to inspectors, and Assad himself produced the impression of person, ready to collaboration.
Today in Washington for the ambassador of the USA to Syria it was necessary to answer complex questions.
When child perishes from the hunger, his mother hardly more easily from the fact that him they did not kill with the aid of the chemical weapon.
Assad thus far is held.
And changes weapon by the authority.
Tomich will work out 240 hours for the extremist roller in the social network
The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced 240 hours of the required work of the inhabitant of city, who placed in the social network the videotape of extremist directivity, it reported Russian International News Agency on Friday the representative of the press service of provincial court.
According to the data vessels, in March 2013 the man placed on his page in the popular social network the video recording, which was introduced into the federal list of extremist materials.
In the relation it was excited the criminal case for article Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “the actions, directed toward the excitement of hatred and enmity, and also toward humiliation of the merit of man perfected publicly”.
“Leninist district court examined this matter in the special order and recognized man as the guilty of the commission of the crime pointed out above, after appointing punishment in the form of 240 hours of required works”, said the interlocutress of agency.
It added that the man completely recognized his fault.
The parents of interseksualnykh children can select “indeterminate gender”
Germany became the first European Country, which recognized the third gender in children, originated with intermediate type external sex organs.
To the newborns no longer they will necessarily assign masculine or feminine sex.
New law does not require parents to call any gender of such children, making possible for parents to indicate gender as “not determined” or “not established” in their evidence about the generation.
The purpose of law it was to remove pressure from the parents, who can make hasty decisions about the operation on awarding of gender to newborns, and counteract discrimination of interseksualnykh people.
One interseksualnyy person, according to BBC, it said many years later: “I am not man and not woman”.
I will remain the created by doctors flap article with the bruises and scars.
Approximately one of two thousand children, who are born yearly, is neither boy nor girl.
They have intersexuality, one of approximately 60 pathologic states, which fall under the diagnosis “of the disturbance of sexual development” — collective term for the people with the atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or uncommonly developed external sex organs.
Uollis Simpson was, possibly, interseksualom.
Gender identification, until now, is insufficiently studied; however, the majority of experts in the USA indicate that, if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use the entire existing information and to appropriate it, than to wait and to track the psychological and physical development of the child before conducting of operation, if generally this occurs.
New York psychiatrist, doctor Jack Dresher, who specializes in the problems of gender identification, said that the new German law “sounds as a good idea”.
Interseksualnye children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have the threatening life disturbances, which require operational interference; however, the majority of their children does not have any”, he, said.
You can appropriate gender without the operation and then look, as personality is developed.
The science about how in child will develop any gender identity, is not too precise.
No one can answer the questions of why this occurs.
This as puzzle about why people are homosexual.
The report, sent for the European Commission in 2011, describes interseksualnykh people as being differed from the transseksualnykh or transgendernykh, since their state refers not to genderu, but to their biological structure, which corresponds exclusively neither to masculine nor feminine sex, and it is typical for both simultaneously or not characteristically nor for one of them.
These characteristics can be manifested in the second sexual signs, such as muscular mass, the distribution of hair cover, breast and build; the primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitalia, or in the structure of the chromosomes and hormones.
Report also gives general idea about discrimination, which encounter interseksualnye and transgendernye people in the sphere of employment, and also about the level of oppressions, cruelty and crimes owing to the prejudices.
The boys with the gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already permit adult to place man, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June 52 the -year inhabitant of Australia Norri Mey-Uelbi became the first in the world person, acknowledged “sexless”, defending in the court right on the retention “indeterminate” sexual status for life.
According to the communication of the ministry of internal affairs, in the German passports will be used the third designation in addition to M and F — the X, i.e., interseksualnyy.
In adjacent France gender questions still cause contradictions, according to news release on the channel of France 24.
In 2011 ten legislators from France, this clearly expressed Catholic country, signed petition about the withdrawal “gender theory” from the school textbooks.
The American Web site of Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, after writing that “in the situation, when peace is pulled into the new state, where the gender is the object of selection, and sexual activity is not, we turn over the two additional pillars of civilization”.
One mother of the newly born child of Maryland also reported to the Web site of Baby Zone that she would prefer so that to the children would be established gender with the generation.
“To raise child is sufficiently heavy without the additional constraints, especially if you do not know the gender of your child”, she said to Web site for the parents.
Stability and confidence are necessary to children.
Historically children, originated with the male and female sex organs, were called hermaphrodites — by the name of the beautiful Greek god, who possessed signs of both sexes.
And still only ten years ago medical association received gender as the sheet, on which it is possible everything to erase, and then again to draw.
But now many dispute ethical bases for the surgical operation, knowing that the gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make incorrect selection, without knowing, as child will receive the appropriated to it gender, when it grows.
“In the middle of XX century this was called “the pressing psychiatric case””, said rag thrasher.
When such children were born, you rang not to psychiatrist — you rang to surgeon.
The prevailing theory about how to turn with the children with intermediate type genitalia, was proposed by doctor John Mani from Jones's university Khopkinsa, which considered that gender easily yields to change.
It introduced into the rotation term “gender identity” and asserted that the signals of environment, including social — that, as parents they raise child, interact with genes and hormones of child, determining, will man consider himself man or woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as “John/Joan”, his theories proved to be open to question.
It advised to the parents of boy, whose penis was damaged during the negligent cutting, completely castrate child, after removing also his eggs, and to raise him as girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of passage, but this was not so”, said rag thrasher.
When to boy there were about 15 years, it again became boy and it was married the woman.
But into 38 years it committed suicide.
Rag thrasher said that now some doctors still " use this model”.
But in the 1990's, with the arrival of the Internet, people, which survived these operations on the change of gender, they stated about itself, “dissatisfied by result”.
Was such the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year writer from the state of Montana, which was born with the man chromosomes of XY, but intermediate type genitalia.
Doctors could not accurately determine, there were by Li Wu it a large clitoris or small penis, and they were convinced that it never will be able to live “valuable life” of man.
Therefore soon in 1976 external sex organ and eggs of Bruce were surgical removed after its generation, and it brought up as girl.
It began to give female hormones at the age of 12 years.
“I knew that I am not girl”, he described ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very complicated to pose questions.
In 18 years to it was assigned vaginoplastika.
But being found in depression and understanding that something not so, it required medical documentation.
The fact that it learned, was terrible.
I was sterilized with the generation, and no one told never to me about this.
Bruce was born with the disturbance of sexual development, which did not give to his body to perform sufficiently genitalia testosterone for the normal development.
After learning truth, it again became man, obtaining the pricks of testosterone and after removing its breast.
Operation made its barren.
Today it comes out in defense others in the organization by the name of Interface Project, attempting to lead the perception of people with the intersexuality into the standard.
But Anne Temar-Mettis, executive director of California juridical association Advocates for Informed Choice, is perturbed fact that the German law “impels to the mounting of labels and stigma”.
“Many activists are perturbed fact that the German law will impel parents to make hasty decision and to give to child “the indeterminate gender””, she said.
We fear, that it will contribute to interference.
We consider that it is better to appropriate masculine or feminine sex, and then to wait.
But we yet did not see, as will appear itself this law; therefore everything that we can make, this to build assumptions.
Temar-Mettis said that its organization supports Australian law, since “it makes possible for adult people to make a selection in favor of the third gender”.
“Adult people must have the capability to make their own decisions about the formal sexual belonging”, she says.
German law implies its awarding with the generation.
This is the battle, into which small children must not enter in this stage.
When they grow, then they can make decisions relative to their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barats, mammolog-roentgenologist from Pittsburgh, in which there is a daughter with the disturbance of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people in the group of support, she said that the German law will " support” both the parents and children.
The daughter of Barats, To keti, was born with the man chromosomes; however, it has a disturbance of sexual development by the name “syndrome of complete insensitivity to the androgens”.
Since its androgenic receptors incorrectly work, in To keti developed female signs.
It has a sheath, but there are no womb and ovaries.
Now, into 29 years, To keti married passes permanent appointment in children's psychiatry to the university of Pennsylvania.
It is barren in spite of the fact that, it hopes to become parent by means of adoption or gestatsionnogo surrogate motherhood.
“Law gives to parents time in order not to assume the hasty solutions themselves”, said Barats.
It gives to them time to make some analyses and to be dismantled into the situation, and also time interval before they will write “man” or “female”.
In that case you in the order — grow child, you love child.
You have a wonderful child, and you perceive happiness.
We should in a hurry make the operation, which is not reversed.
“This makes possible for children to participate in the solution and removes the unrest, which moves by parents, because they do not feel, that they enter correctly”, she said.
Finally child will solve, with what gender to him or by it is more comfortable, this is noticeable.
This gives the opportunity to make a decision to children independently.
Secretary of State of the USA: intelligence agencies now and then “went too far” with the data collection
The Secretary of State of the USA John Kerry recognized that with the data collection and proslushkakh the American intelligence agencies now and then “went too far”, nevertheless politician noted that the appeared in media outlets information about proslushke 70 million people does not correspond to reality.
I assure you, that the innocent people in the course of this process did not suffer, but the attempt to gather information was.
Yes, in certain cases this went too far and it bore incorrect nature.
I recognize this, as it recognizes and the President… and we will follow the fact so that this it would not occur in the future”, it cites the Secretary of State of AFP.
The experts of equestrian measures, who assemble into cardiff in order to battle for the prize “the horse of year”, knew that the competition will be very high.
But no one was ready to the appearance of three-year-old Fentona Kirklanda.
Even not schoolchild, only for several months to this made his first steps, this little-one with his ward by the shetland pony of Toffi at a trot rushed past through three stages in order with the ease to take main prize, after leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable of para- identical increase — obtained appreciations for the exterior view, behavior and style at the yearly competition, which is carried out by the center of the horse sport of Sannibenk in Radri city not far from cardiff.
After leaving to the universal review against the background of men and women in the elegant hat-pots, it moved its aslant cap and proudly it conducted in the circle of two-year-old Toffi.
Judges praised Fentona after it entirely not over the years the developed innate abilities of rotation with the horses.
But Toffi obtained the highest estimation for the exterior view and nature.
To Fentonu they presented to Toffi on its third birthday in March of last year, and from those times it was occupied with the shetland pony each day.
Its 30-year mother of Donna said: “Fenton and Toffi compose excellent duet”.
They had many rivals, but these two left the gold goblet and rozochkoy.
This was only its second appearance from Toffi, and we everything were excited, when it won.
Completely unknown people in the arena considered it its such phenomenal that they wanted to photograph with it.
This boy from the village Nantiglo, that not far from Ebb-Veyl in southern Wales, goes along the feet of his aunt Sharon Khauels, which advances horses during more than 10 years.
Mrs. Khauels said: “Entire public was struck, and all screamed out encouraging exclamations and flapped”.
It ran along the sand throughout the entire length of arena and, although it appeared such tiny, wonderfully made its matter.
Fenton without the mind from animals — it loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens, about which it worries.
Judging by how it began, in the very near future it will already participate in “the horses of year” — and I am assured that he will come out well.
The representative of this yearly horse exhibition said: “To Fentonu only three years, but he knows how to turn with its pony”.
Together they are outstanding commands.
Judges noted Fentona and Toffi for their exterior view and for that, as they presented themselves on the show-ring.
They evaluate the coordination of the appearance of pony and factory owner — Fenton and Toffi were best on the ring.
I am confident, that Fentonu helped his attractive detail, it actually looked well in its role.

Court stopped execution of the decision by the practice “stop-and-to search” in the New York department of the police
On Thursday the court of appeals of federal region stopped the performance of the judicial decision, which requires changes in the program “stop-and-to search” the New York department of the police, and it removed judge from the matter.
The court of appeals of the second region of the USA stated that the execution of the decision of judge Shiry Sheyndlin will be stopped before obtaining of the results of appeal, subject by city.
In August judge it decreed, that the city destroyed constitution in how it ran program on the street detentions and examination.
City gave appeal of its solution and the decision about the corrective measures, including order to appoint controller in order to help police station to change the practice of work and training program connected with it.
On Thursday court of appeals heard rotting sides on the petition about the stopping of the matter.
Court of appeals stated about the need of the outlet of judge because it destroyed the Code of Conduct of the judges of the USA and was not calculated with the need for avoiding the demonstration of bias, partially because of a series of interview in media outlets and official statements, which contain public answer to the criticism of court.
Judge it decreed, that the officers of the police destroyed civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unjustifiably turning to the black and latinoamerikantsam according to the program “stop-and-to search”.
It appointed external controller for the supervision of the scale changes, which include reforms in field politician, instructions also of control, and also it decreed to launch pilot program on testing of those attached on tele- video cameras in those police stations, where occurs the majority of detentions.
In August New York arrived at the solution to end the practice of storage of names and addresses of people, the matters on which were ended after police checking.
Rotting on the appeal cities must take place after March 14, 2014.
Tactics “to stop and to search” criticized by many attorneys on the civil rights.
“Stoppage-search” practices already several decades in one or another form; however, a quantity of documented stoppages sharply increased with the administration of the independent mayor of Michael Bloomberg, after reaching in 2011 absolute record into 684 330 people, majority of which are black and latinoamerikantsy.
In 2004 four people, everyone — the representatives of national minorities, gave to the court collective lawsuit.
_supporter change in program “stop-and-search” in New York department police say, that these change put end unconscientious practice, form more reliable and effective police service and can influence on that, as other department police realize this practice.
Opponents assert that the changes will lower the combat spirit of policemen, but not the level of criminality, they will lead to the unnecessary expenditures of money and will not solve the more global issue of complex conditions in the police because of the decrease of a quantity of officers by several thousand in the last decade.
Judge it noted that it does not cease the practice “stop-and-to search”, which corresponds to constitution; however, changes the method, such as the New York police stops people.
Azarov promised the collapse of prices of the goods after the signing of association with the European Union to Ukrainians
The Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that the prices in the country considerably will be lowered after the country it will sign agreement about the association with the European Union.
About this he stated in the course of communication with the readers of its page on “Facebook”.
I can definitely say that the prices are determined by the large number of factors, among which there are, including and customs payments.
So here, after the signing of agreement and coming into force of position about the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties in merchandise import from the European Union considerably will be lowered.
But this will mean that and the prices must be lowered.
“This concerning goods, which enter from the countries the European Union”, wrote Azarov.
However, as far as other goods are concerned, influence of agreement on the prices will not be such straight line, it will be defined by example.
But, nevertheless, there also there must not be price hike.
Therefore communication on bilbordakh, which recently sufficiently much appeared in our country, that association with the European Union - this is an increase in the prices, this not entirely so, or if we more precisely say - entirely not then”, summed up Azarov.
Packet of rescue measures in size of $325 of million for public health of Tasmania
Federal Government insists on what the packet of rescue measures in size of $325 of million for the weakened system of public health of Tasmania will be augmented by the merciless terms, which guarantee, that the government of state will not spend means for nothing.
The Federal Minister of public health Tanya Plibersek it declared, which collaboration assumes “urgent measures” in order to avoid the crisis, caused by aging the population of this island state, by the higher level of chronic diseases and by the limitations of system.
The solution about the financing for four years was accepted after the consultations of government with the independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkes.
“Government proposed the packet of special rescue measures, which, we believe, it will solve particular problems, confronting the state”, stated today Mrs. Plibersek.
Packet with size $325 of million includes $31 million to the blitz campaign on the planned operations.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and operations in terms of the removal of cataract, will help to overcome delay.
Are also money for the clinics, which assume patients without the preliminary record, in Khobarte and Lonsestone, for an improvement in the quality of withdrawal after hospital, the instructions of medical specialists, security services of mental health and introduction of the systems of personal electronic medical charts in the local hospitals.
“These investments will go on those expressed by progressive-minded doctors the realization of ideas about how it is better to help the system of public health of Tasmania”, said Mrs. Plibersek.
Minister it insisted, that the government of Tasmania will work in the regime of a strict account and responsibility.
To state will have to support the current levels of financing in order to obtain the cash resources of collaboration, and to monthly report about that, where it spends these additional means.
Will be created commission of three people, in order to ascertain that the state allows services how more effective as possible and it is more efficient.
Mr. Wilkes stated today that $325 will solve million nothing, “if them does not follow the authentic reform, which will place the system of public health of Tasmania on the steadier basis”.
Nevertheless it praised government for the answer to its request about the urgent aid, with which it for the first time turned to the Prime Minister into the beginning of May.
“I hope that the packet of federal aid will considerably contribute to the output of the system of public health of this state from the critical state”, said Mr. Wilkes.
According to the data of the government of state, these additional selective procedures to a considerable degree compensate recent reductions.
But federal opposition representative on public health Peter Datton considers that today's statement is “the solution, similar to adhesive tape”.
“The reason, for which we here, lies in the fact that the Labor Government of state pulled out $430 million of the system of public health”, he said the television network of ABC TV.
When the government of state tears off almost half-billion dollars, and collaboration packs 300 million, it cannot be been shut that these are good news.
Mr. Datton requested Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee, that not one dollar of the rescue packet will be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Cry of the desperation of the voter of Obama
I voted for President Obama twice, dividing hope for the opportunity of the changes
He indicates that Obama allowed the obstructionism of Republicans to bring together on no praiseworthy efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as the justification for problems with the Web site of that reformed by Obama the system of public health, attack of the drones
Memoirs about the campaign of Obama 2008 are sad reminding about that which could be
Nathaniel P. Morris — student of the second course of the medical department of Harvard University.
I read the terribly sad book during these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me in the times of despondency in the second course of medical department and will revive in me a feeling of hope.
It is called “impudence for the victory”, and these are memoirs about the presidential campaign of Barack Obama 2008.
When I in the evening conclude to write reports on my patients and bed into the bed, this book returns me when policy inspired millions of people, and appearances could seize spirit.
Victory on the elections proved to be impressive, and those leading of news programs made pause for the comprehension of this historical moment.
My classmates cried from happiness, while my parents coast all newspapers, which they only could find.
In the White House had to arrive the young command of strategists, and people was ready to changes.
During Obama's entry into the post in 2008 his level of support composed 82%.
Then I shut the book.
Recovery at present is rough awakening as extraction from the dream.
It is difficult to recall those days of optimism — they seem by distant memory, by sad reminding about the missed opportunities.
In the years, which passed from those times, as I lowered my first ballot, changes actually occurred.
This was that I even could not visualize.
I return proper for his great and diverse achievements to Obama, from the adoption of law about the accessible medical aid to the removal of our servicemen from Iraq, the cancellation of rule “do not ask, do not say”, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I consider that the party obstructionism blocked too many at attempts the advance of our country forward: immigration reform, the opportunity of the selection of state public health and closing base in Guantanamo among other.
But after the countless number of times, when I occurred on the side of Obama's administration, protecting it before the colleagues and contemporaries, in me ended the explanations, which I can grant.
I reached the point of political desperation.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain permission to proslushku of foreign leaders or inflicting of impacts by drones according to the innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the data collection about the private life of Americans by the agency of national security or pursuit of exposers, who reveal incorrect government's actions.
It cannot explain the murder of the American citizen of Anwar al-Awlaki without the court and consequence or the nonobservance of the limits of state financing and expenditures during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of the report, in which it is indicated that the applied by the White House efforts, in order to make it necessary to become silent media outlets, are “most aggressive… from the times of the administration of Nixon”.
And recently it cannot justify that the fact that does not succeed in developing the simple Web site for more than three years after the signing of law about the accessible medical aid.
I do not know, this to me it was to be expected.
Must was I at the age of 18 years understand, that the management can contradict the political campaigns, which it do precede?
It is obvious that the work on the elected office is not the predictable activity plan, since our public dialogue will be formed with opposition political party and such random events as slaughter in Newtown.
Nevertheless on all by enumerated by me above to examples it is evident that they were to a considerable degree their own selection of administration.
And this that which disturbs me most of all.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm apropos of his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was incomprehensible and rough alternative, it seemed that it cannot make a decision by its own policy or views.
I assumed that within his second period Obama, after being freed from the pressure of future elections, will justify the hopes, about which we heard during this long time.
However, when on this week Obama's rating descended below 45%, to return in 2008 by means of this book it began considerably more difficultly.
This forces me to long for many promises, which were evaporated.
On this week I read that part of the book, in which he is described, as Clinton it applied to Obama deafening defeat on the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting according to the analysis of causes for failure he said to its colleagues that they must return into the normal river bed and remain true to their purpose.
“I want so that we would return our attractiveness, he said.
— We must remember about that, who we”.
It passed five years, Mr. the President, and I with you am completely agreeable.

In Egypt the first freely elected president takes the oath
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration will hardly signify by itself the end of political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised “new Egypt”, when he brought oath, after becoming the first freely elected president of the country, after replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was thrown down 16 months ago.
Also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and fifth Head of State in Egypt after the overthrow of monarchy of approximately 60 years ago at its inauguration before the supreme Constitutional Court of Morsi.
It accepted the oath before 18 judges in the black mantles in court building on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of ancient Egyptian temple.
“We strive for best future, new Egypt and second republic”, said Morsi during the solemn ceremony, shown live on the government television.
“Today Egyptian people placed the bases of new life — uncontrolled freedom, authentic democracy and stability”, stated Morsi, 60-year engineer with the American formation from “the Muslim Brotherhood”, Fundamentalist group, which large part of 84 years of its existence was the forbidden organization, which served as target for the rigid actions of the changed each other governments.
Building guarded hundreds of soldiers and policemen, when Morsi arrived with the small cortege soon after 11 mornings local time.
Only several hundred supporters were assembled in court building in order to greet the new President, and, in contrast to the presidential pump of Mubarak's times, motion was stopped only to the short period in order to pass his auto-transport group along the usually lively road, which connects city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi they ridiculed as nekharizmatichnoe “spare wheel” “brothers”, his personal prestige sharply grew from the moment of his victory and Friday appearance, in which it attempted to present itself as the candidate not only of Islamists, also all those, who want to bring the matter of the uprising of 2011 against authoritarian Mubarak to the end.
“Today Egypt is civil, national, constitutional and modern state”, said Morsi, dressed in the dark-blue business suit with the red necktie, to judges in the sheathed by wooden panels hall, where he accepted oath.
Later than Morsi it was directed to the Cairo university, where it had to pronounce its inauguratsionnuyu speech.
To it was shown official method with the army orchestra, which carried out the national anthem, during which it stood on the counter “quietly”.
Was present military man field marshal Hussein Tantawi.
Its arrival was encountered by slogan “army and people — one hand”, which they scanned hundred gathering in the main lecture hall of university.
The based in 1908 as stronghold of secular formation, Cairo university in the 1970's years became the stronghold of Islamic student groups.
Morsi accepted symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, where was conceived the uprising, which completed the authoritarian administration of Mubarak in the past year, and it promised to return the authorities of the President, of which his post was deprived by military council, which accepted the matters from the thrown down leader.
But after agreeing to accept the official oath before the court, but not before the parliament, as is customary, it carries out the will of servicemen, and this is the sign of the fact that the power contest will continue.
The speech of Morsi on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools issued a call to pay greater attention to mathematics, orthographies and to the grammar
The school courses of English literature will require that the students would study at least one play of Shakespeare, the novel of XIX century, romantic poetry and contemporary British artistic literature since 1914.
At the examination will be also represented “extra-program texts” in order to encourage more extensive reading.
The united course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015 students will be obligated to pass separate final examination on the language, with the persistent recommendations of the selection of English literature as the separate examination.
The department of formation must tomorrow release new curricula in the English and mathematics — to first objects, subjected to radical revision.
It will introduce changes in other basic objects in the following year.
The separately control in the sphere of the examinations of OFQUAL will present the reviewed structure of the final examinations of secondary school, with the new system of estimations and smaller volume of course works.
Coming out as summer, Minister of Education Michael Gouv said that there was “they will reach the wide consensus in the fact that we must reform our system of examinations in order to return public confidence”, insisting, that the school final examinations will be “more complex, more ambitious and stricter”.
Studies show that the English schools give less than the time mathematician (116 hours per year, or three hours in the week during fourth), than in the majority of the countries.
For the comparison — Australian schools give on the average 143 hours per year, and in Singapore students are occupied about 138 hours.
Although formal requirement to give more than time in the timetable mathematician it will not, sources in the coalition said that scale school final examinations in mathematics in combination with the increased coefficient in the table it was rating, they will most likely serve as stimulus for the assignment by the schools of additional instruction on this object.
In the training program more than attention will be given “to the tasks from the real life”, including financial mathematics.
Football - reason for dissension?
In the State Duma of the within the framework “open platform” of policy and the experts spoke about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was sounded similar: to forbid football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - some scandals and dissension.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin remembered about the recent events in Biryuleve and said that for reduction “in the degree of tension in the society” of policy and media outlet they must be correct in the statements.
Probably, it had the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, which in one of the telecasts threatened to surround the Caucasus by barbed wire, if there they do not want to limit birth rate…
All appearing spoke both about the measures for the regulation of migration from the countries of CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and about the measures for the harmonization of the relations between the peoples, which populate Russia, which gave discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoryev stated that event in Biryuleve - “the model conflict, which could be forecast”, but “for these questions answers too many people and instances”, and in seven nurses child without eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which long time in the attitude of migrants practiced Europe, in the opinion of the public worker, fell through, and it is necessary to search for its way.
Historian Yuri Petrov laid large hopes for the new united textbook of history.
“It is still necessary to create benefit on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that the schoolchildren in Tatarstan would know that after people they live in Daghestan, and vice versa”, it reported.
Gennadiy Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for “calls to the breakdown of Russia”: “If we in the USA say on the radio that it is necessary to return Alaska of Russia, then you they arrest and will give 20 years of prison!”
Vladimir Zhirinovsky greatly tried “not to kindle”.
As usual, of everything it accused the journalists, who will carry sick and acute national problems to the public discussion: “In to the flame of controversy it is small whether that it is possible to say!”
The leader of fraction “United Russia” Vladimir Vasil'yev here advised to journalists to conclude “charter” and to agree news conversations on this theme accurately, and then the same obligations can take upon themselves and policy.
Are accepted about 30 laws, which regulate migration, and order as a whole is established, Mr. Vasil'yev stated.
As an example it gave the law, which lays on the regional and municipal authorities responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Ludmila Andrichenko enthusiasm apropos of this law it did not divide: in it there are no “clear ideas about the fact that such is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
It means, subjects will treat differently the volume of these authorities.
Moreover the municipalities do not have personnel, necessary for resolution of such complex questions, there are no means, and the systematic recommendations, which they could use, center does not give to them…
The head of Duma committee on the matters of nationalities Gadzhimet Safaraliev it proposed to create special department with the terrible name “ministry of national security”, which would deal with questions of national policy.
But Valerie Tishkov, who in the 90's headed similar department, abolished subsequently, came out against.
It suffices to have at the federal level of special person, “minister without the briefcase”, to which it would be possible to turn, if that.
“We walk along the edge, projectiles vomit by a number, it is very important to the representatives of different ethnoses and religions to together speak against provocations, and this work must obtain worthy information support”, said the representative of the ROC (Russian Orthodox Church) for connections with the society of Vsevolod Chaplin.
No neutrality of state with respect to the dangerous ideologies, religious including to be, in his opinion, it is must.
Here Oleg Nilov it took away discussion into the unexpected river bed: “More talented people than in Chechnya or Daghestan, still looked must be, but them they push not to that way, not to that road”, he said.
“Not that road” - this is the development of the football: “First football player they beat up to entire crowd, first flags plait, then comrades cover by the stones of each other…
Maybe, is not necessary to us this football?
There is another form of sport - rugby it is called…
“Equal to them it will not be in the world in this form of sport!” - hotly spoke spravoross.
Rugby in the Caucasus no one will be! - here interfered Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You another kerling to them will propose!
It is necessary to know national special features, this nevertheless that to Georgian “Dnieper Cossack” to propose”…
In Yaroslavl' wild behavior on the platforms were characterized by the representatives of Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football it is necessary to forbid in the entire country…
The acknowledgements of the agency of national security strengthen paranoia of corporations with respect to the state shadowing
By warm day at the end of August the helicopter of the German police flew the low- above the consulate USA in Frankfurt, financial capital of Germany.
In accordance with instruction the Federal Service of the protection of constitution (BfV), service of the internal reconnaissance of Germany, its task it was photograph the roof of the building of the representation of the USA, which is found less than in 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
German media outlets indicate that BfV hoped to reveal the antennas of the overhearing devices, and these actions involved the talks between the USA and ministry of foreign affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Klepper, director of national intelligence of the USA, in September again certified, that the USA does not use the opportunity of external reconnaissance “for the embezzlement of the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of American companies in order to increase their international competitive ability or to increase their profit”.
But from those times, as Edward Snouden — contract employee, who became exposer — began to publish his treasure-house of the secrets of the reconnaissance of the USA, European government and the leaders of companies no longer were assured, is it possible to believe to director for the word.
Communications, that the national security agency of the USA followed the Brazilian oil company of Petrobras and was obtained access to the given, stored in the suppliers of cloud services USA, including Google and Yahoo, raised paranoia of corporations, caused by the shadowing of state, to the new heights.
Last drop became information about the fact that the telephone of the chancellor of Angela Merkel was heard, possibly, about ten years.
If most influential persona of Europe can become target, then, of course, potential targets are the leaders of business.
Snouden made obvious intensive collaboration between the intelligence services of the USA and companies.
I think, it is completely probable that these data are used with the mutual advantage.
“Germany must awake”, says Oliver Grun, the President of the association of BITMi, which introduces the small and average IT-companies of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the USA now presents very nearly the same risk as China, in the region of industrial espionage and embezzlement of the data, according to the study, published in July by the consulting agency of EY.
In all documents, opened by Mr. Snoudenom, nevertheless, until now, there was no evidence of the fact that the USA transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politics they expressed apprehension fact that the European Union specific opportunities in region of information technology and Internet are not sufficient, and they expressed the opinion that it one should attempt to decrease its dependence on the USA.
Businessmen skeptically relate to this.
Someone in the parliament of Germany indicates that we must create German Google.
I can only shut eyes and slowly open them again…
“This is not version”, says Gasso Plattner, the President of the German of the company-supplier of software for the business of SAP.
If there is a need for powerful European IT-industry, did not cost to make possible for it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to the automobiles and farmers.
Everything, except IT-industry.
And nevertheless the scope and technical state of development of agencies for espionage of the USA, which became known because of the revelations of Snoudena, were shock for some companies, which earlier thought that the largest risk of shadowing represents China.
Large shift occurs in the cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies better realized, that the data, which are stored in the USA, are found in the same jurisdiction and therefore it is potentially vulnerable.
According to the study, carried out by the commercial association of Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American participants turned from plans to use services of the located to the USA cloud provider after the disclosure of American program for the intellectual data analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneyb, one of the executive directors of SAP, he said: “We see that the users pose the new question, which did not appear year ago, namely: where my data are stored and you can guarantee, that they physically will remain in this jurisdiction”.
Many German leaders assert that last communications — this is the only confirmation of the fact that they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, therefore, these data must be guarded by any price.
The fact that occurs economic espionage, is not surprising.
It always occurred.
“This was the object of consideration many years and substantially it did not change in the current controversy”, says jackets side, the chief executive officer of the chemical company of BASF.
Americans spy after us at the commercial and industrial level, and we also after them spy, because this enters into our national interests — to protect our commercial enterprises.
Leaders corporations do not usually love to brag by those reciprocal measures, which they undertook, since this can grant advantage to enemy.
In the important companies has already long ago been mastered the thought, what to take free flash drive at the exhibition or to leave laptop computer without the care in the number of hotel — this, at least, is inconsiderate.
Ulrich Khakenberg, the member of the board of directors of the auto-building company of Audi, says that already many years this the standard practice — to gather the cell phones before the sessions of administration, so that they could not be used as the overhearing devices.
The Federal Service of the protection of the constitution of Germany recommends to the leaders of companies the examining of the opportunity of using the simple predoplachennykh cell phones during the trips abroad because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The Predoplachennye cell phones subsequently are ejected.
Nevertheless there are the fears that the small and average companies remain vulnerable for the breakings and shadowing.
In Germany many similar companies are leaders on the World Market in their concrete niche.
“To small and average companies frequently are not sufficient experience, colleagues and financial resources, in order to effectively protect corporate secrets from the unsanctioned access”, it prevents in the report to BfV.
The USA warns their own companies about economic espionage from the side of other countries.
The national intelligence summary of the USA in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in the second row of the disturbers, who are occupied by hacking for the economic reconnaissance, after China, The Washington Post asserts.
The Council member of the directors of prestigious German company confirmed that when the discussion deals with economic espionage, “the French are worse than all”.
Bernard Skarsini, the former leader of the French agency of the internal prospecting of DCRI, as it communicates, he stated in the interview in this month: “Services excellently know that all countries, even when they collaborate in the combating of terrorism, spy after their allies”.
The International Airport of Los Angeles was evacuated because of the shooting in one of the terminals.
Unknown man opened fire in the third terminal into 09.30 local time on Friday November 1 (20.30 msk [Moscow Time]).
Protection evacuated colleagues and passengers of the second and third terminal.
According to the preliminary data, the man conducted shooting from the rifle of high power.
Several man, including the colleague for the administration for safety in the field of transportation of the USA, were injured.
The police opened return fire and detained criminal.
It is easily injured.
Tripodi it denies, that it is subjected to the influence of Obeyda
The former minister of labor of new southern Wales of Joe Tripodi will be the pretender of the investigation of the anti-corruption regulatory organ of this state.
The former minister of new southern Wales Joe Tripodi refutes the introduction of changes in the order of the lease of seaside objects on the request of his political teacher Eddie Obeyd, who secretly managed portions in three objects of real estate on the state earth.
The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday enlarged its investigation of that, did lobby Mr. Obeyd in several ministers of state prolongation the agreements of lease to Serkyular Ci, where to the family of Obeydov belong two restaurants and cafes, without the passage of tender after the time expiration of their action in August 2005.
It now investigates assertions about the fact that Mr. Tripodi knew about the secret participation of Mr. Obeyd in the objects of real estate, after the indications, given by the former Deputy Head of Administration of Mr. Tripodi Lynn Eshpoul on Thursday.
For several years of discussions, which were begun in 2005, the government insisted on lease being advanced on the open competition.
Leaseholders were against this, and they also wanted more the prolonged periods of lease.
In 2009 the agreements of the lease of enterprises to Serkyular Ci, which brought to the family of Obeydov of approximately $2.5 million per year, were prolonged without the nomination to the open competition.
Mr. of Tripodi, who was the minister of infrastructure and transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially it spoke in favor of the open competitions.
But it denied, that the changes were introduced on Mr. Obeyd's request, who, as recognized Mr. of Tripodi, imperatively advised to introduce changes in the lease policy of government.
In the represented ICAC interpretation of telephone conversations were given conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeyd, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dannom, senior official, who arrived into the ministry of ports after work under Mr. Obeyd's leadership in the division of fishing.
“Was the question, which was being discussed in the course of these telephone conversations, a question of the development of the policy of commercial lease?” — asked the assistant to commissioner Anthony Uili Mr. Tripodi.
“No”, answered Mr. Tripodi. —
I cannot recall that it was discussed, but definitely this was not that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeyd.
The UN declares new purposes on overcoming of the poverty

Then when to color entrance, to bring into order staircases or even to replace elevator - decide there will be tenants themselves.
The deputies of provincial thought approved this law.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of Voronezh provincial thought, it noted: “In this matter it is also necessary to introduce order - to establish the priority of the overhaul of the houses, to accumulate means not in the controlling companies - which often record first in Moscow, first in the Orenburg, then still somewhere, this there will be the establishment of the government control over the expense of the resources, which gather the inhabitants to the repair of apartment houses”.

It was possible to solve the problems of majority.
By the way, new law prescribes rights and responsibilities for all participants in the longitudinal building.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of Voronezh provincial thought, he stated: “It is no secret that in this sphere also began the abuses, connected with the fact that 98-m to year the individual investors the same fell, and in 2000-e years the same individual investors.”
People began on this to earn in order to cover hole, including they accepted these two laws.
Under Voronezhem it is decided to construct the center of the sojourn for the foreign citizens, who are subject to deportation.
Provincial parliament accepted this law not only under the pressure of federation.
Although detract the problems, connected with the illegal migrants in the region.
Thus, in last year to the migratory calculation arose only more than 100,000 foreigners.
But only each fifth designed official permission to the work.
Where rest work and they do pay taxes - large question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of Voronezh provincial thought, described: “They destroyed legislation, but they are not criminals.”
Vessels no, and to deport is necessary - they must be somewhere contained.
This decision federation made, that due to the regional means such places to equip.

For the left shore or southwest city block - completely acceptable version.
Well, and in the regional center for this sum it is possible to purchase already entire cottage.
The Centers for Disease Control and Maintenance released recommendation for the schools, the being concerned allergies in the children
On Wednesday the Centers for Disease Control and Maintenance published the enumeration of recommendations regarding the checking of food allergies in children in the schools.
This is the first enumeration of similar recommendations, which released the U.S. Government, while a quantity of children of school age, who suffer from the food allergy, grows.
Now one of 20 children in the USA has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Maintenance explained that the prevalence of food allergy among the children increased by 18 percent since 1997 until 2007.

It also recommends to schools the holding of the reserves of adrenaline — most frequently for the injections is used the automatic medical syringe of EpiPen — for rendering aid with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative bodies recently introduced changes in regulations in order to allow schools to make the reserves of adrenaline with the smaller difficulties.

Children can say: “this sensation, as if something tychet into my language”, “such sensation, that I in the language have hair” or “language pinches”.
Kenyan press is agitated by provocative law about the media outlets
“This terrible place, and is bases for the question: what can not allow destruction by the parliament of the independence of judicial system in the future? ”, reported newspaper, calling law unconstitutional.
“This law very severe both punitive and we reject it”, said Sayrus Kamau, the managing director of Capital Group — maternal company of CapitalFM, into which enters one of the most independent radio stations respected in Kenya and news site.
He said that the new judicial organ for the mass media “will be always partial, since it is the continuation of government”, and the limitations of content and advertisement will do harm to the position of Kenya in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we turn to it with the request to deflect this bill and to return to its deputies”, he said.
According to the newspaper of The Star, new law in the essence will allow government “to take media outlets by dead grasp”, and it reported to The Standard that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya " obtained serious impact”, and criticized severely bill as “Draconian”.
The adoption of bill is the part of the measures, undertaken for strengthening the national security after September attack of Muslim terrorists in the shopping center of Westgate.
Kenyan media outlets aroused anger of authorities, transmitting the records of the cameras of the observation, where the troops, which were sent for the place of attack, supposedly rob expensive shopping center.
The reaction of the chief of the police David Kimayo became the call of two journalists and official media outlet to the examination, although the call was abolished after mass protests media outlets.
According to the new law of publishing house they can be penalized for the sum to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists — to one million with the additional risk to be “excluded from the lists”, i.e., to obtain prohibition to obtaining of official journalistic accreditation.
Court also has the right to confiscate property of disturber, if penalty will not be paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even one penalty it is sufficient in order it to paralyze the work of the majority of Fm-radio stations”.
It also reported that these measures can show destructive effect on the so-called “lively blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politics they understand, that, after forcing media outlets to become silent, they can do everything which by them will decide, with impunity.
“No one learns never”, wrote the journalist of Nation Mutuma of Matthew, characterizing Kenyan media outlets as the key source of the restrictive and balancing strengths in public life.
“Given to themselves policy razoryat the country and they will return us to the hunting and sobiratelstvu”, it wrote.
Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for the cancellation of the reductions, appointed as national commission for wages, and the restoration of the amount of their enormous wage, which is about 532,000 shillings per month, not assessed taxes, one of the high in the world.
Inspectors check information about the brutal treatment with the child in Biyske
On October 29 the mass media published communication, that governess of one of kindergartens of city was Biysk for educational purposes it locked child in the basement.
All circumstances are at present explained by inspectors, and juridical estimation is also given to the actions of the colleagues of kindergarten.
It addressed after charge in Yevgeny Vasil'yev's durnovkusii
Yevgeny Vasil'yev, to persona of which almost year is riveted close attention media outlets, until now, never commented on numerous publications in the press both about the embezzlements into the Ministry of Defense and about it personally - relations with the ex-minister of defense Anatoly Serdyukov, its poetry and about the predilection to the valuable things.
However, on November 1 the figurante of the affair “of OboronServis [Defense Service]” destroyed silence.
In Vasil'yev's interview for Life News she stated: “Task was originally, of course, exactly one: to take out of me any negative information in the attitude of the former Minister of Defense”.
There was blackmail to the object of the fact that I must give indications, they will otherwise me plant into the prison.
Today these threats ceased.
Further we go into the court, we will prove its innocence.
In the victory we are assured by 100 percent.
In this case of the interview it is possible to draw the conclusion that, perhaps, most of all to Vasil'yev caught the words about that which in it is unimportant with the taste.
Probably, has the statement of the official representative of SK (Investigative Committee) RF Vladimir Markin, that in the collection of pictures, which gathered the figurante of the affair “of OboronServis [Defense Service]”, were revealed forgeries.
Among arrested property there is a number of the pictures, which the owner, being of confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as the masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art criticism examination, appointed as inspectors after the arrest of these pictures, established that they have no artistic value and, simply speaking, they are cheap forgeries”, noted Markin at the beginning of October.
Some pictures, stolen in Defense Ministry…
They then nevertheless recognized that they from the Ministry of Defense were not stolen, in this case they said that in me it is bad with the taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion this is simple unthinkable situation”, he says Vasil'yev.
In this case to a question, it does recognize its fault although in one of 12 responsible by it criminal episodes, Vasil'yev it stated: “Naturally, no.
To recognize generally something.
Moreover, there is no damage whatever to the Russian Federation, with which deals the discussion.
Simply is led people into error, here and everything.
Furthermore, in response to today's statement SK (Investigative Committee) RF, that Vasileva deviates from the study of the materials of criminal case, the attorney of figurante stated that to it and to its client “the inspector does not give to become acquainted with the materials of the matter”.
What did serve as reason to the revelations located Vasileva of located under the house arrest, until now, of that not associating with the press?
Possibly, as woman it could not but answer the charge in the poor taste?
But or are right the journalists “of members of the Komsomol”, who asserted the pair of days ago, that it “is hollow into even larger trans- under the house arrest” because of the information about the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with the wife and his return to the bosom of family?
The well-known military reviewer “of KP” Victor Baranets in his article “Serdyukov returned to the wife?” it wrote: “Inspectors do not exclude, that after similar shaking it can become more talkative on the examination”.
Previously Vasil'yev some charges in illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense were taken to itself.

Because of the new rules, introduced by Russian custom-house, already almost week on the border with Russia in the turn stand hundreds of wagons.
Today Donets officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to establish biotualety
In the boundary points with the entrance into Russia hundreds of wagons were saved.
This situation arose because of a change in the rules of the customs formulation of loads.
Ukrainian border-guards and customs officers confirm: the Russian side, which previously did not warn about the innovations, creates turn.
Since October 28 the customs organs of Russia began to use the corollary measures for securing the delivery of loads, reported the deputy chief of eastern custom-house Vladimir Denisov.
The document of new model adapts in the countries, which were joined to the convention about the international transportation.
The points of passage work in the intensive regime.
The correspondent “of FACTS” it was on the border and it met with dalnoboyshchikami, which were proved to be by the hostages of situation.
Prices in the roadside small shop-cafe on the point of the passage “of Novoazovsk” grow with each day as turn from the wagons.
Trucks stand in several numbers, after being extended approximately to two kilometers.
The customs terminal of Novoazovsk - merry-Voznesenka ensures one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
Hence loads are sent for the Stavropol territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday still they released to midnight, and afterward introduced these rules, complains dalnoboyshchik Aleksey Golovanev (on the photo), who conveys by transit through Russia load from Turkey to Kazakhstan and already almost week it passes the night in its machine.
According to the new rules, in order to cross boundary, to me is necessary the additional packet of documents and payment of the insurance of load.
Sum depends on the cost of load and distance, on which it they convey.
Minimum insurance - 4,5−5.000 of rubles (near 1100−1300 10 kopecks).
Those, who will go not far (let us say, into Georgia, Armenia) with the load with cost to 50,000 dollars, they pay the somewhere 15,000 rubles (3800 10 kopecks) and pass.
But rest got stuck - indeed not whom such large money with itself does not have!
You represent, if driver conveys load for the sum only of four thousand dollars, but azh into Moscow, it should pay 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 10 kopecks) for the transit!
Conditions for the survival on the border - any, lament dalnoboyshchiki, which were arranged are near their machines.
In the near-boundary stores and cafe and so it is always dear, but such prices as here, we nowhere met!
Salesmen were oriented and them they rapidly raised: 15 10 kopecks costs long loaf, seven 10 kopecks - cup of coffee, 25 10 kopecks - plate of soup.
But kafeshka-that one.
And there is no toilet.
In the steppe we sleep, there we walk into the toilet.
Neither to be washed nor to shave…
I can and week from the machine not leave, to me wife for the journey all stocked up on.
I will lengthen week, comforts itself another dalnoboyshchik of Victor Skotarenko.
Only will reach my machine turn in the week?
How much in you one-and-a-half liter of vodichki? - we are interested in the only near-boundary small shop.
There is on 11 and on 15 10 kopecks.
What, the bottle crystal or water is infused on silver?
We have cafe, but not store.
Take, until something still exists, it counters salesgirl.
After situation they began to illuminate in media outlets, to the miserable situation of Ukrainian drivers they focused attention to the authority of region.
The management of Amvrosievskoy and Novoazovskoy raygosadministratsiy obtained commission to provide all, who stay in the turn on the Ukrainian-Russian boundary, with drinking water, stated the acting chairman of Donets oblgosadministratsii Sergey Dergunov.
Now in the points of passage the brigades of ambulance are on duty.
For convenience in the people will be also established biotualety.
According to the official, the problem, connected with the turns, will be solved already within the next few days.
As reports the press service of Donets oblgosadministratsii, due to the state on October 31 in the international points of the passage “of Uspenka” and “Novoazovsk” stayed respectively 32 and 68 automobiles.

Sony relies on the lower annual profit
The Japanese manufacturer of electronics, corporation of Sony, after completing the passed block with the clean loss in the size of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 by million, reduced forecast relative to they arrived in the present financial year.
Results of Sony during the period from July to September 2013. they proved to be more depressing than it was expected that it is connected with a drop in the demand for the televisions, video cameras and personal computers of the production of Japanese corporation.
The television business of Sony, in II block which brought company the first in three years operating profit in the size of 5.2 billion yen, in the accounting period again fell to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss.
The Japanese market for consumer electronics survives heavy times, especially because of reduction in the demand for the televisions.
And while competitors attempt to search for output from the complex situation, Sony continues to be concentrated on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals of Sony, the corporation of Panasonic, recently displaces emphases on industrial those completing: here sales to company grow by high rates, especially due to automobile systems and ecologically green technology.
As a result toward the end of the financial year, which will be completed in March 2014; Sony expects to obtain 179 billion yen of operating room they arrived against the expected earlier than 230 billion yen.
In this case, according to the data of the agency of Thomson Reuters, the analysts assumed that this index will be considerably above and it will be 221 billion yen.
Attempting to leave the crisis, Sony enlarges product rule.
In the middle of this month was declared the start of sales “clever” hours from the Japanese corporation, allotted by a number of the fashionable functions, which will make it possible to get rid of the need for on 100 times a day obtaining smartphone from the pocket.
After Sony decreased annual forecast on the profits and to gain, the actions of company in the morning during the discovery of torogov in Tokyo lost in the price more than 11%, after being lowered to the level of 1668 yen for one action.
How much earn deceased celebrities - MK in the USA MK
In 2013 headed the rating of living celebrities with the very high income madonna, who earned 125 million dollars.

Socialist revolutionary proposes to make level the insult of the patriotic feelings with the extremism
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations the directed against Russia and insults “Just Russia” it proposes to make level the insult of patriotic feelings with the extremist activity and to punish for this by five for years prisons.
As it reports the newspaper “Izvestiya”, such corrections into the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of Duma committee on power engineer Oleg Mikheev, it is already directed for obtaining the conclusion into the Supreme Court and government.
By patriotic by feelings of citizens the author of corrections proposes to understand emotional relations of man with the country, citizen of which he is, that is characterized by love for this country, critical relation to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev indicates, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for the outrage above the formal signs of power of the state - by flag and coat of arms.
In this case, in the opinion of the parliamentarian, the protection of the Russians, whose feelings can be caught by the insult of the symbols of state, and by other manifestations of disrespect to our country, in the Russian legislation is studied insufficiently.
As an example it leads those being unfolding yearly on the eve of Day of Victory of the discussion, when some mediynye personas afford to bring into question the heroic exploit of the people of the USSR about the fight with the fascists.
On the eve of the main public holiday - Day of Victory on May 9 - yearly unfolds present bacchanalia.
Practicing the witticism and “alternative view” to the history, some pamphleteers reach the reasonings about the fact that, allegedly, as it is it's a pity, that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider similar absolutely inadmissible in the country, where the pride for the history remains the main “spiritual clamp” of nation”, is agitated Oleg Mikheev.
Furthermore according to Mikheev, the patriotic disposed people in Russia it is considerably more than religious; however, in this case law punishes for the insult of feelings of believers, and to oskorblyat patriotic feeling it is possible practically with impunity.
In the opinion of the people elected official, it is necessary to make level the insult of patriotic feelings with the extremist activity and to prescribe in 282-y to the article of the Criminal Code the appropriate punishment.
Bill provides for punishment for the insult of the patriotic feelings: from the 100-thousandth penalty to 5 summer conclusion.
In the new compositions of public observant commissions the influence of the wardens will grow
Today the council of the Public Chamber (OP) can affirm the new compositions of public observant commissions (ONK) in 43 regions of Russia.
If version the presented for the voting will be accepted, the lobbyists of power figures will increase their influence.
ONK - the public structures, which control the conditions of the content in the places of the deprivation of freedom.
The matters of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhayev, unrest in the kopeyskoy colony - through ONK precisely obtain publicity the majority of resonance incidents after the lattice.
For the control over ONK goes on the fight between human rights activists and lobbyists of power figures.
At the session of workgroup OP on the forming ONK I proposed to make a criterion of selection the experience of human rights activity.
“It they did not accept, and were formed lists, without having manufactured criterion”, says Valerie Borshev.
Borshev - the current chairman of Moscow observant commission and association of the independent observers - All-Russian structure of human rights activists, who carry out prison problems.
In the sojourn by Deputy of the Gosduma from “the apple” it developed the law, which regulates activity ONK.
Council OP must vote for the compositions ONK in 43 regions of the country.
To 1800 vacant places pretend less than thousand those desiring, but in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not organize because of the absence of candidates.
OP promises to organize donabor in the vacant places.
ONK of Moscow - one of a few commissions with the competition, in spite of the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to the data of Borshev, in the current composition of the capital commission of 11 human rights activists and 9 power figures, and in the version, which is found on the voting in OP, relationship changes by 17 to 23.
In this case into the capital commission 30 human rights activists wanted to fall.
Then into the new composition can repeatedly enter the representative “combat brotherhood” Vyacheslav Kalinin.
It three years was term ONK, but never it visited concluded.
Borshev considers that the power figures, after appointing their chairman of ONK, can make work of the human rights activists of that not tolerated; therefore human rights activists do not exclude collective output from the commission.
In their opinion, the advance of power figures coordinates the member of ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads “the officers of Russia” - organization, which defends the interests of power ministries.
“I do not eat babies to the breakfast”, stated RBC [RosBusinessConsulting] daily Anton Tsvetkov.
It denies, which lobbies the advance of any lists and tells that it is not going to prevent human rights activists to attend the arrested oppositionists.
According to it is flowering, it even was not interested, for what list now they vote in pub.
Promulgation by Borshev information it considers the form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights activists - planning change of management by Chelyabinsk ONK.
Its former leaders they will remove because of the last year's kopeyskikh unrests.
In the Public Chamber they came to the conclusion that the leadership of local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But here ONK to Rostov-on-Don can switch over from human rights activists to power figures.
From the new lists “disappeared” the human rights activist-chairman of local commission, then one of his opponents proved to be, in spite of the fact that in May 2013 the federal Public Chamber excluded it for the unethical behavior.
The lists of Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshev considers “vengeance for Kopeysk”.
The disclosures of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not influence ONK of Mordovia, which considers it “power”: one human rights activist wanted to fall only in the new composition, and in it even did not accept documents for the competition.
The member of advice OP of Nikolai Svanidze described to RBC [RosBusinessConsulting] daily that he voted against the list proposed, since it agitates situation in Moscow and to Rostov-on-Don.
It sent its position to other Council members out.
Its colleague on OP Pavel Gusev says that it voted after, since it pleases Moscow the list proposed.
Coordinated the composition of lists ONK the Under Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also the colleague of the Research Institute of the FSIN [Federal Penitentiary Service].
Fungus described to RBC [RosBusinessConsulting] daily that it does not consider it correct to divide candidates into the human rights activists and power figures and it is not agreeable with the fact that in Commission Chairmen it is sufficient authorities in order to prevent the work of its terms.
Fungus does not undertake to predict the vote totals of council pub.
If the list proposed will be today rejected, for the voting they will within the next few days carry out the changed version.

In 2011 the company of Google proposed for the patents of Nortel initial price in $900 million.
Google several times increased the proposed price, having in the final analysis proposed entire $4.4 billions.
After losing the matter about the patents of Nortel to the consortium of Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billions, in this transaction the library of the patents of the company of Motorola was partially the determining factor.
“In spite of the unsuccessful attempt to acquire at the auction the patents, which are the object of action, Google destroyed and it continues to disrupt them”, it is said in the legal action.

Penalties for the unsanctioned street trade in Vologda will grow

The majorities of street merchants do not pay taxes, production, which they realize, often does not pass the sootvestvuyushchiy sanitary control.
But this means that under the threat is placed the health of vologzhan.
Thus, the lower limit of penalty for the citizens for the unsanctioned trade since November will grow six - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the press service of the administration of Vologdy.
In September from the motor vehicle plant “Ford” in Vsevolozhske were discharged 600 people.

By worker, who solved on their own will to be discharged, were proposed “gold parachutes” in the size of several payments.
The overwhelming majority the jobs on their own will left because of this.
However, according to Etmanova, this quantity of people - this is entire night change.
I think, to this the matter will not limit.
However, authorities in the next two years do not plan to assume any programs of the support of provincial enterprises, which are located in the difficult position”, it explained, after adding that during the adoption of budget government does not consider the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In “Ford” this information they do not refute and do not confirm.
We wait answer from the company, and, as soon as it will appear, it let us necessarily publish.
Conversations about the reduction of workers at the plant “of Ford” in Vsevolozhske have long ago gone.
So, for example, about the plans of company to discharge 600 people began known still in September.
Previously plant declared about the stopping of the production of automobiles.

ANB blames “internal error”, but not hackers in the curtailment of the work of the site
That wrapped by secret the agency of national security stated on Friday in the evening that the curtailment of the work of their site on several hours caused the technical failure, but not hackers, as it was asserted in the network.
“NSA.gov was inaccessible for several hours this evening because of the internal error, which occurred during the planned renovation”, reported reconnaissance agency in the official electronic letter.
Problem will be solved this evening.
Statements, that the stoppage in the work was caused by the distributed attack of the type “failure in the maintenance” [DDoS], were incorrect.
The previously this evening online-systems of monitoring servers registered, that the site of ANB did not work at least six hours, and site is as before inaccessible for some users.
The previously representative of ANB reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of agency was " by no means " broken up.
No classified information is located in the danger, representative reported.
At least one online-group of hacker-activists stated that it bears responsibility for incapacitation of the site of ANB with the aid of the DDoS-attack.
DDoS-attacks are developed so as to whip purposeful site by traffic as long as servers do not occur overloaded and site does not go out of order.
The tactics of hackers is relatively simple, but attacks are not intended for the penetration into the internal network of purposeful system.
Previously super-secret ANB, which once received nickname “there is no such agency”, it proved to be in the recent months in the center of public attention and bitter criticism afterward the turns of revelations about its extensive programs of shadowing abroad, also, inside the country — all this is reaction to the secret files of ANB, stolen from the agency and published by the disappointed former colleague of ANB Edward Snouden.
The growing controversy around the agency caused senses about the fact that today's incident was the result of the goal-directed actions of hackers.
The head of Gazprom Aleksey Miller indicates that the conduit in Bulgaria signifies new era in the gas sphere
The beginning of the building of gas pipeline “southern flow” in Bulgaria signifies by itself starting of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom stated.
“Today occurred the sign event: began the building of the Bulgarian section of gas pipeline “southern flow”, the large-scalest and most important project in Europe”, said the chairman of Gazprom Aleksey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is the key element of energy safety of entire European continent.
“Southern flow” is intended for diversifying the export routes of Russia through Europe.
The dispute on the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which is located the large part intended gas of Russia of the intended for Europe, increases risk level for the usual routes, officials speak.
Miller stated that the direct connection with Bulgaria, member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks, connected with the transit countries, are removed “forever”.
Bulgarian users will obtain gas from “southern flow” on the decreased price, as soon as in 2015 entire project will begin to work.
Gazprom stated that the building must begin in other countries, located further along the route of gas pipeline, toward the end of the year.
Annual design pipeline flow efficiency is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Agency “Rosbalt” they deprived of status media outlet for the unquotable swearing
On October 31 Moscow City Court decreed to recognize as ineffective license about the registration of agency “Rosbalt”, writes “tape”.
On the deprivation of the agency of status media outlet insisted the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications - for the systematic and outrages about the media outlets.
In the course of the process the unpleasant precedent was created: court calculated by the possible to shut media outlets, having actually refused to publication in the right to advance counter-arguments.
That such “Rosbalt”
A privately held company “the information agency of Rosbalt” was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
During the subsequent years agency opened the second head office in Moscow and number of regional subdivisions.
Also in agency work representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001 “Rosbalt” was developed and functioned as federal information-analytical agency.
To the middle 2000-X the agency entered into the list the most learned particular Internet-media outlets in Russia.
With this “Rosbalt” it always filled the sufficiently specific niche: the nucleus of the exclusive publications of agency composed (they comprise, until now,) notes with the reference to the sources in the law-enforcement agencies.
Conversations about the proximity of publication to the primary structures continued for entire elongation of existence of agency.
Together with the fact that “Rosbalt” possessed the extensive base of sources in different departments, in favor of such assumptions spoke the fact that in the chapter of project it stood Natalie Chaplin - wife of Victor Cherkesova.
In this case the role of Chaplinoy in the leadership “of RosBalt” to the end is not clear: most frequently it is called “the leader of project”.
By the Director-General of agency is Larissa Afonina, editor in chief - Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently “Rosbalt” figured in the ratings of federal media outlets - neither on the citability nor on the audience.
In October agency occupied the 25th place in the rating of hit of sites Russian media outlets on the version of LiveInternet.
According to the data the same LiveInternet, the average-daily audience of site rosbalt.ru composes about 150,000 unique visitors (and to 500,000 it is review), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
In the number of most popular materials for the recent five months - note about the helplessness of the Kremlin in the relations with Ukraine, deaths of the soloist of group “king and chutes”, pogroms in capital Biryuleve.
The conflict “of RosBalt” with the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications began in July 2013, when they came into force of correction to the law against the media outlets, which forbade unquotable swearing, to journalists.
Department revealed the forbidden vocabulary in two published on the site of agency videotapes (“Djigit from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot they defiled petroleum towers”).
The future of side is described differently.
The Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications on the basis of discovered video materials accused “Rosbalt” of the gross and systematic disturbance of law about the media outlets and turned into the court with the requirement to select in the agency license.
In “RosBalt” they declared, that the claims of department were incorrect: first, rollers were not editorial materials, in the second place, maternye words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after warning rollers were removed from the site.
The representatives of agency appealed the claim of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications in the world court - and when on October 22, 2013 Moscow City Court accepted the action of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications, the examination of these complaints still continued.
However, already 25 numbers world judge made a decision not in favor of “RosBalt”: editor in chief Nikolai Ulyanov they recognized as the guilty of the disturbance of code about the administrative offenses and fined to 20,000 rubles - on 10,000 for each roller.
Obviously, this decided beforehand the outcome of hearing in Moscow City Court - if we forego ourselves the thought, that the outcome could be decided beforehand still earlier.
On October 31 court made the decision to recognize as ineffective evidence about the registration “of RosBalt”, having actually deprived the agency of status media outlet.
It cannot be said that “Rosbalt” in the course of this opposition remained in the solitude.
Agency supported Deputies of the Gosduma (statement to the name of the head of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications Alexander Zharova on October 10 they signed 26 deputies; document itself was given on the initiative of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation).
On the illegality of closing publication declared the head of the union of the journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Pavel Gusev and head of presidential Human Rights Council Mikhail Fedotov.
And what is more according to Bogdanov, the leadership of the Federal Supervision Agency for Information Technologies and Communications even granted to it some guarantees of the fact that the matter will not reach the opinion of license.
The court above “RosBalt” showed: under whose jurisdiction more safely to be found to the mass media in Russia today - a large question.
The gene of speech proved to be the stimulator of the formation of the synapses
Scientists from the university of John Khopkins and medical school of Mount Sinai revealed the protein, therefore “the gene of the speech” of Foxp2 achieves its function, stimulating the formation of the new connections between the neurons.
A study is published in Science, on the site of periodical it is possible to read its summary.
The gene of Foxp2 is first known the genome, whose function is directly connected with the speech.
To establish its role it was possible in 2001 because of the detection of family from several man, which could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even they themselves did not understand each other.
Scientists explained that in family members was disrupted the work of the gene of Foxp2; however, it fulfills its function how, it remained not known.
In a new study the biologists showed that at least the part of its functions of Foxp2 makes as the stimulator of the formation of new synapses in the region of the brain, speech connected with shaping.
Achieves this it because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for the factors, which stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 proved to be one of 10 similar genes, found by the authors, in this case only to its activity viyaet Foxp2.
That that SRPX2 actually influences vocalization, scientists confirmed in the experiment on the little mice.
When in animals the activity of gene was artificially lowered, they less shouted during the separation with the mother.
If the activity of gene was restored, was restored the frequency of the published sounds.
Earlier on the mice was also shown connection with the vocalization itself of Foxp2.
Animals, by which was introduced the human copy of gene, squeaked more actively, also, at the lower frequency than usual mice.
Until now, however, the scientists do not know, is connected the work of Foxp2 and, correspondingly, controlled by it SRPX2 with the purely “mechanical” properties of the formation of sounds or thinner processes.

You do want ice cream luminous in the darkness?
British owner created the first in the world luminous in the darkness ice cream with the aid of the jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of marine animal in order to develop the luminous food.
It arrived at this idea, after reading scientific article about the jellyfish, and it convinced scientists of China to chemically recreate the luminous protein.
Ice cream enters into reaction with the language of that, who eats it, increasing the level of pH in the protein and forcing him to shine.
Chris says that since ice cream begins to shine, when it reacts on heat- mouth, this means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of company for the production of ice cream “lick me, I tasty”, he says: “This is improbable thing, but still in the quite initial stage, if we speak about the production; therefore for £200 you will obtain about 2 g of substance”.
The protein, which we is utilized in the ice cream, enters into reaction with your language with neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms protein, this will promote of pH and ice cream will begin to shine.
We tested it in the course of several recent months, and it seemed that it will ideally present it into Khellouin, because it creates this remarkable luminous effect.
This, possibly, the most expensive ice cream from those that I made, because luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So that each ball costs me near £140.
Then it sufficiently pleasant to the taste.
The experimental company of Charlie, located in Bristol, is famous by its uncommon tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of tinsel gold.
But its following creation must prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: “I greatly want to develop invisible ice cream”.
This regarding is impossible because of the refraction, caused by the crystals of ice, of which the ice cream consists, but I think that we will find the method to make this.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by the Chinese scientists,

Italian workers with the period keep out of the way by the young
Italian unemployment breaks records.
Published data on Wednesday showed that without the work now 12.5% of inhabitants of the country.
So badly matters were not from the times of the Second World War.
Among the young this index higher several times.
40.4% of inhabitants at the age from 15 to 24 years do not have employment.
To the view of Italian authorities, one of the solutions of this problem - early output to the pension of elderly workers.
This ekperiment already carries out the most important energy company of the country, and the laws accepted make possible for regional authorities to ensure the part of the early pension for the workers with the period.
However, from the other side problem of the growing old population the general for Europe waits Italy.

Syria destroyed equipment for chemical weapons
Syria destroyed all declared power on the production of chemical weapon, organization for ban on chemical weapons recognized.
This first stage of disarmament completed Damascus in the day to the established period.
Until November 1 Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary units, intended for the preparation chemical agent for the application, transfers the BBC.
The destruction of very reserves of the toxic substances or their chemical constituents must be completed to the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of OZKHO, at present toxic substances are located in the sealed up depositories.
International inspectors left for Syria after in the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 in the course of gas attack they died, according to the data of the USA, is more than 1400 people.
The primary task of inspectors it was not to lose time - in order not to allow Syrian authorities to produce more than chemical weapons - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing of chemicals and equipment of ammunition.
Now they will attentively observe these production capacities in order not to allow their repairing.
The following landmark - middle of November: by this time OZKHO and Syrians must coordinate the detailed plan of the destruction of the already existing reserves of the toxic substances.
there are here many questions.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will grant for this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be checked thoroughly by Western intelligence services.
They with the willingness advise to inspectors new objects for the checking, if bases will suspect, that Damascus not to the end is frank.
The USA assumes that this firing was carried out by the regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist, that this affair of the hands of Syrian rebels.
The world community required of Syrian leadership - in accordance with the understanding, achieved with the mediation of Russia, to destroy or to put into the nonoperating state all power for the missile production, poison gases and liquids and for the filling of projectiles with these substances.
Now, when this stage is travelled, next step must become the destruction already chemical weapons of already available in the Syrian Army.
It is assumed that in this arsenal there can be more than 1000 tons of the neuroparalytic toxic substances, blister mustard gas and other forbidden chemical substances, which are stored in several ten different places.
For its destruction it is necessary that OZKHO and Syrian authorities for the beginning would agree on graph of actions - two weeks are removed to this.
The leader of field operations OZKHO Jerry Smith stated to the BBC that its inspectors “personally controlled the destruction of equipment”.
“They now do not have opportunity to conduct further production or mixing of chemical weapon”, he said.
In the statement OZKHO it is indicated that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced of the fact that the plants for the missile production and toxic substances either were destroyed or they were given unsuitable.
The remained two objects are too dangerous in order to conduct there inspection, it is spoken in the document, but equipment was from there transported and checked by specialists OZKHO.
According to Smith, the process of the destruction of infrastructure on the production of chemical weapons was “is especially complex”, since it was necessary to work under the conditions of the continuous conflict.
At the beginning of October OZKHO was obtained the Nobel Peace Prize; however, according to Smith, time to finish celebrating this in inspectors thus far it was not located - they were too occupied with work.
George Kerevan: gap with Europe gives the selection to Scotsmen
Already one day, one additional horror story about the independence.
They this time us warn that independent Scotland will have to be joined to the Pan-European zone of the free displacement as the condition of membership in the European Union.
The turn of histories about the passport control in Bervic and boundary with the barbed wire along Adrianov of shaft comes.
True, the newspaper of Strathclyde the possible economic benefits from the freer displacements over remaining Europe, although — what is predicted — this did not appear in the titles.
Anyone also the fact that the member nations the European Union spend much time on that in order to turn its formal rules in the manner that by them this is convenient.
Since Scotland now does not enter into Schengen zone, the continuation of the nonobservance of requirements will become cheap concession for Brussels instead of that, what he actually wanted from the Scotsmen.
So that this is not noteworthy history.
And such trying that it became the fossilization: for the first time I heard “duck” about the fact that “the independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
And nevertheless there is the interesting moment, lost with the retelling of ancient fairy tale.
Why generally independent Scotland must fulfill the orders of Europe?
Why to change the yoke of London by the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here are present the European news: great postwar plan to combine Europe at long last was stopped.
The project “Europe” is officially dead with evrokrizisom.
In entire European Union of the parties, which speak against the European Union or in favor of the cancellation of the Euro as common currency, is gathered the force.
Even in Germany the party of evroskeptikov “alternative for Germany” — based only in this year — appeared from it from anywhere and obtained almost five million voices on September federal elections, thus in the essence after extruding “free Democrats” (analog of our “Liberal Democrats”) from Bundestag.
There was always an internal opposition to the plan of the creation of federal Europe.
Nevertheless the current economic crisis became critical moment.
The measures of austerity, introduced by Berlin and European Central Bank, and fetters, superimposed to the national economies through the retention of common currency, led many people to the thought, that the project “Europe” visited too far.
The crisis of the Euro little is connected with the fact that the national governments work with the excessive budget deficits, this was correctly only for Greece.
In reality evrosistema blocked its members in the exchange rates, advantageous for the German exporters, that German politicians want to preserve.
Without the opportunity of the devaluation of national currency South Europe occurs in the previously unfavorable position on the production potentialities in the comparison with Germany.
Only rescue means — to reduce wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The deeper problem of the productive capacities of Europe costs after the current problems of budget and currency.
As a result of the package of measures for “green” energy, inculcated by Brussels, the cipher, which indicates subsidizing the French and German energy companies due to the user, European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for the gas, than in the USA.
These are paralizuyushche unfavorable price conditions, as we already saw in Greyndzhmute.
No wage freezes will in the world stop the crushing victory of cheap schistose gas of the USA above the European petrochemical industry.
As a result ripens riot, especially in France, once most ardent supporter of the European Union.
After war French political elite considered the European Union as the method to control Germany and to place Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as in the means of obtaining political legitimacy, and it already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, after leaving the destroyed economy of France in the miserable situation.
Result — the right-wing, speaking against the European Union party Marine Le Pen “National Front” recently won the decisive additional elections, after dropping the ruling party of socialists in the third place.
“Front” now is most popular party in France with 24 percentages of votes — timely warning to British laborists about the fact that it cannot be proceeded from the assumption that the division among the right automatically will be said in favor of the leftists.
What does make Le Pen with his novoobretennoy popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use elections in the European Union in the following year in order to create block in the European Parliament against the European Union and against the common currency.
If — and this very probably — the disposed against the European Union parties will obtain support on these elections, this block will be able to for the first time occupy dominant position in the European Parliament.
Here is my opinion: the soon growing moods against the European Union and against the common currency in Europe will merge together in order to destroy the Euro.
The European Union it will not disappear, but it will again become something like the diffuse “Europe (sovereign) nations”, which pleased General de Gollyu.
Germany several dependent on it economies can preserve the Euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Great Britain distances itself from this project, hoping to draw together with the USA.
Nevertheless the growing interest of Washington in Pacific Ocean indicates probability that Great Britain will remain without the attention in cold of the Atlantic.
In what position this does leave Scotland?
We can select to become the region (in the essence) of small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to chertyam.
I suspect, that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of the freer European understanding when we will preserve our currency.
Collaboration with other country-like-minded people will be more simply in nefederalnoy Europe nations.
It is otherwise for us worthwhile to examine the opportunity of repeating the experience of Norway and retention of our economic independence.
The government of Scottish national party in Scotland appears — however it is strange — by the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against the measures of austerity, which received impressive majority of votes in 2011 because of the objections against the spending cuts, proposed (and realized) by Labor Chancellor of the Exchequer by Alisterom by Darling and by emergent subsequently coalition of Tory and Liberal Democrats.
Of Scotland it would be now absurdly vote for the independence only in order to take the measures of austerity, imposed on Berlin and Brussels.

Early sexual ripening: aging is earlier
African-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries, show studies.
Physical changes do not mean that the sexual ripening is close
There is no evidence of the fact that the hormones or other chemical substances are guilty
Experts consider that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the starting gears of the early sexual ripening
Tendency toward early sexual maturity is not so expressed in the boys
Former correspondent of CNN Pet Eteridzh — journalist, who specializes in the children's health and questions of family.
One should mother be frightened, if in her daughter do begin to be formed the rudiments of mammary gland and grow pubic hair into 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics on this week into Orlando, state of Florida, children's endocrinologist doctor Pol Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are sufficiently extended among the American girls and are new standard.
“I conduct much time, calming down parents — usually this does not indicate the rapid offensive of complete sexual maturity”, said Kaplovitts.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair and smell of body, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only small displacement at the age to menarkhe (first menses) for a period of recent four decades.
In the United States middle age is 12.5 years and it was lowered in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast begins to be developed, passes at least two or three years to menarkhe”, said Kaplovitts, which is also been the author of the book “early sexual ripening in the girls: as to manage this extended problem”.
Time — most precise checking of that how sexual ripening will progress.
Is conducted the discussion, that is the actual offensive of sexual maturity, but it is considered as the “premature”, when an increase in the breast is accompanied by a sharp increase in the increase of up to 8 years.
In the majority of the cases the process will be slowed down or will pause itself — this that the pediatrician can track attentively.
More rapid progression can serve as base for the analyses in endocrinologist in order to exclude serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures in order to detain early menses and to avoid one additional consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which in the final analysis can lead to the retardation of increase and low increase at the ripe age.
Recommendations regarding medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of child, level of development, growth rates and emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplovitts is careful with the medicines, but it recognizes that “the suppression of sexual ripening can soften behavioral problems and sensations of girls, that they differ from contemporaries”.
Another big problem is intelligible: parents simply do not want so that their very young daughters had menses.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they will manage questions of hygiene”, said Kaplovitts.
“This was shock”, recalls one woman, in daughter of whom menses began into 10 years.
Although there were the signs and we spoke about menses, she was not emotionally finished.
It arrived home from the school by the frightened and detuned fact that it the first among its friends.
There are many widely proclaimed theories about the reasons for early sexual ripening.
Nevertheless there are no sequential proofs of the fact whatever that are guilty the hormones in the milk or other food, chemical substances in the environment or sexual promises in the mass media.
In boys — and in girls — sexual ripening begins earlier.
Kaplovitts asserts that the prerequisite, which has the greatest weight, this epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 it helped to conduct the study of girls from 6 to 9 years, which connects a quantity of fat in the organism with the periods of sexual ripening.
Others data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other facilitating factors.
In this country African-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach sexual maturity earlier than their white contemporaries.
There are different explanations.
In the entire world early sexual ripening, in all likelihood, influences everything: from the economic conditions and climate to the genes.
Another puzzle: although in boys the hair on face and on the pubes appear in the younger age, tendency toward the complete early sexual ripening is not so expressed as in girls.
Other doctors, who participate in the conference of AAP, confirmed the complexity of this theme.
The appearance of pimples and pubic hair is encountered even in babies and children of crib age.
“We must be careful relative to that how we determine the true offensive of sexual maturity”, said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, children's endocrinologist in the children's hospital of Gorieb into g. of Morristaun, state of New Jersey.
Parents must not be troubled to obtain indications from the pediatrician about how to speak to its child.
“This can indicate earlier than it was expected, conversation”, explained Kaplovitts.
If you preserve calmness, your child will, as a rule, react well.
To the girls, who bloom early, necessarily the confirmation of the fact that even when this occurs earlier than assumed, this process it is the normal part of the life.
To the head of Daghestan are heard in the hymn of Kubans the notes of the extremism
The football match between “Anzhi” and “Kuban” took the shape of a political collision between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Daghestan after fans they burnt Daghestan flag, and the hymn of Kubans began to sound differently.

This trader, Richard Asher, left from RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, to it was given vacation on his current post of the leader of European spotovykh currency tradings in JPMorgan.
Rokhan to Ramchandani, the leader of European spotovykh tradings in Citi, left into vacation on this week, while Mett Gardiner, the former elder currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was removed from the work by bank Standard Chartered on this week.
No one of these traders was accused of any disturbances.

UBS bank reported on this week that it took measures against some its colleagues after the Swiss regulator of Finma he said that it investigates the assumed manipulations on the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
The at least six controls in the world — the European Commission, Finma, antitrust organ of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice of the USA and the currency administration of Hong Kong — examine assertions about the fact that the bankers entered into the agreement for the action on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checkings or were obtained requests about the assignment to information from the side of controls, acquaintances with the situation of the person said.
Banks examine Instant Messages and electronic letters for several years in the search for the cases of offenses.
The news about the checkings stirred traders in the sphere of activity, which was being been in recent years one of the largest sources of income of the commercial subdivisions of investment banks, which in this year, however, encountered difficulties in view of the fact that the low volatility of currencies decreases favorable opportunities for the dealers.
Some bankers attempted to diminish seriousness of situation, indicating that by the extensive and high(ly)-ready currency market practically cannot be manipulated, but elder traders say that this is not always correct.
According to the elder trader, in spite of the enormous volume of daily tradings on the currency market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different commercial platforms and wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can begin to have an effect on market for the entirely small price”.
This news arrived during the same day, when Credit Suisse bank declared, that it discharged one of the traders of its division of the fund tradings of London exchange on this week, after that caused losses in the size of almost 6 million dollars at the end of last year.
Bank without delay informed the appropriate organs and he collaborates with his regulators.
“We are assured that the trader acted into the lone person and which this question was possible to localize”, reported Credit Suisse.

John Kerry says in his unprecedented acknowledgement that espionage by the USA “visited unsuitably far”
John Kerry demonstrated the softening of the tactics of the protection of the programs of tracking the USA, after making unprecedented acknowledgement, that in certain cases espionage by the USA “visited unsuitably far”.
The Secretary of State also recognized that it was guilty, together with Barack Obama, of the fact that it was “on the autopilot” during the appearance of loud disclosures of Edward Snouden about the espionage activity of ANB.
These information disclosures placed the U.S. Government in the center of diplomatic scandal with their allies.
Coming out on the video communication at the open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There are no doubts, that the President and I, and also other members of government in reality perceived some proceeding things on the autopilot, because this opportunity already existed — and during the Second World War, and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11”.

And the President is full of the determination to shed light to this question and to be explained before the people, and now is carried out thorough analysis so that not whom had the sensation of abuses.
I assure you, there are no abuses in the attitude of innocent people in this process”.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that ANB acted from the good motives and that its operations of tracking saved many lives.
It added: “We work in new peace, where the people are ready to explode themselves.
In the world there exists radical extremism, reckless and complete determination to kill people, to explode people and to attack the governments.

The news about the fact that ANB assembled millions of records of telephone conversations in Europe, worsened relations with some allies of the USA, although the head of agency stated on this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the incomprehension of meta data, which the NATO allies gathered and by which they shared with the USA.
In other disclosures were given promulgated Snoudenom the documents, which attest to the fact that ANB accomplished monitoring the cell phone of the chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, and also the telephones approximately 34 of other world leaders.

The names of other participating legislators must be supplied with sound within the next few days.
According to him, the program of trip still at the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of trip is the assistance to an improvement in the relations, he said that a certain degree “hardness from the best motives” will be also appeared.
He said that the European leaders must be honest with their people in what espionage programs they themselves used for many years.
“While we can change our programs of tracking so that it is better to protect the rights of Europeans, they also must agree with that fact that we not only, who deals with reconnaissance activity”, said Murphy.
Meanwhile Mr. Kerry must be directed to these output in the Near East and to Poland for the solution of the problems of hostility with respect to the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and also reconnaissance activity of the USA.

Khellouin of 2013 in the numbers
When I was small, Khellouin was magic.
Us with the sister they permitted there are candies, to til late not lie down to sleep and to arrange masquerade for our region.
Now I more greatly resemble the skinflint.
I was not volunteered in last two years to give out candies in my apartment and, most likely, not to camp and in this year.
However, statistics shows that I am white crow in the fact that Khellouina.
According to the information the national federation of retail trade, the majority of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate Khellouin in this year and will spend on the whole $6.9 billion on candies, suits and adornments.
Only, what I wait each Khellouin, this trends.
The national federation of retail trade forecasts, which to the suits will leave $1.2 billion of spent $6.9 billions.
In this year on the peak of mode the sexual inanimate objects.
To women no longer it is necessary to be the representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, for example by pizza, by hamburgers or morkovkami.
Concerning men, I think, we will see many zombie because of “walking corpses”, and I am assured that the cosmonauts in the style of the group of Daft Punk will fall into our tapes of Instagram in this year.
According to the communication to Google, the suits, which search for most frequently, this zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing poor in the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs up in the past year and, to my surprise, we were not only.
According to the national federation of retail trade, Americans will spend moreover, in this year $330 of million to the suits for the domestic animals.
This indicates many ridiculous dogs-khotdogov.
When the matter reaches the candies, we not melochimsya.
Americans will spend on them $1.9 billions in this year, according to the company of Nielsen.
This about 600 million pounds of shokoladok of Hershey, crystallized sucrose, candies of Milk Duds, masticatory candies of Twizzlers and bars of Clark Bar.
According to the information the Ministry of trade in the USA, these are the outstanding news for 41 million requiring candies children, who prepared to subjugate our regions.
Moreover, we will purchase AND-NOT will ourselves deceive — let us eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Khellouina.
Only, that we do not want to use, these are candies in the form of maize grains; and nevertheless, according to the national association of confectioners, their almost 35 million pounds are sold under Khellouin.
This approximately 9 billion separate maize grains.
This is the puzzle, which for me still one must guess.
Nothing so expresses the essence of Khellouina as houses with the ghosts.
They have the staggering names, for example “horror after the walls” (which, by the way, is located in the present prison), “howl and cry” and “the house of shock”.
And what is more, according to the information societies of America Haunts, in America are 1200 officially acknowledged houses with the ghosts, that generate about $500 million incomes, and also those staggering photographs, where you almost was described, which your friend laid out on Facebook, but you cannot remove, and then that fellow, who pleases you, it sees this photograph and leaves the commentary like “class expression of face”.
And in conclusion let us have a talk about the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the great pumpkin, when we were children, and cutting the lamp of Jack — this as adornment of Christmas tree, then that we make from the childhood.
Fortunately for us, mode to the child in the pumpkin began only in the past year because of Pinterest, so that majority of us grew, cutting out these pumpkins, but without sitting in them.
According to the communication to the bureaus of census of the population of the USA, in this year the Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The lamp of Jack, which slowly dries on your porch, probably, it arrived from the state of Illinois, which grew in this year 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you want task a little more complicated, you will visit Tim and Syuzen Metisdon in the city of Napa of the state of California and try to cut out anything from their pumpkin with weighing 2032 pounds.

The authorities of the USA described this tunnel by width four to three feet as one of the most complex secret motions, sometimes by them discovered.
This tunnel, whose zigzags compose the length of almost six football pour on, connects storages near the city of Tikhuany (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This region is filled with imperceptible storages, which facilitates the concealed loading of narcotics into the trucks.
Tunnel was closed, before through it were unnoticeably crossed any narcotics, as they stated authority.
According to judicial documents, the law enforcement officers confiscated eight and one-half of the tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine during the detection of tunnel.

“They sent their son into the school with the school bag, and him they returned by them in the bag for the corpses”, he said.

The MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department] described to reporters that the primary opening showed that Johnson died as a result of “position asphyxia”.
However, the second opening according to the MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department], it showed another cause of death.
“There are several questions, which should be solved or refined”, he said.
The MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department] added that if it reveals sufficiently evidence in order to require the criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, it will request the FBI to conduct it.
The representative for the administration for the sheriff of Loundiy region was not accessible for the commentary, when they turned on Thursday to it.

In the owners of pawnshops in Singapore of the matter they go well, while middle class experiences the difficulties
In the pawnshop in the shopping center of Bendemir in Singapore of Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga embeds gold bracelet, ring and links in order to pay school instruction in its daughter.
“My husband and I recently purchased house, so that all my money inserted there”, says Mrs. Amirtkhalinga.
Although it earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as the administrator and its husband also works, monthly family income it is not sufficient, she speaks.
Actually, demand in different parts of southeastern Asia —, where the volume of the debts of household economics grows — it is such, that ValueMax, where it carries out its transaction, on this week became the third pawnshop, registered on the Stock Market of Singapore.
Credit under the guarantee of jewelry articles — this is the not simply rapid method to obtain money (S$1300 Mrs. Amirtkhaling's in the case), but also almost so it is cheap as the unprovided bank credits.
Usually pawnshops in Singapore add to effective annual interest rate in 17% — scarcely higher 15.4%, proposed in the department United Overseas Bank, local creditor with the branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require checking solvency or proofs of wage and can issue credits more rapidly than banks.
Therefore millions of people in the entire region turn into the pawnshops, since the families feel pressure because of an increase in the cost of life and rapid growth in the debts of household economics and consumer debts.
After five years of the steady increase, which followed after the global financial crisis, and the cheap credits, which were being made up by free money and credit policy in the countries with the developed economy, the families with the low and average income level turn into the pawnshops in order to compensate the decrease of incomes in proportion to the retardation of an increase in their economies.
On this week of Standard & Poor ' s, rating agency, was indicated an increase in the family credit arm, in essence because of an increase in the mortgage, as the factor of risk for solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest relationship of the debt of household economics to the gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed this list with 80% of the GDP [Gross Domestic Product] in comparison with 60% in 2008.
Economists are also perturbed by the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which on this week hardly left the technical recession.
The data on Thursday showed the continuous reduction in the export and weakening consumer demand.
“They are in the fact that with an increase in the prices people in the middle and lower part [scale of incomes] will search for the methods to supplement their incomes, where only they will be able”, says Song Seng Vun, the economist of CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Record high prices of gold in last two years strengthened the hurry, with which the people embed their personal effect, since they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family adornments.
In Singapore about 70% of things, embedded in 200 pawnshop points of city-state, are gold articles.
People speak: “Price of gold appears grow prettier, give let us place the gold chain of grandmother we will obtain it conversely in the following month”.
In Thailand the largest operator of the pawnshops of EasyMoney observed an increase in the number of clients, who use its departments in the recent months, up to 20%.
Increase in the pawnshop business is such, that ValueMax, the operator of department in Bendemire and 15 others the same in Singapore, plans to be enlarged not only in adjacent Malaysia, where he has four stores, but also beyond the limits of Asia also, does speak Yeakh of Ching, the executive director of ValueMax.
Company will finance expansion, using 60 percent from S$66 of million, drawn on this week as a result of the arrangement of actions on the Stock Market of Singapore.
While some creditors caused the fire of criticism because of the high interest rates, Mrs. Yeakh says that the pawnshop not only proposes cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Clients embed the objects, which they already manage, and the monetization of personal assets does not increase the debts of household economics”, she says.
Pawning conquers ever wider public acceptance as the means for obtaining the short term, provided for financing.
And in this case pawnshops not only those categories of people, which are located in the difficult financial position, use.
The rich in Singapore also use departments of ValueMax, embedding gold ingots or hours of Rolex, which can give to 60 percent of their purchase cost available.
We see clients of all layers of society.
“They include the well-off persons, to which it is necessary to engage money for the short time for the commercial projects either investments or enterprise of the small business, to which it is necessary to overcome temporary money difficulties”, says Mrs. Yeakh.
Sometimes to them simply necessary money very rapidly.
Bashkirya can advance grain on the tradings not earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkirya in the course of state purchasing interventions can advance grain on the tradings not earlier than the beginning of 2014, the agriculture minister of republic Nikolai Kovalenko counts.
Today market prices are such, that they do not stimulate sale into the interventsionnyy fund.
Thus far price on the market above, and is demand.
“Possibly grain will be put out to the tradings, after New Year”, he stated at the yesterday's press conference.
Minister remembered that in the present year sowings of agricultural crops for the harvest of 2013 were 3.1 mln ha, including of the area of cereal crops - 1.7 mln ha, which to 3.3% is greater than in the past year.

Are increased areas under the winter wheat and tritikale, rye remained at the previous level.
In the Voronyezh province football fan, who broke window in the waiting room of the train station is detained,
Nine hundred in the evening on October 29 at the station the Mud-Voronezh colleagues of the transport police removed from the passenger train two football fans - the natives of Moscow region.
After leaving to the game of the dear command, fellows along the way arranged drunk uproar in the train.
They delivered young people into the alert unit of the linear police station at the station of mud for the composition of protocol about the administrative offense.
There fans repented in their anti-social behavior.
Policemen designed on them administrative material and let go.
Young people purchased tickets to the following train and on the train station of the station of steel to wait until its arrival.

To the ringing of the broken glass rushed the colleague of the transport police and guard the TAP “of RZhD (Russian Railways)”.
They succeeded in detaining criminal, who was attempting herself to disappear from the scene of crime.
By the colleagues southeastern Lu MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of Russia is carried out checking.
Rshaetsya a question about the criminal complaint, reported the senior reader of the direction of information and social bonds of southeastern Lu MVD (Ministry of Internal Affairs) of Russia in the field of transportation Sergey Olkhovik.
To Russian power figures nothing it is known about the group “fraternal circle” - new Proceedings
INTERFAX.RU with the reference to the informed source in the law-enforcement agencies RF writes about this.
“After in media outlets appeared communications about the introduction by the Board of Exchequer of the USA Lepsa in check list on the suspicion of membership in Eurasian criminal syndicate 'fraternal circle', we examined all databases, but such group they did not reveal”, said the collocutor of agency.
In his opinion, the propagation of this information contributes to the maintenance of myth about the so-called Russian Mafia, who allegedly acts abroad.
As they wrote earlier “NOT”, yesterday the Board of Exchequer of the USA published on its site the list of the assumed members of criminal group “fraternal circle”.
Among them was named Russian singer Grigori Leps.
It figures in the list as “Grisha”, they laid out the day before.
They coincide with the data of popular Russian executor.
Are indicated precise name - Grigori Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of generation.
Besides Lepsa, are there mentioned additional five men.
Two Russians, the citizen of Israel, the citizen of Uzbekistan and one additional descendant of the former USSR, whose citizenship it is not indicated.
IN the USA they are assured that Grigori Leps, who lives in the island It pkhuket it transported for the bandits of money on their order.
To this communication the photograph of singer is applied and are indicated all his data, which correspond to reality.
Moreover, Leps actually recently purchased house on You pkhukete.
In the department they noted that they were intended to introduce sanctions with respect to Lepsa.
The recording of man onto the black lists of American Minfin (Ministry of Finance) entails the blocking of its assets in the USA and prohibition to the business connections with it of those, who live in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa to the Mayas Serikova stated that no information to the singer it entered: “It is complicated to answer a question, that this Grigori, about whom everyone speaks now in connection with the scandal in the USA”.
Everything that knows Leps - this information media outlet.
Officially to it personally there were no information whatever, although I do not know, there are they in such cases.
“And, of course, this all, from one side, is ridiculous, and with another - it is amazing and unexpectedly”, she stated Russian International News Agency.
According to her, on You pkhukete Grigori Leps it does not live, but, as asserts Minfin (Ministry of Finance) of the USA, house in the Thailand island in it actually exists.
She stated that now Leps is located in prolonged stage through the Far East and Siberia, and that the news found it during the overflight into Blagoveshchenk city.
Black box in your machine?
The thus far American designers of roads attempt to find money to the repair of the scattered system of highways, many begin to see the solution in the small black box, accurately attached on the instrument panel of your automobile.
These devices, which track each passed by motorist mile and transmitting this information to officials, are in the center of a questionable at attempt the modernization of the obsolete system of financing the highways of America, undertaken by the planning agencies of Washington and state.
Usually the dull arena of planning highways unexpectedly gave birth to intensive debates and picturesque alliances.
Libertariantsy were joined to the ecological groups in the lobbying of assignment to the government of the right of the use of small boxes for the tracking of a quantity passed miles of passed by you and even, possibly, that, where you pass them, and the use then of this information with the composition of tax calculations.
Motion of tea drinking in the shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union also is deeply perturbed and raises number of questions relative to private life.
And although congress thus far cannot agree, continue or not, several states to wait are not assembled.
They reflect, as during the following decade it is possible to switch over to the system, with which the drivers pay for each mile of road, which they pass.
Thousands of motorists already took for testing these black boxes, part from which they have a function of satellite tracking.
This is actually necessary for our country.
“This is not that question, on which there can be the option”, said Khasan Ikhrata, the executive director of the association of the governments of South California, which prepares plans with respect to the beginning of tracking by state government of the miles, passed by each California motorist, by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technologies for this already exist.
The need for this is aggravated by the absence of means in the government fund for the building of highways, financed due to the taxes, which the Americans pay on the auto-servicing.
Americans no longer buy so much gasoline, as it is earlier.
Automobiles pass more than miles by one gallon.
Federal tax itself, 18.4 cents for the gallon, did not rise already 20 years.
Politics they do not want to increase tax even to one cent with the high prices of the gasoline.
“Tax to the gasoline simply cannot be preserved”, did say Mannich, expert on the transport policy at the university of Minnesota.
In its state it was recently established on the automobiles of 500 tracking devices for testing of the system of pomilnoy payment.
“This will be the best alternative in the long-term outlook”, he said.
Zanudy call this pomilnoy user pay.
It is not surprising that this idea draws urban liberals, since with the aid of the taxes it will be possible to change the nature of trips for reduction in the overloading of roads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
Planning agencies in California look at this system in the course of developing strategies for achievement of the purposeful indices, established by the ambitious laws of this state on the fight with the global warming.
However, the member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of the transport committee of chamber, said that he also examines this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The adherents of the free market in the fund “for Reason” also in the enthusiasm from the fact that they will force drivers to pay for each mile.
“This not is not simple the tax, which it will depart to the black hole”, said Adrian the MUR [Moscow Criminal Investigation Department], Vice President on political questions of Reason.
People directly pay for the fact that they obtain.
This motion is also supported by two former ministers of transportation of the USA, which in 2011 called congress to move in the direction of pomilnoy payment.
The senate of the USA affirmed in the past year pilot project with the cost of 90 million dollars, in which would participate of approximately 10 000 automobiles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators, who represent voters, which in the daily life it is frequently necessary to pass many miles in order to reach to the work or into the city.
Several states and cities, nevertheless, go along this way independently.
The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where for the participation in the largest experiment in the country are drawn 5000 drivers.
These drivers will soon pay state for the miles of path instead of the tax to the gasoline.
In Nevada pilot project is already completed.
In New York it is examined.
Illinois tests it on the limited basis with the participation of trucks.
But the coalition it is i-th-95, into which enter the transport departments of 17 states of East coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), he studies, as they can conduct these changes.
This concept did not obtain universal acclaim.
In Nevada, where about 50 automobiles of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were perturbed fact that the government can track each of their steps.
“Apprehension apropos of “big brother” and similar things is big problem”, said Alauddin the khan, who manages by questions of strategy and control of effectiveness in the department of the transport of the state of Nevada.
This was not that people wanted.
When dispatch tests full speed, the department of the American Civil Liberties Union in the state of Nevada warned on its Web site: “It is entirely simple it will be simple convert these devices into the instruments of full-scale tracking”.
There is no need for creating the enormous, bulky technological infrastructure, which it will be unavoidable to be enlarged for storing the records about the daily displacements of individual citizens.
Nevada - one of several states, where are conducted the difficult searches for inexpensive technology, which would allow state government of news the calculation passed miles of the passed by automobile, but without the information about the place and time.
If you are able to make this, the khan said, society will feel itself more quietly.
The searches for this technology brought some agencies of state to the small young company in California by the name of True Mileage.
Originally this company did not deal with assistance in the collection of the taxes of state.
It was attempted to leave for the developing market for the form of auto-insurance, with which the drivers pay on the basis of path.
But the devices, which it will test, draw the designers of roads, because they do not use GPS and allow the limited quantity of information, periodically loaded with the aid of the modem.
“People will be inclined are more to do this, if you do not track their speed and do not track their position”, said Ryan Morrison, the executive director of True Mileage.
There were several larger than errors in some of these pilot programs of state.
There are much the less expensive and less obsessive methods to make this.
In Oregon the designers experiment with the assignment to the drivers of diverse variants.
They can select device or without GPS.
Or they can entirely forego the device, after deciding instead of this to pay the fixed collection on the basis of the average number of miles, which pass all inhabitants of state.
In other places they hope to sell the idea of the alerted community, after forcing devices to make more, but not less.
In New York transport officials attempt themselves to develop the nalogooblagayushchee device, which will also assume payment for parkovochnym counters, allow “pay, as you drive” insurance and to gather the pool of the data about the speed in the regime of real time from other drivers, which the motorists could use in order to avoid plugs.
“Motorists will assign on the participation the benefit, which to them they will propose”, it is said in the document of city-planning design.
Some designers of transport systems, however, think about that, are not all conversations about the pomilnoy payment the simply enormous distracting factor.
In the urban transport commission in the region of San Francisco bay the officials say that the congress would can very simple to overcome bankruptcy of the confidence fund for the building of highways, after raising taxes to the gasoline.
It would be possible to collect additional one-time or annual tax from the drivers of the hybrid automobiles and other persons, whose vehicles much gasoline do not use, so that they would pay their fair share.
“There is no need for the radical surgical intervention, when everything that you should make, this to accept aspirin”, said Randy Rentshler, the director of commission for legislation and social relations.
If we make this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.
Pope Francois will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francois will elevate into the dignity of the new cardinals of Catholic Church for the first time in the period of his service on February 22, as declared on Thursday the Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after dad, and precisely they select dads, so that Francois will assign his first group of people, which will in the final analysis participate in the selection of its successor.
At present there are 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching by the cardinal of 80-year age it no longer can participate in the elections of dad — this is the prerogative of group 120 “of cardinal-voters”.
Declaring this news, the press-secretary of the Vatican the father of Federico to Lombardi said that before the ceremony of erection into the dignity will be carried out the meeting of all current cardinals, known as consistory.
“Pope Francois decided previously to report his solution to call consistory in February in order to facilitate planning other conferences with the participation of cardinals from the different corners of peace”, it said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the organization “Catholic voices” said that by February the number of cardinal-voters, probably, will be lowered.
He said that usually dad calls as many cardinals, as is necessary to again bring the number of cardinal-voters to 120, and also as many cardinals at the age it is older than 80 years, as it will wish.
Consistory in the following year will have great significance, because it will first be from the moment of Francois's election in March this year according to the Valeras.
At the given moment there is its kind a bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will interestingly look, will appoint new dad of cardinals from other regions of the world for restoring the balance”, he noted.
In South America they live forty percent of catholics, but they are represented by the negligible number of cardinals.
This will also be the first selected cardinals from the time of forming Francois the council of cardinals — group of eight cardinals from entire world, to which it is charged to search for the methods of reforming the church.
In the past dad solved everything independently.
“Now Francois selected eight cardinals so that they would help it”, said Valera.
He said that “it is completely possible” that Francois will turn to the cardinals for the council.
But we were not in this situation thus far — all this for us for the first time.
Valera said that dads usually raised into the post of the cardinal of bishops from the large arrivals, but Francois “was full of surprises — therefore we do not know, whom it will name”.

Tax for the foreign owners of real estate will lead to the fact that the London bubble will break
Treasury carried out the preliminary estimation of measure for tax to increase in capital, but it expects the final solution from Mr. Osborne, who in the budget of 2012 introduced the rate of the state duty in size of 7% for the houses with the cost of more than £2 of millions and yearly payments for the buyers, who decide to manage houses in the comradeship, but not as the physical persons.
At the given moment of gosposhlina to the home in the regions Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which was 708 million pounds in 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds sum total on North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and Khamberu together.
Mr. Cook stated: “After an increase in gosposhliny by the expensive houses and introduction connected legislation against the deviation of connected with this it is very difficult to assert that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated independent of the influence of that become obsolete municipal of tax system”.
“But this step can lead to the fact that some foreign investors will unwillingly buy real estate in London or its current owners they will not want it to sell”, it added.
The cost of first-class real estate — upper 5 10% of housing market on the price — in the rich southwest belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbleton, grew to record 11.8% in the past year.
According to a study of the company of Savills, price in the center of London they continued to demonstrate steady increase in size of 5.6% in the annual calculation, but them eclipsed actively developing “domestic market” with the splash of prices on the southwest, on north (7.4%) and to the east of (6.5%) city.
The current session of the association of the machine builders of Tyumen' Oblast took place on the base of Yalutorovskogo motor vehicle plant.
The presentation of new line for the production of electric welding pipes made of steel took place within the framework of the measure.
As described the commercial director of enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the advent of new owner is carried out a marketing study on the market exploration for the sale of steel constructions in Tyumen' Oblast.
It was explained that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electric welding pipes per month.
The solution about a change in the plant production structure and installation on it of equipment for their production was accepted after this.
Already in this year more than 7,000 tons of produced production are dispatched.
Investments into the plant comprised more than 120 million rubles, described Denis Gribanov.
Is in October neglected new camp, which makes it possible to increase assortment.
At the plant is produced as the small profile of pipe, which is used for the hot-house economy, the small forms of building and in the furniture industry, so also large - for the construction branch.
We plan to leave to the level of output of 50,000 tons of production per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in Tyumen' Oblast.
In spite of the passage to another form of activity, the number of colleagues in enterprise was not reduced - now it is 157 people, in the plans with the purchase of new equipment - an increase in the personnel is even more than by 50 workers.
The retraining of personnel goes in enterprise, and the necessary specialists are selected from already existing.
Is next year planned to introduce the new aggregate of the length cutting of steel with thickness to five millimeters, which will make it possible to reduce the prime cost of production, and also one additional camp, with a speed of the production of pipe of up to 47 meters per minute.
Toward the end of 2014 in enterprise they are going to master the production of the pipes, which are used in the housing and communal economy.
The management of enterprise poses the problem of shutting to 70 percent of the need of Tyumen' Oblast for this production.
The deputy director of the department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, turning to the leaders of productions, advised to pay larger attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
Toward this are directed the forms of state support to industry, which include the compensation of the interest rates on the credits to the purchase of new equipment and expenditures on its leasing.
In the present year for these purposes it is provided to allocate 150 million rubles, of this two thirds sums are already spent.
The last commission, which will examine the agreements of subsidizing, assumes documents from the enterprises until November 15.
In addition to this, by budget compensate the expenditures for the participation of local producers in the international fairs.
For next year budget provided means in the size of 150 million rubles, which can be used for compensating for leasing payments and credits for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be isolated into the participation in the fairs, 3 million - to the programs of energy conservation.
They are lowered to 72 million rubles in the means to the compensation of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of Tyumen' Oblast for the natural gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumova, over the long term this form of support will cease, since compensation for the tax to the extraction of minerals, which the oil companies paid out into the provincial budget, was the motive of its introduction.
At present they this do not make and subsidy become the straight expense obligations of region.
Taking into account this government of region priority considers direct support of industrial enterprises, but not financing through them petroleum branch.
The aid of budget will be connected with the investment projects, which will begin to be realized in the production.
Many leaders of enterprises expressed concern in connection with the arising situation in the relations with the oil-industry workers.
Grant to equipment the bought by them is the competitory advantage of the industry of the south of Tyumen' Oblast, and with its cancellation it will be difficult to compete on the price with the middle strip of Russia, where more cheap labor.
Furthermore, is not clear a question with the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - company “Rosneft”, which thus far does not place its orders at the Tyumen' enterprises.
Agreement on the realization of Uvatskogo project elapses in 2013, and claim its prolongation it did not enter.
At present the enterprises of the south of the regions, which specialize in the equipment for the natural gas sector, cannot form order book for next year.
A question remains open, will enter taxes from oil into the budget of region obtained in the Uvatskiy region or they will be paid out on the place for the registration of the new owner of layers.

Communication: the pre-election staff of Obama examined the exception of Biden in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to the communication to The New York Times, the nearest advisers of the President of Barack Obama secretly examined the opportunity of replacing the Vice President of Joe Biden by the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the selective list of 2012.
This discovery — the brightest sensation from by all the expected book of Mark Halperin and John Khaylemanna about the campaign of 2012 “rates are doubled: Game changed 2012”.
The publication of The Times obtained the copy of the prepared for the output book and it reported on Thursday in the evening that the close aides the President conducted “scale studies in the focus-groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” in order to estimate, can the exception of Biden help to raise the fading hopes for the re-election of Obama.
According to the communication of the political reviewer of The Times Jonathan Martin, the book gives the detailed description at of an attempt the high-ranking officials of the pre-election staff and White House, namely which was of the Head of Administration of the White House of Bill Daley, to estimate, what effect will show for the voting the designation of the former Secretary of State Clinton by Vice President.
Possible replacement was the secret, thoroughly guarded in the Chicago pre-election staff and in Oval Office.
Only six nearest advisers of the President — including Daley, who was the head of the pre-election staff of Obama to Jim Messina and the former senior advisers of the White House of David Axelrod and David Pluffa — knew that the replacement is examined.
The book “rates they are doubled” it asserts that Daley was the initiator of the attempt to replace Biden, in spite of them “close personal relations”, but in the final analysis it forewent this step, when their data showed that addition Clinton to the selective list not will " improve substantially Obama's chances”.
In the interview from Martin Daley it confirmed that the administration actually examined the opportunity of replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively spoke out for the examination of many things, and this was one of them”, said Daley to newspaper.
You must remember that at that moment the President was in the terrible form, so that we thought: “About God, that to us to make?”
Although Daley described a study as “necessary checking”, Martin described to the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the pre-election staff sufficiently much put in the study of that, will bring this step dividends during the voting.
“Pre-election staffs do not spend such amounts of money on the interrogations and focus-groups, if they do not examine something seriously”, said Martin in the program AK 360.
It is unclear, however, Obama did know that his command studied the opportunity of replacement.
Martin described to CNN that he asked Daley, its then boss did know about the possible shuffle.
Although Daley said that he does not think that the President “was up to date” possible replacement, that was Head of Administration it recognized that, “possibly”, Obama knew.
Martin added that “the rates were doubled” it does not give clear answer to a question, did reach the results of political sounding Obama's table.
Cooper did ask Martin, seriously he considers that Obama did not know about a study of the opportunity to exclude Biden from the selective list.
“Possibly”, answered Martin.
The head of the control--disciplinary committee of the RFS [Russian Football Union] Arthur Grigoryants reported that “the Kuban” was penalized to 500,000 rubles, transmits from the house of football correspondent “SE” Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions with respect to Krasnodar club are used for the arson of the flag of Daghestan by fans on the platform during the domestic match the 14th stage against “Anzhi”.
At the session there were representatives of both clubs, man from the RFPL (Russian Soccer Premier-League).
We investigated all available material.
For the nepravometnoe behavior of spectators “Kuban” it is penalized to 500,000 rubles.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less than the beer
The Russian brewers have poor mood.
On their estimations, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the previous level, and this at best.
Although the businessmen originally relied on increase.
Indeed current year is added for them unsuccessfully: sales fell by 7 percent.
About everything this it told chapter of one of the most important brewery companies of the country, the Chairman of the Soviet of Russian brewers Isaac Sheps on III of the annual conference of the institute of Adam Smith “goods of daily demand in Russia”, which recently was completed in Moscow.
On it they discussed the government control of market.
Since 2008 on 2012 the Russian market for beer has already been reduced by 18 percent, since in recent years in the country is observed the considerable strengthening of the regulation of the brewery branch in the part of production and revolution of beer - beverage with the small content of alcohol, it reported to the listeners of Sheps.
There is not in one country of world such hard constraint of the market for beer, unpredictable introduction newer and newer illogical prohibitions, which are based allegedly by fight with the abuse of alcohol.
Brewer complained, that many legislative prohibitions, called to reduce abuse level of alcohol, do not have a special effect, nevertheless constantly appear all new initiatives.
Sicker than all the producers of beer struck prohibition introduced from this year to sell alcoholic in the kiosks.
“We immediately lost 35,000 users”, said Isaac Sheps.
For next year in brewers two forecasts.
Optimistic - that, about which spoke Sheps: sales of foam beverage will be preserved at the previous level.
Pessimistic - they will fall by 2-3 more percent.
In order to preserve its they arrived, businessmen were forced to depart from the types, calculated for the mass user, to the class “premium”: beer it will become less, but it will cost more expensively.
Meanwhile radical consequences from a drop in sales with a small quantity of alcohol it is not thus far evident.
“According to my observations, the level of the diseases by alcoholism remains approximately at the same level, reported doctor-narcologist Aleksey Sotnikov.
True, grew the share of the sick, using substitutes strong beverages, and also those, who “took a seat” to the alcohol-containing toning up beverages like “the jaguar”, whereas ten years ago predominated precisely “beer” alcoholism.
To what will lead the building TPU in Moscow
With each year capital authorities promise to shape increasingly more transport-transfer units (TPU).
Until 2020. it is planned to introduce in build 255 TPU.
How in reality turns around project, our correspondent was investigated.
The pair of months ago in the metro “Smolensk” of Arbat-Pokrovskoy line arose construction fence.
Inscription said, that goes the construction of transport-transfer unit.
All this was very strangely, since no ground-based transport stops next to “the Smolensk” and cannot be, therefore, changed seats to it.
In order to reach the nearest trolley-bus stoppage on the Sadovoye Kol'tso [Moscow ringroad], it is necessary to overcome order 130 meters, including the ground-based passage through the Karmanitskiy alley.
Now almost everything is finished in “Smolensk”.
Flower stall disappeared, stand for the newspapers was dismantled, and asphalt before the entrance was changed into block.
Here and entire transport unit.
Transport-transfer units are planar and capital, they explain in the press service of the capital department of transport.
There are no capital TPU as yet.
But planar assume the building of parkings, conclusion of the commercial objects, which prevent the motion of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
Strictly, by planar TPU even are occupied not transport workers, but professional benefactors from the department of the innovation repair of Moscow city.
Transport unit - this is not necessary complex construction, explains the director of the institute of the economy of transport and transport policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
It is sometimes sufficient roof overhead and signal panel, which notify about the time of the arrival of transport.
Here, for example, in the metro “they ashen " recently opened completely valuable planar transfer unit.
Let without the sheds, but with intercepting parkings and signal panel, which indicate, when bus arrives.
But in pursuit of a quantity officials write in TPU everything that not after falling.
Still in 2011 city hall planned to construct to everything about all 151 unit, of them 59 with the capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020 are registered azh 255 TPU.
From them 150 promise to return even in this year.
Although in the city there is a development program TPU, not markedly any qualitative criteria, establishes Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of public organization “city and transport”.
They report in a quantity of objects, but the quality of transplantation for each of them frequently deteriorates.
Criteria, in the opinion of the expert, must be two: first - the decrease of the time of transplantation, secondly - convenience.
First of all the opportunity to replace the form of transport, without leaving under the rain.
However, in Moscow with the construction TPU it sometimes leaves exactly vice versa.
The clear example to the metro “of VDNKh (Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR)”.
Earlier suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came into the square before the main entrance in VVTS.
Now their stoppages transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavki to the street of cosmonauts.
It is further from the metro, it is considerably further from the monorail, then it is nearer to the apartment houses.
For free that inhabitants did not completely want auto depot under the windows and complained into all possible instances.
Somehow immediately it did not assign with capital TPU in Moscow.
The first of them they began to build years five back in the metro “glider”.
Project was called to become model.
And actually came out the model of that how the transfer unit, returned to the ransom to investors, it is converted into the commonplace shopping center.
No, here is platforms for the buses, shed, in order not to go from the metro in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
True, to the Khimki trolley buses of №202 and №203 in Moscow TPU place they did not give principally.
Them as strangers they moved aside further from the metro.
Then place under the trade greater it remained.
One clothing alone of 32 stores, and generally exist almost all - from zootovarov to the auto-salon.
Well in fact, suddenly by whom from the passengers of bus it will be necessary to purchase in the road new machine?
, When is built capital TPU, for some reason always is obtained shopping center.
Recently situation reached its logical completion, when they decided to return the part of the parking lot under the market.
Now on the third floor TPU “glider” among parkovochnykh places the marked on the gender goes brisk trade.
Vegetables, spice, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, maliciously casting looks to our photographer.
Transfer unit finally became market.
The fact is that earlier the metro “glider” had the market, but it they laid.
But in the prefecture of merchants they were sorry and released to intercepting parking of transfer unit.
Nevertheless there it is always empty because of the high prices.
However, ridiculous itself, that market they laid for this reason constructing at its place… for new planar TPU.
This here is castling.
In the metro “Kaluga” the distance of approach from the vestibule of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the building of shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
In order to sit down into the bus, it is necessary to traverse entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, it is necessary to go around it under the open sky.
However, constructions in “the glider” and “Kaluga” will soon seem flowers.
In the middle of September the city-planning-land commission of city hall affirmed the planning solutions for first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storeyed, without considering two-three underground tiers.
Main monster will grow in the metro “of Tushino”, in it there will be 418,700 sq. meters of area.
The representatives of the board of the railroad train stations of RZhD (Russian Railways), corresponding for the building TPU in the metro, already described to the journalists: in the future high-rises will be arranged the stores, hotels and apartments.
In this case the officials assure, that multistage parkings will be engaged from third to half of area.
Let us take for an example “people” garages.
Let us say, the garage to 258 parking places, which they recently built on the international street, has the area of 8015 sq. meters.
It means, for parking on 2,600 auto- in “the Petrovskiys-Razumovskoy” it will be required order 80,000 “of squares”.
This is less than third from that bulky object, which there they are going to construct.
Let one-two floors go to any platforms for the buses.
Remain as the minimum 150,000 sq. meters of commercial real estate.
But this, to minutochku, almost two GUMa.
If capital TPU in stations and train stations build railroad workers, then remaining areas will master metropolitenovtsy.
They also promised, that there will be many “objects of functional designation”, including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
By the way, in the department of property of Moscow city they recently told to journalists, that they work out the project of decision, according to which the investors can turn for obtaining of section for TPU to the officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore, it is said, that transport questions for the city - priority.
Ideal TPU - this, for example, “Harvard” station in Boston or “Spadayna” in Toronto, it is confident Alexander Morozov.
There trolley buses and streetcars get down under the earth to the level of the metro and distance of approach from the railroad car of the metro to the streetcar it is only 50 meters without the output to the street.
Around no extra trade.
But it throws Moscow officials into extremes.
Either nothing we will build or the already otgrokhaem of 25 floors with the offices and apartments.
Oil fell in the price to $96 per barrel.
Price of oil continued to fall and on Friday, when anxieties apropos of the formation of heavy stocks eclipsed by themselves the communication, which shows that the energy-consuming production sector of China gathers force.
The standard type of oil of the USA in the December delivery fell in price to 14 cents, and its price composed $96.24 per barrel to the late morning on the European time in the electronic tradings on the New York commodity exchange.
On Thursday contract fell in price to 39 cents, which in total composed a drop in the price in October of 5.8 percent.
Rich oil stockpiles influenced its cost in the recent weeks.
The Department of Energy on Wednesday stated that the reserves of the USA increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks the reserves were supplemented more than to 25 million barrels.
But on Friday appeared indication of a possible increase in the demand, judging by two communications about the Chinese industry, which demonstrated the splash of its activity.
This it indicates that the economic redevelopment of China can continue to gather force after the index of increase in the third quarter it rose to 7.8 percent after the twenty-year-old minimum in the previous block.
Oil of Brent — the standard type of international oil, utilized also by the oil-refining enterprises of the USA — fell in price to 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the intercontinental exchange in London.

Specialist emphasized that “for advance guard” it is necessary to pay the increased attention to game in the defense.
We looked video of match against the Magnitogorsk “metallurgist”, it gives the official site “of the advance guard” of the word of Chebaturkina.
- They passed many washers, not very pleasant moment.
They passed because of their errors, because of the nonfulfillment of play task.
We knew that the rival has executors.
According to the statistics they had five attacks on the move - three washers to us clogged.
Very good realization.
These errors were taken into account with the preparation for today's game?
We with the children thoroughly investigate each match, we talk after game, we are prepared for the new rival.
The main thing - so that the installation would be carried out.
All saw the first period of match against “the metallurgist”.
Play task was carried out, and calculation was 2:0.
They passed goal “into the cloakroom” - and in the third period they began to make mistakes.

All commands are located in the identical conditions.
Main thing now - the realization of its moments and the fulfillment of play target.
Hockey - this is emotional game, if you perform installation - everything is solved not then complicatedly.
The profit of Bombardier is reduced with a drop in deliveries and quantity of orders for the aircraft
The corporation of Bombardier, Canadian producer of aircraft and trains, reported on Thursday about the reduction of the clean profit by 15 percent under the action of the decreased quantity of orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and of problems with the contracts in its railroad subdivision.
Company of Bombardier the located in Montreal also did not publish no data on the flight tests of its newest aircraft of CSeries and granted to new information about that, will be executed ambitious plans with respect to the introduction of aircraft into the commercial operation towards following September.
After the first flight of the prototype of the air vessel, which was being taken place about one-and-a-half months ago, it flew only three times, which raises questions about that, the stage of tests according to graph does go.
Results did not justify forecasts and led to a drop in the actions more than on 8 percent on the Stock Market of Toronto.
Cameron Doerksen, the analyst of National Bank Financial, decreased on Thursday his estimation s “higher than srednerynochnogo” to “the srednerynochnogo” because of the persuasion, that an increase in the actions was limited into the near block or two.
“Although reduction in the quantity of deliveries of airships was as a whole predicted, we are undoubtedly disappointed by the indices of the profit of transport division”, said Doerksen in the survey of the stock market.
We believe that Bombardier will obtain new orders on CSeries in proportion to the continuation of flight test program.
Nevertheless, if in the next months it will not be declared about the new orders, we assume that the market will begin more skeptically to relate to the program.
The company of Bombardier hopes that the family of the aircraft of CSeries will allow it to conquer place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus now prevail.
The first prototype of air vessel was represented in March and it the first time completed flight in September after several months of delay.
However, solid orders on CSeries there are thus far too many — 177, since the potential buyers wait flight-test results in order to verify the assertions of company about the fuel effectiveness and potential efficiency of new liner.
In all now are 403 orders and understandings with 15 clients and operators.
Chief executive officer Pierre Boduan was confident, that Bombardier will achieve its goal into 300 solid orders up to the moment, when the first aircraft is neglected in the commercial operation.
On Thursday leaders also certified analysts and media outlet, that the program advances according to the plan.
“Test model airplane did not remain on the earth longer than it was expected”, said Boduan during the phone conference, after adding that to the dead time of aircraft were planned the ground tests and software updates.
All producers plan tests differently.
We decided to conduct the first flight and to make interruption to the renovations, so we entered.
So it will occur during the entire flight test program.
The second of five test models must complete flight in the next weeks and everything else soon they will follow it, as company reported.
And nevertheless analysts skeptically relate to the statement, that the first client will be able to approach the operation of the aircraft of CSeries 12 months after his first flight.
The company of Bombardier stated that it evaluates the period of the putting into commission and will grant new information into next few months.
“This slow rate of flight tests - although, in all likelihood, and corresponds to the internal graph of Bombardier - it supports our point of view, that the putting into commission will be postponed by the first quarter of 2015”, said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, which was finished on September 30, net income of Bombardier were reduced to $147 million, either 8 cents per share, with $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the past year.
The corrected profit to the action remained before — 9 cents.
The gross income was reduced insignificantly — from $4.2 to $4.1 billions.
Analysts expected the profit of 10 cents to the action and gross income of $4.56 billions, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world in the value producer of aircraft reported that he placed 45 airships for the block, what is less than the index in the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The book of orders of aerospace division composed $32.9 billions on September 30, without having changed since December 31.
“In the aerospace region results corresponded to our purposes; however, a small quantity of the orders entering and general market conditions became unpleasant factor”, said Boduan.
The gross income in the aerospace direction fell by 13 percent — to $2 billion.
To Bombardier, the most important in the world producer of trains, reported that the gross income in this sector grew almost by 11 percent — to $2.1 billions.
Order book in the transport subdivision composed $32.6 billions on September 30, which is somewhat higher than the index dated December 31.
The problems with the performance of several large contracts negatively affected the incomes of transport subdivision.
Management stated that in the fourth quarter the new plan of development will be represented.
The actions of the company of Bombardier, which also declared, that the main financial director of the corporation of Google Patrick Pichett will participate in board of directors, they fell by 8.5 percent — to S$4,83 on the tradings in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company of Embraer SA, the third in the world in the value the commercial producer of aircraft and the nearest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday about the decrease of quarterly income by 10 percent.

Thorium - new hope of nuclear power?
Governments in the countries of entire world continue to think above the fact how to provide energy needs.
The combustion of the hydrocarbons (, where they there is) negatively influences climate.
The renewed energy sources require large areas for the generation.
Atomic energetika manages without that, etc, but leaves after itself the mass expensive withdrawals of expensive in the utilization.
Scientists recently focused attention on thorium - one additional radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is encountered around the world, and, as specialists assert, its splitting does not leave the withdrawals, which must be stored by centuries.

Two colleagues of YMCA are accused of the sexual crimes up to the charges against Jonathan Lorda, as the known royal commission became
Two colleagues of YMCA NSW were accused of the sexual crimes against the children before the advancement of charges in 2011 against the worker of establishment for child care in Jonathan Lorda's Karingbakhe, they reported to royal commission for sexual violence against children.
But in the opening statement of commission it was said, that it “never dealt concerning the cases of sexual violence against children inside its organization”.
Chief executive officer Philip Kheyra they asked about one case, when the worker of YMCA was accused of the crimes, connected with child pornography, and about other case, when the instructor of gymnasium in YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned for the sexual crimes against the children, who were being found under its care, in 1991.
Mr. Kheyr said Gail Ferness, to attorney, who renders aid of commission, that he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second.
It recognized that YMCA in the opening speech for the commission also allowed inaccuracy, asserting that “there were the external checkings of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA is located in the first rows through providing of safety of children”.
Evidence the presented to commission speak, that YMCA was informed, that it obtained the second from the end from four possible estimations according to the results of Audit the quality, executed by the department of formation and associations in August of this year.
Mr. Kheyr, who entered in YMCA, when to it there were 21 year, it recognized that it and the subordinate management allowed oversight, after hiring lord, and could also not ensure the clear understanding by personnel of its obligations, which are concerned communication about the disturbances of the security policy of children.
Earlier in this year lord was condemned for the sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years of its work in YMCA.
It was concluded in the prison as the minimum to six years.
But Mr. Kheyr rejected assumption about the fact that the corporate ethics of YMCA prevented colleagues from reporting about the disturbances of lord in the sphere of safety of children.
Colleagues gave indications, that they observed disturbances, including that the lord was located in private with the children, personally it handled them, it planted them to himself to its knees, he indicated that it loves one of them it made possible for them to play by its cell phone.
Daniel Okvell, which was found under the leadership of lord and requested to train to its protection of children, because it was perturbed by his behavior, it testified that found Jackie Barnat, manager on the guardianship above the children of the department of YMCA in Karingbakhe, which was the leader of lord, “very frightening and frequently almost inaccessible”.
Executive director said that it does not assume the explanation of colleagues about that which it was uncomfortable to report about the situation to its higher leaders.
It is faster, according to him, their friendship with the lord took away them from the thought about the need for reporting it
Mr. Kheyr said that he introduced to the council YMCA of new southern Wales his opinion about the fact that the lesson for the organization from “the incident with Jonathan Lordom” not “concerns assignment to information” from the side of colleagues, and council agreed with it.
Mr. Kheyr stated that the solution to force colleagues to sign agreements about privacy after the appearance of charges was soon accepted by the Director-General of YMCA on the guardianship above the children Liamom Wheatley.
He said that this was called avoid the spoiling of proofs, but in this case “they overdid it” and they badly realized this solution.
YMCA new southern Wales was not safe for the children organization during the work in it of Jonathan Lorda in the period 2009-2011, reported the Committee of Experts on the problems of the seduction of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith's university.
He said that there were “the serious problems” with the collection, selection, instructing, instruction of personnel and control of it.

Screening by Guillaume to Niklu of the novel of Diderot's Deni can brag of exceptional setting and historical details, but it also more heavily is received than must it would be.
The film, whose action occurs in France 1760-X of years, tells the gloomy history of Susannah, young aristokratki, sent for the monastery by its family.
When it begins to rebel, it experiences extreme cruelty from the hands of sadistki-nastoyatelnitsy and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
Film never descends to the banality or sensation — and in this entire problem.
Because of its serious solemnity the narration risks to become testing like the hair shirt and for the audience.

Ben Grinmen: Tenth anniversary of the New York comic festival: New-Yorker
It is possible to boldly assert that New York — this is the place of the generation of stendap-comedy in America: almost one hundred years ago variety artist Frank Fey, who worked by master of ceremonies in the theater of Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in the conversational manner.
The innovation of Feya in the course of time caught others, very recently - New York comic festival.
Created and treated Kerolayn Hersh, by the founder of the stendap-club of Carolines, festival celebrates in this year his tenth anniversary, counting more than sixty shows in the small clubs and Bolshoi theater.
“The majority of these khedlaynerov began in Carolines, and they then achieved larger success, reached the level, when they are already too famous in order to come out in the club”, she said Hersh.
We created this festival as the method to continue work with them.
In this year measure includes the appearances Wanda Sikes, To keti Griffin and Bill Fog, and also “Stendap for the heroes” — yearly musical comedy charitable concert for the military veterans into the Madison-square-garden, where will appear among other Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosbi.
With the expansion of festival was enlarged peace of comedy.
Several comedians, who participate in the festival in this year, acquired popularity nontraditionally, for example because of the show on the small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Drooped Kroll it obtained reputation because of the role in the comic series on the little-known cable television channel (deliberately salacious “league” on FXX on the theme of fentezi-football), and now conducts its own sketch-show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleyt entered into the actor's composition both in “Saturday evening live” and into “the parks and zones of leisure”, although most of all she was known on a series of virus rollers “Marseille - cockleshell in the boots”.
Both Kroll and Sleyt as other young comedians with the original style (syurrealistichno pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, sly, focused on the racial thematics Kamau Bell), this is the result of decentralized peace of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of festival it will become the interviews of David Steinberg with Larry David.
Steinberg began as stendap-comedian, but he then became successful director on the television and in the cinema, and also by the unofficial historian of comedy.
Since 2005 on 2007 it was the leading show on TV Land by the name of Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
Meeting takes place in the hall of Town Hall in the center of the Manhattan.
“This city — unconditionally, the central element of the entire work of Larry”, said Steinberg.
It described to me that arriving here, it sometimes goes for a walk on any to the by-street between two houses and thinks: “Here if I will remain entirely without the money, possibly, I will live here”.
