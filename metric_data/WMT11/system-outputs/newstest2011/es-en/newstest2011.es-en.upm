What it has? The SSD in Prague not known or to Voldemort or the pastry
The new Councillors of SSD in the capital going to have to overcome, allegedly, barriers apparent to the components of the Board of Prague and the Council municipal understand to their renewed colleagues of ODS.
The period Aktualn. cz "considered" to the members of the new Council of SSD to verify their knowledge of language marked slang that has arisen in recent years in the Council, when ruled Prague the current members of the coalition.
The slovar prav cheloveka Dictionary encoded which used the flower and cream policy of Prague during the previous period, of more Pavel Bem, includes some of the characters, situations and causes more known of the metropolis.
Amazingly, has been proved that the new Councillors almost not include those known concepts.
At least, that they do.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I do not know."
"Rather I am a rookie in the political Prague," stated during the consideration of terminology of "colegueo" the councilor of culture Lukaš Kaucký.
And as regards veteran political, respond as Karel Bezin.
Perhaps know the concept "hole of golf."
"Possibly be the sole expression of all I you asked that use of time when."
"If not, not normally employment slang."
The glossary, whose definitions published a newspaper Aktualn. cz last June by the congress of vote of ODS, the drafting chose six examples, in particular those that are particularly relating to municipal authorities in Prague.
The Socialists have to explain the concepts "Voldemort," "greater hole of golf of Prague," "go to the pastry," "nape of bull," "betrayal of the capital" and "shield."
Three Councillors accepted submit to the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, that in future will be responsible for education in Prague, the principle agreed, but not returned catch the telephone.
The fifth councilor, Petr Dolinek, refused directly to do so.
"I do not I methodological in these things and I am assessing how it fun the civic Democrats."
Yes I "what matters is how we understand in the implementation of our programmes," noted.
As has been, allegedly the councilor Lukaš Kaucký it would have realised that the title before it is an expression of a influential employer and a friend of Former Mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
To Kaucký the floor "Voldemort" it is not said anything; the only end to hit in the review is "the hole of golf largest of Prague."
"It is of the tunnel Blanka," said Kaucký, be added immediately: "But rather I know from the news."
"I am going to have to suggest a way of languages," jokes.
Karel Bezin is not the only one that recognizes in the hole golf of the tunnel Blanka, but also the councilor Environment Lukaš Plachy.
After, both sociodemocratas know who is really Voldemort and Lukaš Plachy even know where to find that character; in addition, must realise the significance of "go to the pastry."
"I believe that it wants to go to a company from Prague"; will soon be reveals to Plachy that it is the seat of the enterprises of Janousek.
As Bezin, indicates that such knowledge was of the news, but not used as vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, between the sociodemocratas there is no glossary so family in terms colloquial.
"Asked to my colleagues, but really think that we do not have anything else."
"Rather, between us use Nicknames, sometimes Abbreviations or do games of words with the names," said the President of SSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"In the school I called Biza, but I do not know if my colleagues too I call it," confesses its own nickname Karel Bezin.
The newspaper Aktualn. cz piloted the name and works.
For their party colleagues, Weinert is Dda (similar to "yayo") or, least friendly, Ddek ("old"), the Representative Miroslav Poche, with the associated themselves before the elections cheating during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname of "Igraek" ("playmobil") on the part of some of their colleagues.
The Nicknames are also the only expressions that the sociodemocratas tolerate in the talks within the party.
To Hulinský do not like that is call Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualn. cz found even other Nicknames to the President Prague.
"The doctor of the rights of the cheers" allegedly recalls that Petr Hulinský obtained their PhD in law in the police academy in Bratislava.
The Government wants to restrict torture of the "witches," according to published a brochure
Women viewed as witches in Burkina Faso shared certain characteristics.
They often have an older, may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are single and do not have children.
Women who are "getting" witches are sent to an isolated area, for not impair the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer such but."
"Nor is isolates to young women healthy, because help in the work and have children," sets a nun that, in the capital of the state of West Africa Burkina Faso was concerned in a special residence for more than 100 women evicted from their communities.
The local Government has decided to oppose this unusual "measure social."
Issued an information leaflet which should help to avoid the Hunting of witches.
However, this is a snag.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know read," cautions the newspaper Die Standard on the disadvantages of awarenessraising in writing.
Allegations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Win, neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, the week died Ammy Hemmah, of 72 years, when three women and two men the tortured, the covered of Gasoline and the burned.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors say that was due to a unfortunate cumulus circumstances.
According to their version, women are lit in the olive oil is used for the unctions rituals.
It lit in flames when the group wanted "removing the poor spirits" of women.
The isolation of the "witches" the support people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted in an employer of 42 years of Burkina Faso: "The Eaters of human souls always represented a threat," stated.
While in Burkina Faso the Government tries appease the Hunting of witches, in The Gambia the past year has participated in it the President.
"The Gambian president Jammeh, following the death of their Aunt, launched a comprehensive Hunting of the witches that, alleged, had been related to his death and had attempted to kill own president through the magic slick."
"To aid brought to Shaman of the close Guinea which, protected by police officers, military and the escort staff of the President, were to force men and women chosen randomly between peoples Gambian to the ownership of the Chairperson in Kanilai," notes in his report the organization Amnesty International.
In the farm, persons arrested given that drink a potion of herbs with effects Hallucinogens that, in addition, are provoked problems intestinal and renal.
Two of those arrested but it was the while in the farm.
After international pressure, finally released to around 1 billion people detained.
The tenant of Bakala: it heated with stoves of coal and signing a rental highest
The man, elderly and loud, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the client of the company RPG Byty of "magnate coal" Zdeek Bakala, the largest private owner of Flats in rent in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm was some documents with the new contracts for rental of three Flats: its own, the her daughter and of his are, to serving sentence.
The three are just pillage the liberalisation of the rent charges.
Instead of 3.500 crowns Czech the month, the child will pay beginning of next year 4.100 crowns by one but two stays with Kitchen separate second category.
"In addition, not available water hot and the heat is based on a boiler of solid fuel," shows with the finger the man in the new contract of his are, on whose signature is full powers.
"But it signed," explains the angry, the resigned.
The partnership BytyOKD civil. cz, that called new conditions of rental and "incorrect and indecent," recommends to the Renters not sign the new contracts and we expect to December 7th, date on which published a guide report on how to proceed in such cases.
But, to this, the man alone is a gesture.
"Everyone says one thing," said with bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a laboratory of evidence of the liberalisation.
After New Year will happen with the vast majority of the Flats that, in the Czech Republic, were to come under a rental regulated.
That is why, Aktualn. cz it was decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The meeting room of expected mining of RPG is one of the four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday to the nine, was already full.
Exactly along the way are the security guards and your side an item for catch number.
"Rental 2011," can read in a button light of their screen Touch.
The press, emerges of the item a slip with a number.
Nearly there is no time or to read "57" and the number already appears in the large screen strong position in the highest in the room.
In a second, ye in the tail.
Shortly after, is a marriage elderly to ask, but the crowd of the Chamber is not here for the new rent charges.
The majority of people coming to solve problems common, as formerly: applications of arrangements, issues of safe and similar matters.
The letters with the new contracts of rental will in Ostrava to the Mailbox of the Renters of the majority of the 44.000 Flats belonging to RPG around the middle of November.
RPG Byty are proposed in the letters an increase of rental of between 15 and 38 per.
On 18 November it opens a window particular at the centre of attention to the client to the new rent charges.
"Operating a week, so that is beginning," respond, doubt after briefly, workers who are in it when the customer is presented as a journalist.
The liberalisation and the old Flats to miners of Bakala are the most delicate issues in the area.
Before the elections, already discussed the loud and clear the VicePresident of Parliament, originating in Ostrava, Lubomir Zaoralek, of SSD, and now appear consistently in newspapers in the area.
"Twenty years later I would like a soil new."
"And I changed the damn point of bathing," it vent the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, for the time comes from more than anything pensioners to see if they receive a Discount in the rental if sign a time, and promises the special offer of RPG.
They also receive half of Discount on the rental of February the remaining Renters that sign the new contract by December 15th.
However, the window of the "liberalisation" mining certainly not achieved dispel the avalanche of doubts.
"Of the 360 clients who were here yesterday, only asked for the rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people," estimated the used of the window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposed in the website and in their boards to individual meetings on contracts where necessary.
If the two parties do not reach agreement on the rental, should address the issue an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but of information on the only way to proceed as possible and fully in line with the law," has been RPG in its page.
"Here is not going to judge anyone," view one of the employment of RPG Byty and a man who is in the street address at the centre of attention to the client is given, at least in part, the reason.
"Receive a pension of 13.000 and I are 5,000 to the food; i have no means to resort to courts," states.
But, immediately, the used planting the question.
"We shall see."
"Mr. Zaoralek they Alerts in the media which does not sign, so that people may wait," believes.
The regulation of rent will be in the majority of the Czech Republic to formation of 2011 and, according RPG Byty, its enlargement is an economic necessity.
"The current rent charges not yet filled even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the merits of the community," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the portfolio residential of the company RPG Byty, that adds that the neglected state of the merits of the community that angry to the Renters is, for owners, the main reason for increasing the rental.
Whereas during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rent charges invest in flats four billion, in the four years that iran of 2011 to 2014 the figure will rise to 5.200 million.
The large screen that hangs of the ceiling, address the seats of the Chamber of expected, now have some data that highlight in red.
"The increase of rent in the year 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 31.200 flats, is to say, over 90 per cent of the property of RPG."
"In addition, will always be a maximum 7,50 crowns Czech monthly by metro square," indicated in the screen.
Only 38 an increase in the rental of 400 Flats of the portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it is an increase from a few sums extremely low, of 19,66 crowns by metro square," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 Flats, the rent will remain constant next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation does not affect of blow to the rent charges, but that it scaled between four to eight years.
In addition, adds the following compromise: the company it will invest all the money of the rise of rental (be consulted the figure) again in the Flats, mainly in savings in heat: new windows and heat.
They will have priority those that sign the agreement of higher rental.
The architects have understood that the offices also need childcare
The building administrative Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one would say that hide also in its internal a small childcare with all the same to such facilities: walls of colors, furniture creative and even a park in thumbnail in the terrace foreign.
Since October last year, can resort to her children of employees of Arch. Design.
The company of projects architectural Arch. Design, of whose study took many buildings known in Brno, thought since the first sketches of building Avriopoint to include a space for their miniguarderia.
In the company work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom and wanted allow the architects and draughtsmen might return soon to work after maternity.
Together with the opportunity to have a few hours, the childcare is one of the benefits offered Arch. Design their workers in the framework of its programme social.
The construction and architects thus have the possibility of combining a profession demanding with the care of children.
The miniguarderia was an idea of the own employees of Arch. Designu and, with the support of the direction, achieved obtain financing of the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The miniguarderia of the company is funded through the European Social Fund in the framework of the Programme assessment of human resources and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding delivered (a contribution of more than $2.8 million crowns Czech) could purchase the equipment and, after two years, engage qualified staff and services.
When exhausted the financing (two years), the company Arch. Design has the obligation to maintain operational the miniguarderia with their own funds for three years.
The preparation of project lasted a year and in the submission of the request for funding contributed the company Economy Rating.
The attention of the child is in the hands of qualified personnel; in addition, are present throughout the day for their care a nurse and a Professor of the Ministry of Education. The childcare currently caters to children without age limit, although the majority of them are less than three years.
Given that this is a "miniguarderia," only can host simultaneously to a maximum of five children, although with the employees look more during the day.
The functioning of the childcare is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the childcare, irrespective of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is a care education and individual, the content of the agenda of the miniguarderia are comparable to the programme of preschool education especially.
In her children not only play, but also receive a quality education: since the basic learning to the preparation for school, taught to English.
The class not only provides for toys and games of table, but also of a computer for children.
The presence of small children in their own business to create an environment friendly and positive.
Parents can go to see to their children at any time and avoid the stress of collecting late to the children of school when it is far from their place of work.
This, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this ends of natural way a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch. Design lies between companies sign that offers a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support to the family and, in conclusion, this programme strengthened marketing of staff.
The home of the bones is fascinating following 100 years. Watch the interior of Gaudi
The camp to the back a lizard prehistoric, the stairs remember to the column a dinosaur and the balconies seem the discussing a fish open.
That is the House Batllo, in Barcelona, of architect Catalan Antoni Gaudi.
Owing to its way similar to a skeleton, premises the nicknamed "the home of the bones."
Its forms organic, their colors striking, the use new of the litmus, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that reminded the scales and the ubiquitous lines gently curved, all this is a typical of secession of Antoni Gaudi.
The cover page of the House plays with lines dream, colors sensitive and textures taken of the nature and fauna.
Giving more attention, there is a certain geometry, rate and a carefully the intended.
On the night, all the façade of the home it seems even more staggering, because that is lit of this way to improve the brightness of the colors.
Winds and the torque of the ways we still surprising also in its internal.
The wood wavy copy the frameworks of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the peepholes and the signs.
The House Batllo, that it is in the neighborhood of Eixample in the number 43 of the animated street trade Passeig of Gracia, was born of the remodeling of a house of the year 1877 of architect Emilio Room Cortes.
The reconstruction it lasted two years and the home was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the rich industrial Josep Batllo, initially stressed reason the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudi make a reconstruction new and cheaper.
However, the House Batllo, formed by various flats, not the designed Antoni Gaudi only.
Cooperated in the design the architect Josep Mary Jujol.
In fact, in their levels of project emerged ornaments for the apartment representative of the master of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the façade also workers other Creators and artists.
Cooperation in the proposals of the House Batllo was the beginning of the fruitful collaboration of Jujol with Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House Mila and the park Güell of Gaudi, in which there are other pieces the same.
Owing to its forms functional, the local shortly after the end the nicknamed "the home of the bones."
Other, due to specific mechanism opening of the windows began to call "the home of the yawns."
Also states that, in the high construction, is the sword of San Jorge, pattern of Catalonia.
Other elements sculpture of the construction hide religious reasons.
Gaudi projected in the home a single system for the time of heat central to vents of ventilation and the fireplaces typical.
Can be strange its tilt of 40 and grades five.
During the construction, Gaudi not respected in all the rules of construction of time and has not ceased influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the permission subject since the beginning, although obviously in it the above data on the reconstruction planned were so vague that, two years after, to its finalization, the city??council it was so impacted with the result that requested to amend it.
It is bothered, for example, that the construction included Columns even the sidewalk public.
The arrangements ever been undertaken, quite the contrary: only fifteen days after the request of city??council, Josep Batllo (requested and obtained) permission to rent the two Flats highest of building.
In the Flats under this installed its own owner.
In the Gallery but the second was the games and in the third but the bedroom and the private apartment of.
The plant low it rented to a Jewelry.
The home, of six Flats, is completely crossed for a steps that leads to the terrace of camp.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all angles and lines Straight, blanketing of walls curved.
Gaudi worked also with the modern concept of connectedness of space.
The party that it can reconnect fully opening the doors of the Banquet and a group more we can communicate in this way without problems, without that will relinquish privacy necessary for discussions more intimate.
The home, with the reconstruction of Gaudi, not only was a new façade, but also a camp unusual and Flats two additional.
It is impressive also how Gaudi play in the light, tiles targets and blue be filled on patio internal and skylights.
The issue with the two colors provides the maximum of light in all the Flats of the home.
It is based simply on the principle that the target reflects more light that the colors dark, which on the contrary absorb the rays of sun.
Any person may visit the House Batllo, that in the year 2005 was added to the list of world heritage of mankind of the Unesco.
In the first but the home is the apartment spacious more and more recharged of the available to the public.
The directors decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, with occasion of 150th anniversary of the birth of famous operator.
With the visit confirmed, or found, that it is a very profitable business and expanded visits to the common area and to the attic, including the terrace of camp.
The price of entry to monument is not insignificant, reaches the 16,50 EUR, although the students, the pensioners and the heads of the cards tourist obtained a 20 per cent of Discount.
The amount exceeds considerably the price of the entry of other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you are the real environment of the bed with their towers of lizard, should be a friend rapidly to a resident of the neighbouring houses and visit him at home.
How is choose the mattress and the mattress: women and men seeking different things
Nothing of a framework pompous for the bed; what really allows its quality at a good bed is the area to lie down, is to say, the mattress and the mattress.
Above all must be complemented to perfection to adapt to the specific users.
During the election come into play many elements, including the weight, up, state of health and sex of the master.
It is also important the type of interior in which it places the mattress and the mattress.
A typical example?
For example, in a hut of weekend not generally take heat, should not be used Mattresses of latex because it "hot" more slowly.
In addition, often though considerably more than the Mattresses of polyurethane usual.
Therefore, it must give the round more frequently.
If there is no aerate duly the channels of centre and, above, are on a firm basis, maintain within the humidity. Even can appear mold below.
At the time to choose a bed, also influence customs.
Who has spent much time abroad, often used mattress a very high with a layer soft and will have problems to feel good in an area lower and tough.
"Almost all the players from hockey that returned the NHL it complained that there sleeping equally well."
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips needed Mattresses with a layer soft of viscoelastic."
"This type of Mattresses it also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the system nerve, so that they receive bad information of the joints and the high," explained Sylva Hadamczikova, that it specializes in the furniture padding.
Many players from hockey, like other clients, take time preferring the Mattresses of viscoelastic.
"Today there is no problem, because they have adequate Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also marks the Czech Tropico."
There is no longer be a player of the NHL in order to assess the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" is a very simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and forms depending on the heat absorbed or is adapted to their heat body.
Nothing put pressure; during the night, not be twists and turns and after a hard party.
Simply, it sleep better.
The viscoelastic also works as protection against the sores.
To choose the size of mattress, add to their equal length of their feet, is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a rise of approximately 180 cm require a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a room double, of 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of the individual rooms, for example single, it is recommended as a minimum between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit also be agreeable.
"If not, we can implement a simple rule for assessing the wide: to lie down discussing above, should have the power comfortably shrunken towards the elbows," advised the engineer Helena Prokopov, expert of Cechu alounik to dekorater, that for many years remain seized of the problem of sleep healthy and the ergonomics of furniture, subject which taught in schools specialized.
In the rooms double, each one needs its own mattress and mattress, so that for the purchase we must pay attention to combine the task of the Mattresses.
Otherwise, will be necessary mount the bedsteads to different stage, which is not always possible in all the beds.
The Mattresses of Foam should take up a minimum of 14 cm, models with internal spring a minimum of 15 cm, of whom at least three cm are for the layer to be adapted to the ways and softens.
"To touch with the power or at accommodate in the mattress, certainly should not noted the spring," cautions Helena Prokopov.
Each mattress requires a kind of mattress determined.
The bedroom fully padded, in which the mattress and the basis are as Siamese, have no sense in the bedroom.
The Mattresses breathe poor and cannot be wash its based, which today is often.
And, given that every night perspire between 0,2 and 0,75 l of sweat, is clear that after some five or seven years the mattress will start to remind to a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, specialists reject the slogans to speak of a life of mattress of up to 25 years or, even, a guarantee for life.
However, all is one but.
That is why, the sellers are a council: in the Mattresses with a wide of 120 or 140 cm, get busy carefully the cleanup and the washing of the based, but better add a protector of mattress that can be withdrawn and wash likely.
Although it is currently being produced founded on Mattresses with closure of zip in all its perimeter, so that the open stay in two parts (something very important for the washing and the size of the washing machine!), its use in the models bigger (and by a single person) to break the mattress may seem a fight between a weight fly and a weight heavy.
In the bed, in lieu of a mattress, is a table strong?
Ever!
As much for the beds thought to pass a night visits.
However, must do (if not the have already) holes of ventilation in the table and must be used with a mattress with spring in the interior and meet a minimum of 15 cm with the spring in pockets (as the German Taschenfederkern) and a layer soft.
The Mattresses of polyurethane should not be used on such foundations.
For the bedsteads of Print not articulable and that containing between 14 and 18 Print, can be used Mattresses of latex or Mattresses sandwich (for example, a combination of latex and fiber of coconut), although it is always best a mattress with a greater number of Print, 28 or more, in which the Print of the area lumbar are strengthened and it can regulate their rigidity.
The bedsteads of Print articulable should not be used with a mattress of spring, since no reacts to the resting.
In addition the adjustment of the rigidity of the Print, can be used also the protection of shoulders.
It is a special inclusion of the Print that allows press or, even, tilt the Print of such way that "surrounding" perfectly to the shoulders for the dream.
For men who have a very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
Even this agree of these manufacturers of Mattresses that, in the "male," began to use a nuclearweaponfree soft more precisely about the shoulders.
It also agree of women, for whom also an area more soft on the hips.
For clients more demanding, there bedsteads with structure in cross or tablets with the socalled damping multitorsion.
The pressure distributed among various points and it reduction the tension.
It should bear in mind also that, although used the mattress and mattress appropriate, if used a bad pillow (large and "fluffy"), will disappear the majority of the benefits.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow must sustain the head and the corners can only get to the shoulders, for which it can relax the muscles the same.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 cm x 60, quite normal for example in Scandinavia.
The lie down of hand, the pillow must be at the same level (when combined with the mattress to strengthening for shoulders or area more soft of mattress) that the task of the shoulders.
The Mattresses modern have something to do, allegedly, with the Mattresses original fillings of straw.
Manufacturers are using, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, are out of fashion the Mattresses biological.
Raw materials for basis of oil, with those who are manufactures the Foam of polyurethane, it filled oils with natural, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all manufacturers known used soybean.
"Biological, in the case of the Mattresses, means that the centre is made only of material of natural origin," explained Petr Vašiek of the company Tropico Plus.
It also, natural substances are used for preparing the based on the Mattresses, one of the first aloe vera.
But it may elect to the microcapsules, that release an aroma fresh a forest or lavender.
There are also differences in men and women.
While men are "cool" with extracts plant of breeze, to the based mattress of absorb the heat and cool the body, women prefer "heat" the based.
The extract of pepper red improving the movement of blood, so that women feel more warmth.
The Favorites currently?
The Mattresses made of Foam cold, that are more porous, with a structure of stem adapted, which is to be more permeable that the polyurethane normal and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of Foam cold and viscoelastic allow manufacturing Mattresses in various areas as you know very well where is the head, the shoulders and the heels.
A mattress of good quality it will cost of seven thousand crowns to above.
Those who play a role therapeutic may have a lower VAT, because it considered as health and.
The first met with this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is complicated savings in the Mattresses and bedsteads.
Sometimes it can approve the offers of manufacturers or sellers, that at times are two Mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the CE Magniflex provides Mattresses Duofreeze with a Foam with memory Memory attached to the based on 11.990 crowns.
The second is achieved free.
The was of the viscoelastic with a structure cell open and a great density was initiated with the material "cosmic" of Tempur.
Initially arose as a material for the NASA, because during the takeoffs loas astronauts it saw subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur it softens with the heat and hardens with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exercises an effect perfect and adapted optimally its pressure.
Therefore, is ideal to avoid that occur sores, but also to improve the comfort for the dream.
The Foam viscoelastic not only be used in the Mattresses, but also for health products, for example for pillows to be placed under the legs and the relief, as well as their movement.
Manufacturers national, for example, use the Foam Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar.
Increasingly parents use mechanisms for followup of people to control their children
The fear for children is becoming more people to think in control them for GPS.
The system, initially intended for the followup of vehicles, can also continue the movement of people and contribute, for example, in case as the end of the girl child of nine years Anika Janatkova.
At the moment the decision is the size close of a box of matches, but soon it would reduce the size of the clock.
To many people fear it was the case of the missing Anika and started to report on the means available for better protection to their children.
Even at the expense of invade their privacy.
"We are all trying you say that it is not spy, but other means to reduce the possibilities of triggering a tragedy," considered Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of mechanisms for followup in the Czech market.
"Recognise that, in certain cases, can be abused for such mechanisms, for example if it put in the bag someone without their knowledge, but we do not have encountered with such cases."
"The majority of customers really do buy for reasons of security," adds Pilin.
In his view, children should always know to what is the "small box" and how it is used in case of emergency.
The psychologist child Dana Bokova has been on the fact that, if the child does not want this, simply the pull.
"Even smaller children show great creativity at the time to lose intentionally certain things if they want to avoid that they control."
"Before, parents trust dramatically in the mobile, but these it could off as likely as the system of followup," states Bokova.
In his view, is debatable if in case of attack this system is genuinely useful.
"If it is an abduction prepared, the perpetrator almost always shall assess whether the child for some kind of electronic system that can reveal its location."
"Now is the telephone."
"As would be to extend the use of the mechanisms for monitoring, also the search, since their out without doubt will be much publicity.."
"In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police," said the psychologist.
However, added that such mechanisms can help in the case of an attack ad hoc a pedophile.
According to Robert ech of the company RC Monitoring, that offer aftercare services both for vehicles and for people, even in case of, after an attack, it destroy immediately the system of followup, its presence can help.
"It can shape the decision to send regularly the position after a certain period."
"If suffers damage, at least facilitate the final position of the person in question."
"The mechanisms more expensive have integrated a meter of tilt, so that if the person is merely sliding and it is still, the decision will give just a warning to the position in question," states ech.
In his view, a service of this kind can obtained even with the mobile telephone intelligent with navigation, in which only must installed a special software.
The problem of the units of followup today is that at the moment it is basis with a similar size in a box of matches or the mobile phones of smaller.
Therefore, can be lost.
According Pilin of Macro Weil, for that reason we are carrying out tests at present with mechanisms that appear clock a digital.
"In addition, will have the advantage Added that a possible aggressor may not identify the decision."
"Or that they identify after some time, which can make the police win time," adds.
Although the basis of followup is carried in the wrist or hanging, continue to be using the same technology is used for the followup of vehicles.
It is the check of the position with a system GPS (to be used in the navigation especially in the car) combined with the role of a mobile phone that said the current position.
The army has sufficient wicks as to surround all Czech Republic. But only last two years
The army Czech bought 445 kilometres of wick to catch Remnants.
Since the last year the Ministry of Defence added to its array 224 kilometres of wick.
Therefore, have inventory to 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four to the keen.
The army bought the wick for Remnants the STV Group, to. s. by 40 million crowns.
The staff of the SecretaryGeneral responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of a number of such enormous wick saying that the soldiers need for the delaying of training 60 kilometres of wick the year.
According to the calculations of the pyrotechnic of military, with those which was in contact MF DNES, it is decided however that, in this case, should carry out these delaying with frequent use of Remnants each year also all the general, official high command, and even secretaries and cleaning.
Do not want exempt or the Minister of Defence Alexandr Vondra and the Captain of military Vlastimil Picek.
Only thus could be justified that the army spend 60 kilometres of wick.
Such length equivalent to 25 000 explosions.
Although this was, the army would have adequate inventory for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as they say experts, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would with the new procurement (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) adequate inventory for the 225 also cited above.
The soldiers of the brigade of rapid intervention is complained personally recently to the Minister Vondra because they say that hardly have ammunition for various arms, for what is limited even practices of shot on the question of money.
And not let us talk about the lack of internal Clothing.
"I nor achievement understand that we buy repeatedly such amounts of wick."
"But it is their decision and, without doubt, you will be aware why act so."
"For us, the army is a good customer to that, as company, we are trying to meet," admitted the director trade STV Group, Jan Dcký.
The spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of wick also saying that will take inventory of this "ammunition" at least for ten years.
However, Jan Dcký, of STV Group, indicates that the wick only has a life of four years and, in the case of products pyrotechnic for the army or police, of two years.
"If it stores in a perfect conditions, can last up to four," said one of the soldiers who, for the possible criticism of the army, not want to give their behalf.
After the end of their life, each ammunition must checked carefully to see whether continues to be reliable and not hurt to the soldiers.
But these tests are not Free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, to buy 445 kilometres of wick, was a Discount.
"We cost 60% less than the request of last year of 244 kilometres," indicates the spokesperson Pejšek the centre of purchase of the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wick of the pyrotechnic of the police, to eliminate ammunition of the Second World War or the left by the Soviet army, there is already over recent years the 1.5 meters.
In addition, the police always asked only the quantity just as to exhaust ammunition before the end their life.
We decided for reasons of security for the pyrotechnic and, in addition, meanwhile it can achieve types of wick more modern and reliable.
The Ministry has already clear difficulties in conclusion tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition of the time of the Covenant of Warsaw, when the army Czechoslovak of hundred thousand people preparation for a campaign in the Rin.
According to the pyrotechnic with those who spoke MF DNES, after a couple of years will be the following problem with the current: will to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of wick old, that it is buying now "cheap."
Until now I still live in the contacts that got thanks to participation
The fact of winning the participation "Employer of the year" helped to Lukaš Pytloun in the out of the Franchise of their hotel.
On the latest edition, won the participation "Employer of the year" the entrepreneur of 28 years Lukaš Pytloun of Liberec.
Its success story it seems taken of a film.
To Lukaš Pytloun is loved travel.

The most convenient for all was, until recently, the hotel design of four stars Pytloun.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.

To my successor wish you a further year tranquil of which we have had in FARMET
The euphoria by the victory will soon be dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the victor, is possible that FARMET had already passed the worst.
The master of the company FARMET, Karel Zarsky, received the first prize in the latest edition of the participation of Vodafone "Company of the year," the past year in the "House Slavic" of Prague.
The jury assessed their efforts, with those who achieved make a small technical workshop in eska Skalice in a signature with a volume of business of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize not only to me I felt encouraged after, but to all my staff and improve our confidence to combat the competence," said the winner of the past year.
The history of the company FARMET begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the State proposed to the father of Karel Zarsky the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the But of property during the Communism, did not hesitate for too; renounced its seat in the company in that worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with their father of batteries of plastic.
Shortly after, began to specialize in presses of oil plant.
Eight years later became the largest manufacturer of presses automatic of the centre of Europe.
Gained a greater presence also among the public no specialized in achieving success in the participation in the media.
"Not only our clients began to consider the CE FARMET as considerably better, but also the foreign partners began to assess cooperation with a company that obtained a greater success in your country," said Karel Zarsky.
Last year perhaps it was not in FARMET just a sample of the euphoria of the victory.
Was also recognition for trade performance until the year 2008 and, partially in keeping, of 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the year more hard for the out of machinery.
The deterioration of the crisis, not yet been achieved in many citizens, led to the enterprises stop their investment projects and would begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"Us, clearly, either we rid of this situation."
"Income is reduced to 40 per cent, necessary to limit the production and even had some dismissals," explained Karel Zarsky.
A company viable must, in times, take action even some people.
However, monitor the situation and maintained the profits of enterprise, although outside to levels lower than before the crisis.
Despite all, where FARMET not cut expenditure was in research and development.
"With subsidies have built a centre for research and training, reinforce the presence in the international market and obtained magnificent reviews Fairs in national," said Zarsky.
Everything indicates that have already made the crisis behind.
The income go back to increase and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expect to provide a sense of victory, but in a calm atmosphere more," notes Karel Zarsky.
A survey that reveals the rules ridiculous
The survey of Absurdity year' part by fourth time of business tournament.
It has already been removed some rules ridiculous.
The winner unknown to the new edition of the survey Absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access in line.
The decision adopted more than one third of the almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security requested by a extract of commercial register, while its staff can obtain it with two movements of mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of the social security no longer asked a extract of recording business when take control of the impositions of insured," declared the spokesperson of SSZ Jana Buraova.
The objective of the survey Absurdity of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that must be respected by companies and employers in Czech Republic and try to be those that are absurd.
This year is the fourth time the part of the tournament business of the publication Hospodaske noviny and begins to create hobby also among the public.
While the edition of last year saw the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, because we still have legal obligations a number of surplus that must be respected just to trade.
"Perhaps in the number of roles necessary for the statement of taxes we first global," comments Karel Havliek of the Association of small and mediumsized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of rules business is a declared goal of all Governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to be a company, Czech Republic lies in the position 74th, is to say, eight posts worse than the past year.
The participation Absurdity of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and every year we have the same way.
Anyone can indicate any absurdity administrative or bureaucratic each year between April and the end of September, when it is the participation.
The proposals can be carried out in the website www. firmaroku. cz. After, the organizer of participation choose to seven candidates for the "spoof" and, during October, enable the public vote on the Internet through www. firmaroku. cz/absurdita and www. ihned. cz.
Won the absurdity received more votes.
For the survey of this year was submitted more than one hundred, in particular 105 rules and regulations that have no sense.
The examples the sent both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "Finalists" of participation is stood, for example, the requirement that the vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or employers with 20 employees, two offices and two baths paint every two years the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals of this year is published in the pages of participation.
The announcement of the participation, that is always made to beginning of November in the place of Wenceslao of Prague, form part of an event in which tend to participate personalities of the world political and social.
This year, for example, attended the event of participation Eva Svobodova, the director of the Association of small and mediumsized enterprises and entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State is consistently puts obstacles to the entrepreneurs, that is why my aim is to eliminate every year at least thirty above that currently complicate unnecessarily trade," announced the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate the regulations absurd not stay in water of Borage.
In the year 2007, what more bothered to the people was the obligation of the employer to communicate with a time of three days in office the business of the area of operation permanent, intend to go to a post at a Fair or exposure.
This obligation is eliminated in the new law industrial.
The obligation to over secondly number of votes in 2007, is to say, the communication to the office of the work on the part of its foreign workers to travel to work up to 30 days, been eliminated in the law of the socalled green card.
And the third is the expired.
The Absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the Physiotherapists to its consultation a mirror, a fridge and two scales of soil.
That is why, this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that it had eliminated the obligation to provide a fridge.
A new category recognized as socially responsible companies
We appreciate the environmental projects, humanitarian, educational or sporting.
The novelty in the fifth edition of the participation of Hospodaske noviny is the category socalled Company responsible for the year 2010.
The purpose of this participation is to support companies responsible and fair.
"In this way we want to support enterprises dealing with the impact of its activity on the environment and to supporting activities socially responsible," said Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of participation, as in the case of participation of Rebel of the year.
For this new subcategory of the special edition of this year the main participation of Vodafone Company of the year 2010 is presented enterprises for whom the commercial success is not the only longterm objective.
The history of each of them is inspirational and would allow us to write a separate article.
Although the type of activity varies completely between one and other, the common denominator is the support and the consideration that offers.
In a case, it is for example the disabled, in other problems or personal health of employees.
Among the fourteen Finalists throughout the Republic is stood, for example, the company Prague of software Et Neter, that supports the training of equipment games informal among its workers, that after participate in Tournaments of various Sports.
Another example of company responsible for the area of Pardubice is the company Isolit -Bravo, already been seven years remains the main contributor of funds to sponsor children with disabilities.
In Podbros, there is a stationery that is particularly concerned about the problems of health of their workers, because they constitute more than 70 per cent of the staffing; that is why was the title of Company responsible for the area of central Czech Republic and participation in the Vodafone Company of the year over thirdly in the region.
In Olomouc won the company of accounting MiRyz Soft, that reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours Weekly, without reducing wages.
The title is also the granted because the purchase priority to manufacturers Czech, supports the Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We are trying recycling the maximum possible to our activities of production and administration if the minor impact possible in the environment," explains the business Miluše Ryznarova.
The responsible committees IT Enlogit of the region of Usti also intends in the health of their employees and, with each Notebook, are offered a chair and keyboards ergonomic; in addition, supports the work from home and in their business events used the services of catering of a company protected local.
"In addition, we support the scholarship Person in need, that assistance in particular the Rome community local," comments the representative of the company Ondej Suchý.
It also put in place with a good mention the company of Laundry PRANI to ištni of the region of Karlovy Vary, whose employees receive subsidies a special way to have an impact on their pension fund.
"Us give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," said Josef Strap, of the company of construction of Bruntal Czasch, Winning in the region of Moravia -Silesia.
In the category of Company responsible for the year focal point had been designated automatically to all the regional Finalists of participation Vodafone Company of the year that responded to questions of form of registration and the sent by August 15th to the organisers.
The organisers eliminated of the evaluation the Forms that were not complete or erroneous.
"If the representatives of companies Contestants not responded questions, could not participate in the participation of Company responsible for the year, but there are disqualified of participation" main "Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual candidates for this participation this kind are no longer allowed, because it is a subcategory participation of main Company of the year," explained Karel Goldman of the advice Bison & Rose.
The police carried out arrests during a public auction in the building of the Fund Agricultural, in Pilsen
The police against corruption conducted several arrests in the building of the Fund Agricultural in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed to a local employer sector the media and the employer real estate Luboš G.
According to, this attempt manipulation a public auction under way to restitution of the rights of such way that the ground auctioned the would receive a detainee must.
Pay should therefore to Luboš G. half a million of crowns.
"At the moment as I can only say that the police is seeking to a person by using bribery during a public auction and bidding," said to Pravo the head of the Prosecutor General of Pilsen Antonie Zelena, adding that at the moment we cannot disclose more details about ongoing research.
Following twentyfour hours, the police let the employer of 46 years.
On the way in which could influence public auction, given the little official information, only be speculate.
The spokesperson of the Fund Agricultural Lubomira erna responded to questions of Pravo saying that the police carried out effectively the arrest at the headquarters of Pilsen and was during a public auction.
"It is a client, not one of our workers," said.
According erna, public auction is called "Call for the submission of proposals for transfer of fields in accordance with the law on land" and takes place when appear various stakeholders in connection with the ground offered.
"These people, for the convening, offers a higher value to its refund, that must be handed over before it advertise the value of field."
"In terms of tenders, it determines the order of the buyers and, after, the Fund Agricultural transferred the ground to the person that gives the greatest supply" explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information on who would be submitting to the invitation and, given that the time is interested person because purchased various rights of refund, proposed to the stakeholders on the ground that no participate in the auction.
For that favour, was charging a committee.
This explain that, at the time of arrest, had both money above.
Luboš G. had contacts with the Special Fund in Pilsen as long.
Included in the case of former head of the PF Vaclav Sankot, that was accused by dispatch the replacement of fields for which it had issued a decision of construction.
For example, Luboš G. just get of the Fund some fields provided for the construction of infrastructure public, in particular in the place where we should build a major road to the industrial area of Borska pole.
After, the changed a very beneficial to the judge by a home in the very centre of the historic city with a value much higher.
In this case, the city??council had to intervene because, otherwise, the fields blocked avoid the construction.
Families must pay some additional costs of several hundreds of crowns the month
The homes have to pay since January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, complements for heat and, in some cases, rent charges over.
Therefore, families will have to be drawn from the portfolio, from January, several hundreds of crowns the month more than now.
The price of electricity increases in a 4.6, gas around 2 per cent, in some cities should be paid to 10% more for the supply of water and many are contributing also the price of the heat central.
The rise of electricity for families living in flats should win promotion to approximately 100 crowns more than a year now.
However, the main suppliers of electricity reduced prices, because it has been increasing support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular the PV.
However, gas is expensive moderately, especially at the time in which more than it used the heat and, therefore, greater consumption.
In this case, must also have a couple of hundreds of crowns more than a year.
While the electricity and gas is expensive throughout the country, the change of price of the heat central varies from place to another.
The rise in prices the plans primarily the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kralove be paid by since January by the central heat a 50 crowns more than a month, while the families of Liberec be paid by more than 1,000 additional crowns the year.
The resident in Prague should also bear an increase of 9% of the price of water and the heat, especially in the event that the city increase the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Prague be paid by 6,8% an additional.
The price in Prague, however, will be among the lowest throughout the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates are more expensive a 7,4%.
Can greatly increase the price of rental of 450.000 Flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will be completed by January.
For example, the company ICC Byty, attaching Usti nad Labem in some 2.500 Flats, will increase the rent from January as to 100percent.
The company will be to the courts to those who do not agree with the new rental.
The rent charges regulated, to benefit residents of some 300,000 Flats, could increase next year to 10 per cent.
The Czech young people are drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it is slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen to their parents.
These are the beverages that lead to run out in care drinkers with a young age less than fifteen years.
Children who has just lying in the hospital continued to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of the doctors who are with such cases in the Admissions of pediatrics of hospital.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer out of fashion, because this has already taken some get drunk."
"Now fashion are the alcoholic beverages strong," indicates to Pravo the head of pediatrics of Hospital Hoovice at the centre of Bohemia, Ludke Pelikan.
"When manage to catch you a bottle to his father of the cupboard, can be whiskey, but normally it is Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage that it lightens with juice and that no smells both," explained.
It confirms also the spokesperson of the Hospital university Motol, Eva Jurinova.
"Normally, would normally be of Fernet or rum."
"These are the alcoholic beverages modern, in particular between the school."
"In some cases, use brandy that caught at home," adds Jurinova.
According to the head Pelikan, are drinkers 13 and fourteen years which may appear in the hospitals.
Before Hoovice, where they worked since this year, worked over a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulance bore for young people from areas near.
"A girl had to move perhaps four times."
"Started to the twelve years, when the brought to 3.5 of alcohol in blood, in addition a mixture of ecstasy," indicates the doctor of department on this case.
"Was in the Fair of Holešovice in some party of dance."
"As interesting is that a mother or is surprised that his daughter disappear 48 hours," we are surprised the head.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or even its clear tolerance towards the drink on the part of their children which is considered the main cause of increased consumption of alcohol among young people.
The experts noted that, in the case of children, we cannot talk itself of dependence.
"Is defined by alcoholic to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with the same, which it does not happen in children."
"In those that drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it must be a social environment or family consistently failed," explains the head Pelikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, this year in the clinical pediatric of Motol it hospitalized until the middle of November 40 children drunk.
However, statistics only show that go with a poisoning serious and should remain in the hospital.
Young people drinkers that, after the recognition walking medical, will be consistent with the parents or with the police, not have.
Furthermore cases in which children just sit in school and drink brandy, to Pelikan there are three fluctuations seasonal that it is worth mentioning: the day of witches, End of Year and the end of the current school.
"In such circumstances, drink for the poor notes or, on the contrary, held the beginning of the holiday."
"In the day of the witches have come to see in Admissions up to seven children drunk at the time," adds Pelikan.
The drinkers to spend the night in Detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next not suffer from a terrible hangover at home.
The headache morning, caused by the dehydration and the lack of glucose, it avoids with the injection of a serum with glucose and nutrients that is lacking at the international.
"What they are much better, because after the agitated night, it rise well and they are not hurts nothing."
"Only are confused regard to where they are," notes Pelikan, adding that, often, patients lose the right humor at least when they see the expenditure that have generated.
The transfer in ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for patients serious comes to cost us a ten of thousands of crowns.
"Often have used the cost as a means of educate, when the visit the addressed directly to the children how it has taken its drunkenness and that would have to move around the summer in a job for young people to earn enough to paid this evening," adds Pelikan.
The insurance, in its opinion perhaps as a measure regressive, that is back to the people the cost of treatment, it does not in the case of children drink.
Two aircraft L-59 are for the first time left outside in Spain
Two aircraft L-59 of a total of five, by which the Ministry of Defence Czech replaced the plane House -295M, left on Tuesday in Seville, where is the manufacturer of aircraft House -EADS.
It is the first time that a decision of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the army Czech.
At the moment, just spent abroad to conduct flight of practices or demonstration.
It is the version tandem L-59T1, that so far used the army Czech and that there was in state to fly.
The remaining three aircraft are the single-eater -159.
They still retains in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the out, the company Omnipol, has been done with them the week.
Jan Peješk, of department of the press of defence, indicates that have not yet know when it removed aircraft physically of Vodochody.
"Aircraft singl-seater L-59, in contrast, were separated from aircraft repaired some time, without investments and additional contributions from the Ministry."
"The tandem -159T1 it exchanged in its current state " said to Pravo Pejšek.
I added that the army is not left without aircraft tandem, shown that in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for an amount of $200 million crowns for the construction of four mechanisms L-59 unnecessary to tandem.
One of the new aircraft have already received the army in July, the other will be made available to the end of year.
According Pejšek, EADS committed to the aircraft was add the equipment of some countries allies.
"In the contract was clearly indicates that the company EADS is that withdrawn from aircraft -159 and that will serve to the practices of pilots countries of NATO. "
"Therefore, depends on the buyer to decide how it is going to use it in this context," notes Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodaske noviny published before time that, for example, the army Spanish are not interested in the L-59.
The exchange of five L-59 on a plane House and the purchase of other three Aircraft by 3.500 millions of crowns were adopted last year by the government of Mirek Topolanek.
The Ministry of Defence it convened a tend for the purchase and negotiated directly by EADS.
The current direction of defence argued that the trade promotes the export future of L-59 abroad.
The army Czech purchased for Aer 72 Aircraft and only used 24, for what it wants sell the rest.
The procurement of aircraft House probably would have consequences judicial.
The European Commission has already reported to the Ministry of Defence Czech before the European Court of Justice because should choose aircraft carrying out a tend European and not putting in contact with a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three aircraft House and the latter should be at the airport Prague of Kbely in fourteen days.
A finger index longer that the drop indicates a risk low suffer cancer
Men who have the longest index that the drop are subject to a lower risk of suffer cancer of Prostate.
This is astonishing conclusion of a explored published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
It could use the level of testosterone, the particular hormone male.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a test mere the risk of suffer cancer of Prostate, in particular to men with ages of up to 60 years," indicated the co of the study Ros Eeles, Professor of the Institute for research on cancer in the Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help to determine what men should be subject to proof of cancer of Prostate, in particular if this characteristic is associated with a risk genetic or other factors detrimental, as health problems families, as indicated Eeles.
During the period 1994-009, carried out followup with a British counterpart over $1.5 patients with cancer of Prostate and, simultaneously, of 3,000 men healthy.
More than half of the participants in the study had the finger Indica of the right hand shortest that the drop.
Had the same likely to suffer cancer of Prostate that 19 per cent of those whose fingers were the same length.
In the case of men with an index longer than the finger overturn, this risk is reduced in a 33; to men with ages below 60% reduction was 87 per.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, particular in the prenatal period, reflect different levels of hormones to those who is set out the foetus in the matrix.
A level of testosterone lower corresponds to an index longer.
Previous studies indicated that the testosterone effect in the development of cancer of Prostate.
The great geneticist Czech and former president of the Academy Science, the teacher Vaclav Paes, said to TK to know the study, but that it is not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and cancer can be "demonstrate fully."

The roads of the region that, given that this is a natural area protected, should simply be left in state inert, are accumulating up to five cm of snow, as indicates TK.
In Czech Republic fell between two and 10 cm of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the layer of snow reaches 18 cm.
In the region of Moravia -Silesia, fell around 15 cm of snow.
The snow gradually refer in Czech Republic.
The soldiers Americans have a new "weapon intelligent"
The American army is using in Afghanistan a new weapon "intelligent," known at the moment only in the name encoded XM-5.
The overall expect that the new rifle consideration in the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the progress of the game" done his victory.
New weapons are as a gun small and with a aim extremely precise.
Their bullets it shoot with a Laser with a stipulation of several meters.
Ammunition special gauge of 25 mm rifle created for this and the high burden of Remnants that contains causes that actually works as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be schedule to exploit not only when hit the objective, but in any point to be found in its record ballistics.
It can be used against the enemies that are hide after an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without doubt, we cannot use a protection order and, when Launches rain their murdering of chips metal, may be essential in the battle.
According Audette Richard, who spoke on the development of the XM-5, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry that uses a technology" intelligent "
"Soldiers the manipulate of such way that are the aim, aimed at the same its ray Laser, that determines the gap, then gets a coalface of accurate and, depending on the same, corrected the line of screening and press the trigger."
"Say that have been measured 543 meters."
"When it press the trigger, the weapon is burden and Launches the projectile to a range of 543 meters, more than one, two or three meters," notes Audette.
We are moving 400 jobs
The consortium Fujitsu shifting its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees change their place of work of their previous office building in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Star Park.
The consortium Japanese Fujitsu shifting its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported the giant of specialized sector in computers and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move in July of next year of their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Star Park, a large complex of offices in the street Lyoner Straße in the neighborhood of Niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A spokesperson Fujitsu explained that in the medium term other than 100 employees of consortium, that previously were scattered for the region, it staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition the office collective Star Park be beneficial how the work of the employees.
In addition, Fujitsu would be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner stated, "in Franfkurt- Niederrad we have found a central site with a good infrastructure "
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important today for a company and global Fujitsu.
The new moving of a company important in the region led yesterday joy between those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against.
The chief of section economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU) stated that with this has been won a "Player Comprehensive."
This is a "magnificent appreciation to the site."
Fujitsu it sets out in the city, the settlement is a great impetus to Niederrad.
The more of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (The Green) it regrets the decision to Fujitsu.
The direction reported prior to the city on its intention.
"Of course we have offered to the company our aid," stated Korwisi.
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the master of ownership in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, the economic reasons produced about the fall.
In this way, now there is a big place vacuum which cover in the post famous.
"I hope that the owner and the landlord of building is displayed cooperative."
The property previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbor "Kleine Vertikale" they belonged with the surplus buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial draft construction of the city spa.
As a joint project of the city and a private company projects between the station and the city??council it is a new entry to the city, that is responsible for the criticism with regard to the construction massive than previously used the holes as squares of parking and in terms of the level of buildings.
In 2001 have been installed the counseling of investment and business of appraisal, the manufacturer of Software for systems of reservations, Start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the home manufacturer of computers Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used to Fujitsu was made by the group real estate of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien -Chancen- Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, native of Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest provider of global IT.
Available enterprises, for example of computers and servants, and it is also the services accurate.
The branch in Rhein -Main- Gebiet is one of the elderly in Germany, of all ways Fujitsu account with more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is installed since Bad Homburg in Frankfurt -Niederrad, the following branches in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDS.
That is why we have rented 7.000 meters square in the building of office of Star Park.
The complex old the years 20, its name refers to its level with a star, has inter alia to the association of central electrical and industry electronic.
Amazon cancel the server -Threats against Assange
The anguish it hold becoming more Wikileaks.
The provider of services of Internet Amazon has eliminated the platform of revelations of its server.
Possibly behind it will find political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of documents secret diplomatic.
Assange, the founding of Wikileaks, it appears that is detained in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Activists Internet lost access to its previous server American and currently seeking a homeland of Internet in Europe.
The wellknown Senator American, Joe Lieberman, called upon other countries and companies to boycott of Wikileaks.
And the founding of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, that it is in the list of persons sought of INTERPOL, must remain detained in Great Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled of server of Amazon."
"Speak freely in the country of the freedom," communicated activists the revelations through the service of Messaging Twitter Wednesday (time local).
Shortly before, the company of Internet, Amazon, had eliminated the documents of Wikileaks of its server.
The Internet activists had been used in the issuance of documents diplomatic door to the web services Amazon to meet the high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained as follows: "Perfect, and we will spend our dollars to engage with people in Europe."
If Amazon have problems with freedom of expression, "should stop selling books."
Amazon detention the use of its server through Wikileaks, after that an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman have requested investigations, reported the chain CNN according to a call to the office of Lieberman.
The chairmanship of the tip of the senate for the security of the country had threatened to Amazon with boycott, reported the British "Guardian."
"Had laid down that Amazon make these measures before, before the previous publication of information is collated by Wikileaks," declared the Senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban in other countries the use of server.
"The process illegal, monstrous and inconsiderate of Wikileaks put at stake our national security and threat life in the world," stated in a statement of Senator independent.
"Any company responsible, whether American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with his service to extend material stolen.
The founding of Wikileaks, Assange, that is sought in Sweden for suspected of violation, is in the list of persons sought of INTERPOL.
According to a newspaper article of London "The Independent," the Australian of 39 years is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard know the exact place.
The activist Internet has consistently rated the investigation in Sweden as a plot of its enemy.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that have existed threats.
"There was even call on a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why everyone afraid of it by the security of Assange, stated Hrafnsson.
Therefore, is without revealed the location of the founding of Wikileaks.
Hrafnsson respond clearly to the statements of America.
In America, the former governor Republican of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsibility of the revelations of Wikileaks must be judged by betrayal and must be implemented.
In Canada, stated an advisor of the head of government Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, in the television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "using a drone."
Among the White House and Assange is a major dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesperson of the US President Barack Obama, called of "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has asked for the resignation of the secretary of state, in the event that it is responsible for recently ordered to diplomats to be get involved in tasks of espionage.
"I am not entirely sure why we must importing the opinion of any kind with a web page," stated Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of that country are much stronger than its website."
The American government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of their databases of a general way.
Russell Travers, deputy director distribution of the National Centre against terrorism, was appointed for exceptional, announced the White House.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms," that are necessary in the light of the filtration of Wikileaks.
The White House also want to inspect the paths, as well as changing the comprehensive information on the government and protect.
In addition, the American Government announced that on account of the security of the dissidents and activists, should jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything possible to be in contact with them," stated the spokesperson of the Department of State, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to help protect them if necessary."
The report of ice cream
In the "Gelato University" in Bologna are prepared ice cream in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future ice cream has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
In reality where is the whole ice cream?
The gelatiere and the gelataio.
The gelatiere designing the cream according to all the rules of some Italian of the development of ice cream.
The gelataio out with a spatula the cream of ice cream of counter, the extended on the wafer and the sold.
To say that, need not go to Anzola dellEmilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wishes to know more about ice cream, should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped to the report of ice cream with the freezer in the year 2003, to the cream of ice cream of their machines fulfil the high ideals Italian in all parts.
The basic course of three days for future ice cream has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
There are also more special courses more days on the ice cream of chocolate and practices in the ice cream of the home.
In these times of crisis, some dream with a new career, other risk in the soft ice cream its vague desires.
This time are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Saudi happening in Hungary.
To Jacky, Professor of the art of California, thrilled the slow movement of food and in the future will offer a European product quality in land ice cream of industrial.
Anke, Berlin, is advisory of enterprises and wants to create something own in some years within a working nerve-acking.
Two young Egyptian dream with an open ice cream in the Cairo.
A man of Malta and another Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream of their bars, and a love of home canadian, Julia, is because of their children are love the ice cream Italian.
The teacher ice-ream man Luciano Ferrari attributable to the participants subsequently the skills ideals of ice cream perfect.
It is critical not only its good taste, but also its softness silky and their good and.
Luciano not forget their training and the cover of cream of the home higher national and primarily of the south of the country: "The ice cream Italian is simply the best, and that is why every ball is something romantic."
The first step in the development seems snap.
Luciano lack the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk in dust, sugar and stabilizers in a great mixer, that heated all with an electronic programme to 85 grades and at the moment the cool up to four grades.
It opens the tap of the item and emerges a basic cream tide pasteurized, the basis for all types of ice cream of milk.
Suddenly, the teacher question: The cream of ice cream can be worked out only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can we give free rein to some desire of experience?
Luciano advised that it mislead of the trends of the time.
The talk of ice cream "not only of natural ingredients," to the best used stabilizers, primarily a natural product, probably Rubber guar, of bean guar.
Of course that it can produce ice cream without stabilizing, only be buy a day, place in a bag and the client bite a sound ice cream of granite.
It allows certain variations in the mass basic.
Are aromas.
With regard to the taste of ice cream, the teacher Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients which are bought in the section of fruit or in the sweet of supermarket.
Also, there powders and pasta.
"All suppliers attempt strain ingredients Flavoured in their commodity."
"However must experience any time."
It is with sorbets of fruit with sugar and fruit fresh.
Or even with the cream of ice cream of the estate basic tide, that with eggs will be a cream yellow and to cocoa in dust as a basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the participants of course can use the chilly.
Luciano are left to each time four different types of ice cream of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the mass basic, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Are the same experiment also with types of ice cream of fruit.
We know best is not necessarily to be more aroma of toffee or more puree of fruit.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of Hazelnuts knowledge to nuts, if it contains more Hazelnuts.
The working group made the adored ice cream of kiwi, be used more fruit, less water and anything less of stabilizing.
First a balanced mixture highlights the taste of ice cream, states Luciano.
The development of ice cream is a problem of arithmetic: An used the puree of peach with much sugar, we must lower the proportion of sugar from the basic recipe.
For the ice cream of lemon need a portion extra of sugar.
Luciano out a utensil with which determined the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (measurement of winegrower to Oechsle in the must of grape).
Fortunately the tables facilitate the consideration.
Develop ice cream it requires more than the application or, as soon.
Not only help the utensil for the development automatic of the estate basic.
There is also a utensil, in which it bat simultaneously the mixture of ice cream prepared and is cool to temperature under zero.
Despite all, the entire Automation been left out in regard to the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo this blight to himself and his colleagues above to down with puree of fruit, as if a miniprimer giant without control.
"In all the courses," affirms the teacher Luciano, "is only a matter of time that length something that."
Inspectors in a difficult situation
The authority European safety of food EFSA it has crept into the industry that experience with plants transgenic.
Currently this matter it made the group of experts Testbiotech, to be considered an institute for the independent evaluation of impact of biotechnology.
"Seems a theory of conspiracy but we have documented well," stated Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts from EFSA on plants genetically modified, and another expert from EFSA are also employed for years in the partnership ILSI.
The consortia as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer the Costean.
Kuiper has cooperated significantly in the rules of check of EFSA of plants genetically modified, what is moving in a clear conflict of interests, criticism Then.
The provisions of EFSA are above with equal terms with the documentation of the situation of ILSI and mimic the writing of the company, that in reality is under control by the Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticism a conflict of interests.
This, recently, a manager of high rank of EFSA was without the support and the time of transition to the switzerland Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed with that its side.
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal links between the authorities of the inspection of the EU and the industry, to place the Officinal SecretaryGeneral of the Environment as well as a clairvoyant member of the EU.
However, EFSA could not recognize any conflict of interests.
It used to all the data formal, also to some of the industry, always be a high and technical quality, it ordered in a report.
It is not required to experts working in EFSA that do not have any contact with the industry.
But they must address these contacts.
Kuiper admitted their work for the International Institute (Life Sciences ILSI) in EE. UU.
It is defined in itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, among others for the assessment of risk for biotechnology but on behalf of Lobby.
In this, independent experts, as Then, criticize that is currently allow plants transgenic without addressing the food for animals and that is not check the influence of the plants genetically modified in the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, for the genetically modified maize in agriculture," states Then.
The current practice is to verify only Protein isolated, but not the plant GM whole, which offers no reliable results.
"If it is not seeking the risks, how we are going to find?," question, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck view of the same way.
The scientific investigation since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and currently working in the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, industry is trying to increasingly, in EE. UU. and in Europe, influence or discredit to scientists critical.
That is why, there are few scientists that there are influenced by consortia.
For companies, studies critics are not published as a general rule.
"Industry monitors the investigation of the security," maintains Hilbeck.
The record of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total approximately 400 kilos.
On Monday was before the station of Stuttgart, with the Tuba in the hands.
There were demonstrations
Snowing.
The story is known: In September had arrived the excavators and began to reason a great piece of wing north.
The land of Stuttgart never returned be the same: Miles and thousands demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As was sealed, the greater part of wing it hizo debris.
Broken on 6, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a litmus soft rugosa, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is sculptor in Ostfildern, is 43 years.
It has ensured a couple of pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"Must not disappear."
It excited: "A litmus cheap and poor, simple and natural."
As stated eleven, has smelt the smoke of cigarettes.
Still do not know what will be with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The record of the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous deposit of ammunition stockpiles of the French ForceAPF, where Manuel Rongen erected the litmus Stein -Reich.
The man of 44 years is with stones former.
It has bought everything that comes from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"Should shame, grind the gravel or the send to dump," states in his office, a cottage of wood that eleven was a stand of oncall.
It is insulted and threatened, explained, when, in September, appeared in the newspapers, that had bought the remnants of wing north to the company of Demolitions.
The dealt with the enemies of 21S for several days.
And they explained that it could do nothing for the throw.
And if so, then was the most reasonable, when the stones continued being used.
Some 200 enemies of S21 took the massif 80 kilos cut, with a price for piece of 6,50 to 14 EUR.
Some it was as memory but also with the hope of power return in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, a burden of 25 trucks.
Approximately half is still in the forest, the rest is time that it sold.
Master of gardens, gardener landscape, responsible for projects.
Arrived of all parties and were what could be in the trunk and above.
The litmus Stuttgart the momentum for a long time it has become "the wall" or in the definition of Kräuterbeeten.
"In reality the litmus is nothing special," states Rongen.
"If it were for the political component."
Amounts to their SUV, is a tour for their great united 20 ha.
Explored right, interrupted their studies, and later biology, is our computers and finally worked with stones.
And it is lover of the stones.
Hosts to 4.000 tonnes of litmus.
Transports their treasures for all Germany.
States have the greatest Trader of stones longstanding of the country.
Hampers.
In the snow is artistic stones of sandstone chopped.
"Belong to bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," explained.
Limestone dawn, yellow, warm, it excited.
"My dear litmus."
The way crosses the forest.
Notes a huge amount: Sandstone bottom, a piece previous station of Karlsruhe.
And.
"Nice Travertine."
Formerly the massif they were from the rostrum of Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
For all parties in the snow, stones and stories, Travertine yellow of the chiefly by police in Stuttgart, granite red of the church Sankt Blasien, tuff of hospital of Heilbronner.
What work, what efforts, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about as sculpted before the stones and the moved with a simple rig and a cart, is felt very devotee.
"Would be a scandal if something is destroyed."
It has become rich, in all immensely rich.
But today 14 people were given to the Trader of stones, in addition beds, a sculptor, a smith, a glazier and a gardener have been installed above in the forest.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfactory," affirms the man who is responsible for taking the remnants.
In short it has to go to Cologne.
There also needs stones that rescue.
Fight of talents around great potential
Relatively active influx in the buffet.
16 students are crowd around the muffins, the soup of tomato and the sweet.
The University Technical of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of cars Volkswagen have invited to a workshop to students of Mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of participation of ideas, have to speak on the car of the future with the workers of VW and in addition to learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivaling and the same way, many companies, as VW, sit in a fight body to body and some minds more privileged in collaboration with universities.
Its mission: Hiring as soon as possible to students with more talent to do so by universities, before coming into the labour market and are employed by other.
And as universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of their students, it tries peep to the talents exceptional in projects practical and capture them.
The second day of project at the University Technical of Braunscheig, the consortium is made to the talents.
A Miss of department of staff distributed pens, gummies and folders with the logo of VW.
Due to the excited young people talents programmes of practices and work for students and they showed its paths in the consortium.
Nico Seal of the University Technical of Braunschweig for the project to VW.
See benefits for both parties: "The students come into contact with the industry and emerge experience."
"To turn, VW may be available to students, see more closely to the candidates interesting and consider as possible future workers."
Some partnerships, said Seal, there is little common.
The novelty is that students will be desired as directly.
"The main point earlier was in the projects technical," states Seal.
The fight for the graduates fresh is becoming tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees among a large group of applicants.
If not we have to advertise and, on all, to achieve a labour highly qualified.
All students of the disciplines of engineering are in an excellent situation of negotiation.
According to the Partnership German of Engineers (VDI for their acronym in German), in October existed 40.000 posts vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognostic of the VDI, this vacuum of engineers grow even more.
In the company of audit and advice, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the Hunting of talents.
Organized expensive in events of recruitment, as career KPMG, a kind of treasure hunt modern, in which the participants have to find their way through the coordinated of GPS.
The company wants to send eight students very promising to EE. UU. the following year.
In addition participants can see the branches of KPMG and learn about the company.
It is decided who must be in two rounds of choice in the marketing.
Only the crème of the crème of many participants will EE. UU.
Universities make an effort increasingly in choosing and polish to the high potential of universities, according Dykta.
"With the task we want to highlight the mass."
"The haul simple alone we lay short."
For the scout Dykta the notes are results.
"To date we have a similar action in the past year with all the participants."
"Some are close to its end, and want seeking work with us," states.
Apart from closer contact with the campus, are also to the Hunting, on all, small and mediumsized enterprises, classic with their Fairs of work.
"We are trying to students in the Fairs specialized."
"Something on Intersolar," states Sitha Stübe, charge of staff for the manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
The company Bonner has approximately $1.5 employees in Germany.
Stübe know the problem of the new generation.
Currently the website of the company appear 35 vacant posts.
"Is still very complicated fill the vacant posts."
"Costs too much time and money," states.
A path is the most immediate contact with the teachers of the university.
There is SolarWorld with several schools higher, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that we can do practices with us or carry out their thesis.
There are costly publicity campaigns for specialists solar.
That is why the company needs promoted with other benefits: Fund staff, hierarchy flat and communication agreeable.
"A great consortium usually cannot offer," stated Stübe, the charge of staff.
In the search for a job, the money is no longer the most important.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good possibilities of high.
According to a study of Great to Work Place Instituts, Solarworld amongst the square 55 of the 100 better employers of Germany.
The institute designing an annual list of the best suppliers of employment German.
To that question to the court is satisfied that it is with the work and with the environment in the same and notes the conditions of employees.
Stübe, the charge of staff also expect extra points in its classification for their aspirants to work.
"I believe that the applicant sets especially in the classifications outside of a potential employer," states.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advised to companies that want a longterm strategy that will win a good fame as employers.
Advised to their clients more authenticity.
And that means, according Kriegler, on all, domestic measures.
"The best way to be made attractive as an employe's own employees " ensured.
In the language of the sector is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of identity Corporate within their own staffing.
"A few employees satisfied they are the best ambassadors."
When it is good to the people and it identifies with the company, then it achieves promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"Is like a game with gang," states Kriegler.
Obama stop new perforations oil
Since the costs of US state of Florida the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years no new drilling oil.
The government in Washington issued a strong ban and with this annulled its previous plans of a final.
Also before the costs Atlantic or new perforations closed at the moment.
This announced the Minister of Interior, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What led the strict ban, that at least will apply the following five years, is the explosion of the platform oil "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the unfortunate that cost life to eleven employees and led the greatest environmental disaster for the EE. UU., the president Barack Obama had recognized new perforations on the part West of Gulf of Mexico under pressure of the opposition and the industry.
The support they wished thus reduce the dependence of EE. UU. of new supplies of oil from abroad.
To date not been clarified by all who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the centre of the critical is the energy consortium British BP, that is faced with millions of demands.
A committee of inquiry responsible for Obama will submit its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the Minister of Interior, removed the moratorium of drilling after the explosion.
Subsequently, various consortia peteroleros submitted applications for new attempts of drilling.
Obama and Salazar want put a new disaster using a tougher controls and some regulations more stringent security.
Currently the supervisory authority responsible, that after having been accused of charges of corruption has fallen in discredit, the reform of root.
Obama said by way parallel that it close the gaps prosecutors profit for the consortia of oil and gas.
The industry announced publicly that the extraction total in the Gulf will be less thanks to a regulation more strict, to date.
"The plans of government are the biggest brake on growth industries oil and gas," said the outcome of the current survey carried out by the advisory committees BDO -before the prohibition of extraction of Wednesday.
American Energey Alliance is complaining of insecurity in the sector: "No know what exactly with changing the regulation."
Investments in new projects one will extend to the early, detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is brown oil, smells as a gas station: Million of liters discharges of crude have torn apart nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
The people lives of theft, corruption and illegal trade in oil.
To Celestine Akpobari is well.
"Not I tire," reassuring the environmental activist journalists: "Today happen sufficient oil to your eyes."
The Nigeria 37 years has been photograph to boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the clearly reflected in turbulence in the area: but the colorful brightness of water, the scene almost seems pretty.
It is not that on the surface float spots brown of oil.
Before this picked prawns to handfuls, explained Esther Badom in the bank of River Bodo -Jetty.
While, the water fluid are completely killed.
Five years ago it into in the formidable wetland a staggering amount of oil by a pipe broken.
The fish of the Area of the small town of Bodo given that swim six hours to reach water full of fish: That, at the heart of the Niger delta and strong position in Ogoniland, is considered as one of the regions more plague-of the world.
In the way of come of River that passes through Mangroves, the extended sorrow is obvious.
Instead of water clear, the engine of the ship removes a broth brown, who immerse its power in the water, will draw a full of oil.
The roots of trees of the Mangroves it rise since the soil as dark sticks of licorice, sadly isolated the palm trees that collide and hang their palms.
In vain is seeking flocks of birds, as if made in the wetland as always: In terms is silent the barrier of foreign, it expands it a kind of calm ghostly a paradise previous with smell to gas station.
"What is happening here is a fight environmental," states, shy, Celestine Akpobari. "Live in constant danger to health."
Now the comparison war.
The area of settlement of the Ogoni is a hard-ought battlefield for years: Here burst for over 60 years the first Browsers Europeans, here we organized the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro Wiwa-, later implemented, here had to put their first work establishment the consortium Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of oil.
Even today it is forbidden the return of companies to Ogoniland: While pumped daily more than two million barrels golden black throughout the region of the delta, of a size three times greater than that Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of mining and 7.000 kilometres of pipes, the fields oil in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable to the consortium.
Each two hundred meters protruded platforms of steel as bizarre sculptures of water: "Trees of Christmas" called lovingly to the warheads of the drilling.
They have up to 50 years, the majority file a corrosion total.
At every moment wrong a head, believes Akpobari, then mana jet a constant of oil in the water.
According to the reviews of experts, have been made over two thousand litres in 50 years in the ecosystem of the delta: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the breakdown of the ship "Exxon Valdez" is 21 years at is of Alaska, one of the major disasters ecological of the history of mankind.
Who is responsible for the lasting region environmental, will deal with this.
While the consortium of Shell and the theft organized of oil are responsible for more than 90 per cent of pollution, the green see to the heads a process of breaking up and the pipes with leakage as the main brought.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly lower safety standards normally in the world the conventional, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to consortium in 2008: Only the indices of shortcomings of the pipes are "on a multiple greater than in another place."
In a place, that since far seems to be forgotten, appears a workshop with oil under the sky free, arise figures between the Mangroves: Are naked and covered in oil.
Between one of the many barrels, that they are sometimes along with the perforations, sometimes scattered arbitrarily on the ground, Flames a fire: a small refinery illegal.
At the barrel, oil is heated in the fire more hours, explained Michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, the Gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the pipe of oil drips and finally emerges diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produced on a daily basis until four barrels of diesel 300 liters: "We provides 34.000 naira," around 22 United.
The inhabitants of the delta exercising the shortage of fuel in one of the greatest united oil of Africa slick.
Nigeria own account with a single refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of only EUR 40 -centimo by liter the Heaters illegal immigrants can offer even less: So reduce the value of its raw material.
Is invested from "those of the bunkers," that truncated the network of pipes that are going through Ogoniland: According to experts, to this step will be lost at least 20 litres of oil per day in all the Niger delta of.
Only an insignificant part of the material raw material provisional stored it refines clearly illegally: The organized criminal networks, also belong to the political and military senior positions, observed the better part in cisterns and the sell expensive in the global market.
The activist Akpobari regarded purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe should be rather to management of the population or to the sluggish way of production.
"If the oil is not behave as invasive and would not completely destroyed habitat the nature of the fish, would not have sabotage, or theft, or refineries illegal."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are destroyed above all by Shell to the point that only gives a deduction of consortium: "Perhaps is better to submit another nationality, as the Chinese."
Michael casts nerve.
"It is high time that desaparezcais," said the muscular Ölmann.
"Soldiers can come at any minute."
If the special Unit of the army catch to the Refiners illegal, they are not threat to arrest, if not with a painful using bribery.
The soldiers from the north also want, as all Nigerians, take advantage of the raw material.
"This sentenced invention has done pieces completely to our country," states Akpobari.

29 miners age between 17 and 62 years were buried in the undermines.
It introduced a probe in the place of the misfortune, but not found no sign of survival.
Owing to the high concentration of greenhouse explosions case after case hazardous and, a team of rescue could bring down for reasons of security.

To hell, warrior!
The gore fits in the cinema art?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn turning to explore the borders of gender with its epic of battles "Walhalla Rising."
In what the public will be intended the director Danish Nicolas Winding Refn to roll "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior viking prisoner with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is discharged their torturers and murdering their enemies with struggles almost superhuman, sounds ideal for spectators young people seeking action bloody, precisely because of our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and start their enemies the guts of their bodies with life when it is wrong humor.
Moreover, Unojo, as is called in reality, not said almost no floor during the entire film and the other characters been carried out by as much one or two phrases or a few painful uproar fatal.
Otherwise it silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying landscapes hilly of Scotland, that the racks offer the world viking of approximately one thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for filmmakers grown and stakeholders in the existentialism and movements of house very calm.
When a film has various target groups is a pity that it can put another.
The director Winding Refn considered at its wild and the trilogy on the hairstyle trafficker of drugs "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses stoically to make their work are for all the public with something more than humor in the flow main or a less brutality of the home artistic.
A mass cerebral and a guts that spring cannot todeter most supporters of cinema art.
The majority of the fans of the action is dying of boredom, if Unojo catch a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of missionaries cristioneros violent for reasons interpretable and it is jammed a eternity in the calm and the fog before his team found America and return to shut up there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found distributor film in Germany and only will be published in DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent pictures, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody façade, it hide a morsel of cinema sometimes exciting, that deserve attention.
This film it is dialogues or of an action logic, all is a, a dream febrile transformed in film.
And why there is no escape for the spectators.
Refn condede is hardly a time of relaxation and their pictures glaciers and the lugubrious band sound of trance is always a knot in its throat, on all, the incredible hatred, that since the hearts of the characters going to him.
Only a small young blond, that supports Unojo accurately, preserving something as innocence, all the others are possessed by the anger.
Above all, the hero of a single eye, these reasons it is not spelled ever, it becomes any time in a warrior come from burning hell for enemies and allies provisional, possibly in the ambassador of the same hell.
The represents the perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost in any case.
"Walhalla Rising" is a film mysterious that can be hate and admire, to get angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious movements of land
The organization of nuclear energy IAEA has new signs of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country rejects comment on this issue so that they allow controls.
On the average night of 5 to September 6th, 2007, at least four Israeli aircraft combat F-5 I attacked a mysterious building cubic in Syria.
It is in the bank of Euphrates; the city more and more closely, to 30 kilometres is Dair as -Saur.
His name appears in document of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is on a reactor which it appears that the Syrian built to help North Korea in the cube, hidden in a Valley that emerges from River.
According to information of intelligence service of international EE. UU. of the CIA for the end of April 2008, will design a reactor flow under the name of the close of the -Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which they are being built nuclear weapons.
In contrast, the technical only serves to other purpose than to those of the fifty years.
The CIA had shown a presentation on video with pictures of satellite fuzzy.
Showed with a animation by computer where they were members of the reactor before the destruction, that was a copy low of model North Korea of the power plant Yongbyon.
In addition taught photographs that showed the building since the close or from the interior.
Article little time that the reactor was in operation, said, but was not yet equipped with bars of fuel.
Today, three years later the bombing, is hardly more known that at the time, the enigmas were increased with the time.
The previous President of the EE. UU., George W. Bush revealed recently in its memories that before the attack the CIA was entirely sure that the Syrian had built a reactor in the -Kibar, but that only saw indications that in the country there" a programme of nuclear weapons "
In Europe, various actors of the secret service preferred be even more prudent and only speak of a "course reactor," although considered "plausible" the submission of the CIA.
Were there is solid evidence, as well as to the IAEA.
When it asked what was certain that have to face a reactor, a highlevel diplomatic of the NU responded in summer of a lapidary that the IAEA has "enough material to questions."
The Syrian rid been very fast of the debris of alleged "building military disabled" and paved the ground to realize.
However, in June 2008 a team of the IAEA under the command of the former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found dreadlocks of uranium in the -Kibar, that had been made for people.
In addition the IAEA was satellite pictures on a State member, of sellers trade at the moment just after the attack, that must be a value most of the information presented the CIA.
However, those photographs not arrived at the market because a client unknown, perhaps Israel, the bought of a specific.
That is why the IAEA cannot verify their authenticity irrespective.
Syria always given to understand that had never been a secret nuclear programme and built a reactor.
The uranium came of the Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
The IAEA is rejected as improbable after the analysis of the particulate.
Since then Damaskus refuses to discuss the matter, of equal manner on the satellite pictures.
In addition, to the controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the -Kibar and the entry to the ruins of the building bombed.
Also Israel is a restrictive silence.
"Ever the comment," Ehud Olmert, prime minister in place at the time of attack, confirmed recently the official position.
This, the investigation of the case has not yielded any results since June 2008 and "is changing progressively in a serious problem of credibility for the authorities," as a diplomatic West of high position corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, finally there is still a serious offence against the Treaty nonproliferation of weapons fissile, for the assured that the IAEA.
The IAEA considers three teams more as the key to progress in the clarification, that must be "functional in connection" with the alleged reactor, and others as such there are still.
The inspectors have not made publicly available so far what teams are dealt, or what functions have, or whether suspects seem.
According to the regular Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA has been designated as internal to Marj as -Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again from changes close cities situated.
The independent Institute for International Science and Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings close Masyaf with the images satellite, that very probably be considered one of the items suspected.
Possibly be found in or immediately to hand a military base, Syria prohibited for this reason the entry to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna was said that the Syrian fear a register that the EE. UU. has been requested to the IAEA to spy the plants military.
The detectives alert nuclear spent on teams thanks to the warnings of secret service of the EE. UU.
Photographs through satellite, the IAEA has some indications that is shifting material among the three locations and the cube to the bank of Euphrates.
A diplomatic West with a high office in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams can be "related to the production of fuel."
But there is no "no sign of activities sensitive," or enrichment of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is drives with enriched uranium which is not.
Where must come the uranium and where it should be separated plutonium subsequently for the pumps, to these questions are central, in the best of cases, supposition plausible.
Moreover there are doubts about whether the ruins, the valuable clues that can recover, are in the three places.
As disappeared the hundreds of burden of lorries of soil, no one is information on where stay the debris.
The OIAE considered unlikely that undermines of salt to -Tibni, strong position in the few kilometres from the- Kibar to the other part of Euphrates, that the Syrian recognized in 1998 by its ability as area for waste radioactive.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the IAEA, the related with the reactor in an analysis of the satellite pictures for the prestigious magazine Jane' Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrian made movements of land in the three scenarios places suspects and eliminated large containers after which the IAEA request the entry.
Can be a coincidence but hardly contributes to dispel suspicion.
In addition, in the sector diplomatic notes that the IAEA has used some months to develop a plan of inspections there, that the Syrian allow, to maintain the possible secret military, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damaskus criticism this proposal too.
The Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago it reassured with the reactor was already destroyed, that is why the matter is not great urgency, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a kind of ambassador of the EE. UU. wields the call inspections exceptional, one of the media more rigorous that nuclear authorities Viennese have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, that should propose these inspections, has spoken of "a choice to which I opened in the future," but still hesitate.
This way it is very risky: To that is needed most of the Council of Governorate of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not very anxious to an escalation.
Moreover, as thought a diplomatic: "and what happens if at the end there are no?"
The love in times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in summer with the direction of his debut still without behalf.
Similarly she has written the script, a history of love between a Bosnian and Serbian a.
We do not know more about, but this is sufficient for the uproar.
The rumor is very persistent, women, Muslim, it love of its rapist Serbian during the war in Yugoslavia.
Women' associations Bosnian have protested rapidly, with which in the last time moved some days of filming planned in Sarajevo in Hungary.
The film has been ro in Hungary and in the post-roduction, but there is still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization female victims of war had written to the Added Commissioner of the UN, UNHCR, by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported on a regular Bosnian, Jolie is the ambassador of the Added Commissioner of the UN for refugees.
It is not diplomatic, a few women it were a meeting in Hungary which rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, states Hasecic.
There are no stories of love in the fields of violations, and the position of Jolie in this regard betrays to victims enough on the script.
His organization in accordance with the Added Commissioner of the UN for refugees has been recommended remove to Jolie as ambassador, informed the Guardian.
But what has been written exactly Jolie for the Scenes?
The Ministry of Culture Bosnian that read the script, gave after a strip and loose a permit of recording in Sarajevo, is not clear why Jolie was not in spite of all.
The young author reiterates that it is not pursuing political purposes with its film, been introduced with great effort in the conflict Yugoslav, to show the horrible terrorist consequences of war and to give voice to all parties involved.
Its content remains imprecise.
In the network circulating a second overview of the film that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the start of the war and go back to be found when it, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to an area Serbian in which I worked as oncall.
What sounds significantly different is the variant "victim of violation is love of torturer."
It is certain that the film of Jolie actually began before the war.
The pressure on her, states Jolie, is "unjust and based on information wrong."
Today can achieve peace with the hackers of Hollywood: While that the script is in the network of illegally, as many others before.
Nothing as far from here
This evening finally turning to be good for the Irish.

A great loss for this small country with only 4,5 millions of people.
The Forecasts will confirm, is a migratory flood comparable to that suffered the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that suit a great benefit to the Irish, currently covers the melancholy.
The economic crisis confused above all to young people, Irish well educated, for those who until now, all costs is above.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years of.

"To the starting to work, do so abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps for conducting your race," affirms the manager.
In its website feature photos a boy practicing surf in Australia and other practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Work abroad is not as do so in the galleys, if not that this entails freedom and fun.
For the year, Sean ODonovan knows how to build something in another place.
Since no longer had nothing to do for the engineer of 29 years, currently working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction in Germany.
Now rise an interim fashion to Gelsenkirchen.
In January is going to Hannover or in Berlin, the following draft.
ODonovan see their homeland only seldom because working overtime to be able to pay a credit to his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," states, as long ago the first time that stepped the threshold of their home.
"Won money in Germany for a home in Ireland, in the ever I am as well."
It laughs something embarrassed and it is for rooms frost.
The small house is in a elegant area residential with care gardens to the homes, in the entry are parked cars big and expensive.
ODonovan bought the home together with its sister for four years by 380.000 EUR, 100 by one hundred financed by a credit.
"Were times the insane, had been easy money but many questions," said.
Are afraid of failure to credit?
ODonovan does a time, provide more tea hot and said: "No I have children who have to providing food and I am young; if all emerges bad, can start from scratch."
The civil engineer it is not popular complaints that often heard today.
"No one should move hunger, our situation is not, with great difference, so dramatic as in times past here in the island," states.
"Work a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with this we are for the first time as Irish."
It laughs and counts on their father, that in the last great economic crisis it was to England.
"After seven years again and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
To Cian Tanner is popular these ideas.
Failing pending the future and simply do as is life in another part.
It worked a couple of years in London and why not they would go well to him and his Bride in New Zealand?

"Farewell, sounds very distressing."
"Better that we call the man replied A day to proceed, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of beverages, a couple of games."
The democratic routine
Continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the right to private companies.
The crime creates greater concern that unemployment.
In addition, in large part of the region, is to Brazil as a country more influential that the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest survey of Latinobarometro carried out in 18 countries and distributed only to The Economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allow monitoring of changes in attitude in the region.
In the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and early October, highlight two issues.
The first is the humor relatively lively reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of the attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in various countries of the Pacific coast of South (be consulted the table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per annum since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61% this year.
Grew also in Mexico, where the economy has been regained after suffer a large decline in production the past year.
However, only half the rate of Mexico and Brazil, the two countries with larger populations the area, are democrats believe, which lower the average regional (be consulted the figure 2).
Approximately 44 per cent of respondents in the region was declared satisfied with the way in which working democracy in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but considerably higher per cent recorded in 2001 (figure 3).
Some of 34% stated that trust in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in his Government, the same number as last year in both cases, but significantly higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turbulence in Latin America affected greatly to support democracy.
The fact that has been maintained for the global financial crisis probably it ought to many American countries only was again affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a network social security stronger has contributed to protect the poorest.
(the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increase marginally in 2009 and that it has fallen again this year, to the (32%.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (be consulted the figure 4).
The good economic returns of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sentiment of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and have increased violent crime.
For the second time since initiated surveys, more rate in Latin America mentioned the crime, in place of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (be consulted the figure 5).
Around 31% of claims, make them or a relative near, has been victims of crime in the past year, a figure that has been reduced from 38 per cent of last year and that is the lower percentage recorded since 1995.
The economic returns more positive is reflected in greater support to private enterprises and to the market economy: around 71% of the respondents in the region say that private firms are indispensable for the development, while in 2007 was the only 56 per cent (be consulted the figure 6).
Some About 58 per cent agrees that the market economy is the only system that will enable his country was developed, front to 47% in the past year.
It is interesting that the 62 per cent of respondents in Venezuela think the same (and 80 per cent support to private companies), although its chairman leftist, Hugo Chavez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country which exercises a greater leadership in the region, as indicates 19 per cent of respondents (face up to 18 the past year), followed by the United States (9 per, same number as last year) and Venezuela (the forefront 9 to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, United States is the country considered more influential by respondents in Mexico and a large part of Central America, while Venezuela amongst such title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the trash
Nobody expected that the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, passed a way much worse than it feared foreigners who attempt to help the country to go back after their problems.
It introduced votes in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots runs in the sewers, election place destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Schools election opened with hours late.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake of January, wandering in the area trying uncovering where were to vote.
Some of them, at the end, were up.
A dozen of candidates to the presidential, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and called the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of these violent, it extended throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the staff member of the United Nations higher rank in Haiti, stated that were "elections relatively good in many ways."
Observers of the Organization of American States OAS and the Caribbean Community affirmed, carefully, that "not believe that these irregularities, so serious that are, invalidate necessarily the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The election authority, that according to their opponents is engaged with Rene Preval, the unpopular outgoing President, and with its candidate, Jude Celestin, should announcing the preliminary results on December 7th.
It is anticipated that the replay will take place in January.
They have not yet lost all hope in connection with elections.
The two main candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, have withdrawn their initial request in the requested the invalidation of the vote.
But still problems may arise if the election authority stated that Mr. Celestin, that hardly needs support, if there is no, has happened to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemic of cholera sweeps the country and more than a million of the survivors of the earthquake continues to live in Stores, it was hoped that a huge abstention.
Now the time, many Haitians wanted vote, but not achieved to do so owing to a lack of organization.
About 250.000 identity documents, necessary to vote, still had not been distributed shortly before the elections.
There is much at stake.
Donors of aid consider that the election of a popular Government and legitimate is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has been acknowledged, also think of the Haitians themselves.
Forging of tiptoe towards the centre
In the weeks that have passed since lost their husband, Cristina Fernandez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy between the public which has increased its incidence of popularity in 20 points, to more than 50 per cent, the highest level that has been since his election in 2007.
Despite all, that can convert in a successful campaign for a second term in the elections of next year will depend on whether the clearly affected mr Fernandez leaving aside the intransigence of its late husband, its predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
The mr Kirchner, that age was becoming charge of economic policy even after his wife is happen as chairman, had the habit of producing budgets that underestimated tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled to marriage presidential spend income additional to their discretion.
In theory, the Government of the mr Fernandez lost its majority in Congress the past year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened following the death of Kirchner a result of an attack heart on October 27th.
Some members discrepant of movement Peronist in power we have faced the mr Fernandez.
However, after a chaotic the session in a Member I gave a punch to another in the face and other Members accused the government of using bribery, the Congress decided reject the budget of 2011.
"Am not going to discuss," said the president.
The budget for 2010, accordingly, be implemented at next year, which will offer to the president a margin of manoeuvre still more to the time of spend.
The economy is improving considerably: probably rise to a 9 this year.
The rate of inflation officer is currently in the 11,1%, but many calculations private, in addition to the demands wage of trade unions, put the nearly 30 per cent.
The mr Kirchner, which took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of collapse economic, made to the growth and poverty reduction were their priorities, in place to control inflation.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, was the private sector and was that the INDEC, the institute of statistical, adapt official statistics of inflation.
Moderate now the president Fernandez these policies?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of trade unions.
In addition, their officials say that they want to restrict the wage increases over the coming year to 18.
The economy has been driven by high prices of agricultural exports Argentina in the world.
However, inflation has limited the impetus to growth achieved with a great devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernandez is being just want restore the financial links of Argentina with the rest of the world.
To formation of the year, the Government reached an agreement with the heads of bonds that had been denied to a prior mandatory restructuring of debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, think that Mrs Fernandez is about to conclude an agreement with Governments creditors clusters in the Paris Club, to be around 6.700 million.
The Kirchner always emphasized that this does not mean the supervision of IMF, as is often usual.
However, the past month Beloved Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index at the national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of INDEC.
It is not clear whether the President Fernandez wants to remain in politics when to end its mandate, bearing in mind that is no longer to her husband to his hand.
If it does, require win the support of the middle class, large part of which has been tired of Kirchner.
When the Argentina return of their holiday summer in March, the wave of sympathy for it will decayed.
If you win other elections, will have to decide by repudiating or not, peacefully, many of the policies of their husband.
The hurray by China
The voters of Taiwan are slowly catching to a kind of union more closely with the continent.
What feels Taiwan on its great brother the other hand the close?
More than 7,5 million voters, 70 per cent of the eligible, came on 27 November to elect the Mayors and Councillors of five urban districts in what seems a comprehensive assessment of the President, Ma Ying -jeou.
The same mr Ma has become a defend of the feelings on the continent, building innovative business linkages, including a pact of free trade partial, the greatest changes in relations with China since 1949.
The mr Ma happened the test, but little.
Although his party Kuomintang (KMT) over earn three of the five elections to mayoralty, failed to obtain the majority of votes.
In its place, the Party progressive democratic (PPD), that has been inclined for a total independence of Taiwan, was almost 50 per cent of all the votes face up to 45 of the KMT.
If would become the presidential, the mr Ma it would be in problems.
Since his appointment two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has fallen by around 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in municipalities.
In the elections we could see the typical elements of the elections Taiwan, including noisy trucks campaign and large agglomerations with flags and girls light of Clothing dancing.
Nor Missed the mysterious attempt to murder of rigour.
Are Lien, the child of Lien Chan, president fee of the KMT, doing campaign by one of the candidates of the KMT the night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shot the young person directly to the face, wounding and killing to a transient.
The curious is that it has not been possible to determine if the man was proposing author damage to Lien or revenge of the candidate.
In any case, said Tsai Ing -wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, planting suspicion on the PPD and leading to the voters is bow down by the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
Was surprising that there is no It treats the issue of the continent in itself.
In its place, the candidates spoke of plans of accommodation and public employment creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys their of facto independence and hates the military threat of China.
Therefore, the KMT is to avoid give publicity to its links with the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encourage the feeling against China.
Responds to the new awareness that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For its part, the mr Ma stated that it had confirmed that its policy with regard to China was acceptable to most of the Taiwan.
It is anticipated that the Government of Beijing will bribing with the trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve that Taiwan return to fold.
China is not lost time sending a negotiator in Taipei to prepare a summit on the protection of investments and cooperation medical.
Without doubt, wished to further political integration, but the first is the first.
The best will wait to pass the presidential elections of 2012 for this.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago was a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui -bian, was imprisoned accused of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, instigated openly independence explicit.
However, under the leadership of the mr Tsai, has emerged a new generation of moderates share and the PPD is endeavouring to attract young professionals and.
The mr Tsai has been received pleasantly as Candidate of the PPD for the chairmanship, as His Tseng -chang, that marked mandate under Chen.
Now his party was doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
The mr Tsai announced plans to create a group of experts to serve as a point of contact between the PPD and China, always that can be carried out negotiations without preconditions.
The mr Tsai said the public Taiwan that his party represents a "credible alternative" to precipitate approach of mr Ma with regard to China.
The mr Chen seems angry by the change.
In a statement issued since its cell, stated that the candidates from the PPD would come better unemployed would if insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered to mr His, a pragmatic, not submit to the presidential.
Even without intercede Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulties in choosing between their potential candidates.
The KMT must also be a review of conscience.
The reviews of mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the candidates of the KMT have not wanted to make campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems to be due mainly to unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor.
A spokesperson of the KMT states that restructure his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The major part of the PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, the majority of the Taiwan considers that economic integration with China is inevitable.
As Antonio Chiang, a wellknown columnist, "has already been cross the point of no return."

A microbe resistant to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on earth... or in other places
The discovery of an alien bacteria can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new ways of life on Earth and, possibly, in other planets.
Although the researchers found the strange term bacteria here on earth, say that shows that it is possible to have life without the main elements which considered essential.
"This body has a dual capacity."
"Can grow it is with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That the becomes a very peculiar, but little is needed to be a sort of way of life really alien," commented Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-uthor of the report which appears in the online edition of the Thursday of the magazine Science.
For some time, it considers that there are six major elements essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, the oxygen, phosphorus and the sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow following replace phosphorus on the arsenic.
I "ago plantearte what more is possible," stated Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, co-uthor of the report.
As indicated by Anbar, the discovery is important for the pursuit of life in planets different from the Earth, given to researchers need be able to recognize the lives, to the point that has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered in the Earth.
However, the convening of a press conference to discuss, in which it is not reported details of the discovery, generated a great speculation on the Internet on the possibility that the report indicate the discovery of life alien.
It was.
What the discovery "itself shows is that in other settings planetary, could be agencies to use other elements to promote their biochemical and that the package of elements" pattern "that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell it was part of the investigation team.
"This work is new because it demonstrates the replacement of an element on the other in the biochemical and the structure biochemical basic," added Cockell.
The discovery was not carried out by chance.
Felisa Wolfe -Simon of the institute of astrobiology of the NASA, that addressed the study, focused on the Mono Lake because of high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and phosphorus are similar in terms of chemical, so that speculated that a microbe subjected to both could replace one for other.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because their behaviour chemical is similar to the phosphorus."
"Accordingly, can find it complicated agencies differentiate."
"However, the arsenic it is quite different as for not work as well as phosphorus, on what comes and, to put some way, Cakes the machinery biochemical," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the bacteria wellknown as GFAJ- and the exposed to increased concentrations of arsenic, to be achieved adapt and used to grow.
The microbe is better to phosphorus, but the fact show that can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that can be a natural one way of life that used arsenic, whether in other parts of the Earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Professor ancillary of Wide Web in the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that it can replace the arsenic by phosphorus is not new, but never had been found an example that demonstrate that works.
The arsenic was more common in the first were of the Earth, noted, so that the researchers speculated that the first ways of life can have one used.
"Itself which suggests that could be other means of generating life, not only the way in which life it was in the Earth formerly," indicated Foster, that was not part of the investigation team of Wolfe -Simon.
The investigation was with the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the Institutes National of Health.

The lion is ready to roar again, at the time that the restructuring of MGM achieves the final adoption of the up
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has been finally green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal judge of Bankruptcy of New York formally adopted the plan "preassembled" by creditors to clear approximately 5 billion of debt, preparing the way in which the company of Entertainment of 86 years focus their efforts in the production and feat of movies and television programmes.
The determination of Thursday confirms that the plan complies with the requirements of the code of bankruptcy United, so that there is no other legal obstacles to MGM it relaunch under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that will become the main executive which will be a study by.
The staff it would reduce 400 to approximately 320 member.
In reality, MGM there will of Chapter 11 so that JPMorgan Chase closure an instrument of credit planned to 500 million, to finance the operations and productions of new MGM.
The bank investment is currently syndicating the credit, that by its own is contributing to 75 million, and is expected to be funded in the middle of December.
The process of restructuring of the study started in May 2009, when the bank investment Moelis and Co. was recruited to give advice on the management needed in order to finance, while fighting to be able to make payment of interest for 300 million per year.
In the month of August, the Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in recovery of business in result, known for its work in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial tribulations of MGM and responding to the more than 140 creditors of the study, required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, to the end of 2009 the parties agreed to the company to the out.
However, the auction attracted a few bidders and none prepared to pay the more than 2 billion that they were seeking creditors.
Before the spring of this year, returned the table of design while the team of MGM joined in a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors to the end of October.
When MGM officially out of the bankruptcy in the coming weeks, companies Moelis and Cooper receive subsidies multimillion for their work.
Moelis and Co., that has already been 1.2 million, should be reduced a payment of 9,5 million.
Companies Cooper, that have been raising 375.000 dollars by month for their services to the administration of the company, receive a "fees of success" of 4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan relaunch production in MGM, that released only a film this year, and held a slate annual seven or eight movies that will in 2012.
Also plan cofinancing two movies based on "The Hobbit," together with Warner Bros.
The study requires concerted a loan separate between 265 and 275 million to finance its part of those two movies, that will be addressed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which has approximately 18% of the debt of MGM, had been trying to fix a merger of study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which I is the shareholder largest.
However, the recent talks between the two companies there were in agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gift shop

Considered that the price of a iPad you can buy five Bicycle BMX 99 of dollars each, and a stake Kinect costs the same that 10 String of quantum classic adorned with all, or approximately 48 cans of Play -Doh.
But there are ways of maintaining its budget for gift shop in balance.
Recently visited to three sellers of toys national, Wal -Mart, Toys" R "Us and B's Wholesale Club, to see that toys electronic environment could buy at least 80 United.
It was immediately clear that the Act of Moore has been working; the toy technological of this year probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year'.
In addition, while generally there is less toys new web sites with partners, two of the most known of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And toys driven by batteries of button are increasing, as well as toys with batteries Rechargeable.
Here there are some recommendations.
(all the prices are Toys "R" Us, except that is indicated in another way).
The Sing -to- ma -jigs (Mattel, 13 United, to 3 years and more) are toys Teddy of the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when it squeeze their bellies.

It promotes the one hand more moderate the maintenance of order in China
As a sergeant instructor urban, Tang Shenbin made a step in a place of the city, inspecting with degree to the nerve persons responsible for, emitting orders in voice low with military authority.
I wanted to the its membership of chengguan, the burly officers of the city of China, feared and despised for its vigorous measures capricious and its tilt to violence, communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firm!"
"Attention!"
Show them, whispered, "how are the girl beautiful!"
Four little girls who experienced the children with gloves targets and Jackets green olive identical and pants adjusted to draw the attention.
Four pairs of shoes black perfectly aligned.
Four hats elegant placed perfectly above the hair tied with bows to stripes blue and white.
"Personally, i think that have a appearance normal," said Mr.. Tang, contemptuously.
"Models are cute."
More than a Government has sought to cleaning up the image of the inspectors urban China.
A city ordered that all the new recruits have a title of degree.
The Province of Guangdong changed the political green grayish of the Uniform to a blue alleged more attractive.
Wuhan, in China Central, replaced the use of force by looks intimidating: in 2009, according to a report, 50 official surrounded to a fractious Shopping of snacks, and as noted in the frown gathering consistently over half an hour, so that the seller walking picked their affairs and it left.
Xindu, a district city of 680.000 people in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its police urban 13 women, expressly selected for its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is given to the tosca police one hand more soft, women.
Unfortunately, to Scarlett Johansson should strive to increase the tiny respect of China to these squads of the city.
And for good reason, argue the critical.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed only to fulfil Ordinances of the city, imposing fines and other administrative punishment.
But the means of news Chinese portray routinely a reality different.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Province of Hubei killed to shock to a transient having used its cell to filming while dissolved a protest against a landfill of waste.
The past year, a manual for training for inspectors of Beijing was stolen and published in Internet, in which it described as whip effectively to criminals without them bleed.
This year, a seller walking of watermelons of Shanghai suffered damage cerebral after a brawl with five official.
A game of video full of violence, available to download in line, presented to inspectors trained by the Chinese that attack to sellers street.
"Chengguan has made a scar in the government," it regretted China Daily, a publication national, the past year after a dispute about tactics.
The journal demanded "a cleanup really meticulous."
The Skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district request through a warning eight new recruits female in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women were real duties or were simply a distraction Stage.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
Notice of district requested by candidates female of 18 to 22 years, with a good is "and the five main facial harmonious."
Should have a rise above the average, higher in 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
The withdrawal to the age of 26 years is compulsory.
Staff stated that the work was physically too hard for women with more than 25 years.
"Its image is the important thing," I said a Anonymous official district to Rednet. com, a website quasi governmental.
"First, the skills outside of the candidates will determine whether meet the requirements, as equal, weight, features facial, etc.."
Then comes the temperament "and the skills interior."
The chengguan female are as Vases, said, and it went on to say, "also be Vases, will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy of the office of the administration of the city of district, is not anxious to support this description.
But noted that the demands of equal were standards in many Announcements of work Chinese for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement of features facial harmonious.
If this means be dashing, is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be.
"We cannot allow a person take or a hunchback come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Its image would not well."
Liu Yi, who patrol the Plaza Baoguang close of a monastery, has 22 years, with their cheeks network and discussing a subtly curve.
It does not believe that the accent in his area is sexual, said.
"You think that look sexy with this uniform?" asked with a view sardonic.
Partner its work with dimples, Xu Yang, of 21 years, said "Our work must submit the image of the city."
They also been opposed to its work time determined, said, because harbor ambitions of race greater than simply chase to sellers in the alleys where it is assumed that circumscribe its business.
Every morning, the squadron facing more or less than a dozen of sellers street that it Launch to start or bicycle, trying to sell many muffins or bowls of tofu as possible before cast be.
"Mr Wang, must go."
"I have said many times!" said the Miss Xu while a seller is escaped to start, leaving temporarily their Cart lying by bicycle with fittings of noodles.
The official described their duties as more monotonous that exhausting.
"This is more or less the same every day," said Huang Jing, of 20 years, who are marketing in their hours free.
"Very routine."
One reason is that the official female lack of power of their male counterparts of confiscate the merchandise of the sellers.
Can only threaten to denounce to offenders to their supervisors men.
This tends to protect of the sudden demonstrations public quarrel against bureaucracy, that are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, it rioted then that is ravaged much the false rumor that a formal chengguan had killed a seller.
More than a dozen of police officers or official chengguan were wounded in the episode night; 14 vehicles of government were dumps or pinned fire.
At the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But the calm only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where officials female patrolled this morning, more than 50 people met in a corner.
The commissions had confiscated a motorcycle was still repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, and calls for the regulation.
The master of the bike screaming rudely.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the official, with bad side, it open step in the elbows to their vehicles and they were going quickly with the motorcycle and its master.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator allocated to squadron male, stood behind, with its flagship tide given round to hide their behalf.
As the official female, the coordinators, men 40 years or more, play a role purely support.
Unlike them, not taught to maintain an image elegant.
"Sometimes we are fighting orally."
"Sometimes we are fighting physically," said Mr. Li with total naturalness.
"The greater part of the time is the public which begins the fight."
Prosecutors not rise charges against the Sanader Ensign
The lawyers of Senator announced on Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have acquitted the Sanader John Ensign of the complaints criminals that emerged from its affair with a former assistant campaign and its efforts to ensure that work through lobby for the husband of women.
The decision end with the legal most serious threat facing Ensign, the Republican of Nevada that was seen as possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, so that the scandal on their national affair had headlines in the past year and damaged career.
The office of Ensign said that it was felt it "will be happy" by the decision, that came after an investigation of a full year.
The Senator could still face a disciplinary measure of ethics committee of the Senate.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice we had "informed that the Sanader Ensign is no longer an objective of its investigation and that there is no plan to break charges against him on this subject."
The Department of Justice did not want to make comments on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many lawyers of ethics outside the Department of Justice, who said that seemed be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could be league to be a ban on lobby federal criminal.
The interviews, the email and other documents to be reported first in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of its helpers, to obtain work lucrative through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the affair of Senator with it.
The Hampton Mrs eleven worked as Treasurer a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign was in contact with several political sponsors for find work at Hampton mr and called on behalf of them after it had recruited mr Hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had been recently a assistant of Ensign, was exclude according to the law to lobby for their former employer or the Senate for a year.
The experts in ethics said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, that are friends close before the affair, appeared disagree with the socalled "revolving door lobbying ban," seeks to curtail that former employees state use their links to do business personal.
The evidence has been made public, "seemed be a raw material facie case of a conspiracy to be substantially the statute revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer in Washington that it specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other lawyers of ethics said that the department seemed careful when accept processing political after several setbacks important for its section of public integrity, including the decision of last year to leave the prosecution against the former Sanader Ted Stevens, in the middle of posts for bad behaviour of procedure.
The federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowardly," said Melanie Sloan, chief executive of Citizens to the responsibility and the Ethics in Washington, a group of defence that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This essentially means that the Government staff of high rank now can lead to the laws do not apply to them," added.
Paul Coggins, the main advocate of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a procurator of the Department of Justice on Monday and other socalled over the next, telling that the department not wanted to break charges against his client.
The team of defence of Ensign had been cooperating with prosecutors in the attempted to persuade that the Senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments that is provided to prosecutors.
"I am not convenient entering in detail on my discussions with the Department of Justice, i can only say that we believe that took the decision just," said.
Last month, the Federal Commission for Elections decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint by the group of ethics, that claims that a payment of 96.000 dollars of the parents of Ensign to the Hampton violated the federal law election.
The election commission stated that was not enough evidence to demonstrate that the money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major company of Nevada that had supported for a long time to Senator, which work accomplished by lobby thanks to the aid that Ensign it gave Hampton.
An electronic mail sent in December 2008 showed that after which the company accepted at Hampton as lobbyist, the head of office of Ensign, John Lopez, it was reported with Hampton and I said that I was "crushing" the Ministry of Internal Affairs on a question in dispute.
Ensign also attended a Lunch with Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allegiant Air, and caught in the secretary of transport to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after that had been recruited at Hampton to make lobby.
When for the first appeared the news of the affair the past year, Ensign is requested forgiveness to their voters and renounced its position as fourth leader Republican in the Senate.
After maintain a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told journalists that hung run to a third mandate in the Senate.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer subject to a criminal investigation, said that the Senator hoped that the committee of ethics continue rapidly the example of the Department of Justice and would be concluded its research.
"The Sanader Ensign it wishes to continue with his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," said.
The appeal of Cheshire aim to Twitter
It had average dozen of them "chatting" in the ranks of the Chamber of the court.
Minute by minute, sent reports of the appalling testimony way Twitter.
At the end, said the defence, had more than 140,000 messages of Twitter on the process which addressed the violation and children tied their beds in a house that was lit fire.
On Thursday, the process broadly followed by Steven J. Hayes, who was condemned by the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach a final official, with the imposition of judge of the death penalty voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of mr Hayes have submitted written in the outline up to the arguments of the appeals that it would occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative states that the global reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by journalists media massive, established "an atmosphere of circus," and that saturation widespread and immediate with details enhancers made that the passions they public exercise an influence inappropriate on the jury.
The claims could compel the judges of appeal to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the Chamber of the court.
"According to what experienced during this process, i think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the Chamber of the court is affecting the rights of individual to have a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, main advocate of the defence of mr Hayes.
The court of first instance Jon C. Blue, of the High Court State, rejected laconically the demands in a judgment the week, saying that the media news were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury has been carried out by the passion.
But probably will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, the courts of appeal have been recognized that the coverage of cases celebrities can generate questions on the impartiality of a process.
In a historic judgement of 1966, the Supreme Court of United States revoked the conviction of a osteopath of Cleveland, the doctor Sam Sheppard, for the murder of Mrs, saying in its decision, in the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell, that had "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the programme of television and film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeals which discussed the condemnation of Mr. Hayes half a century later, might feel intrigued by the argument that might be necessary new rules to control the form of communication from the divisions of the court, something inimaginadable at the time of the case of doctor Sheppard.
"There is a general matter of concern on the impact of the new media" in processes of profile high, said John J. Donohue III, a teacher of the College of Laws of Stanford, which explored the death penalty Connecticut and had written a report in which it stated that it was imposed arbitrarily.
The teacher Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigued for the idea that limit the immediate communication from the divisions of the court could make the trials were more fair.
The issue of Twitter is only one of many of the items outlined by lawyers from Hayes, that it probably will be discussed for years, delaying an implementation.
Defence lawyers also say, for example, Hayes that could have been injured when the Judge Blue refused enable them to test the reactions of the juries potential, showing photographs terrifying of the scene of the crime for the selection of the jury.
Some juries have said that were horrified by the photographs of victims, Jennifer Hawke -Petit, of 48 years, and their daughters, Hayley, of 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers say that also will question constitutionality of the death penalty and hold that the judge incorrectly removed to a jury which had criticized for prosecutors, and that incorrectly had Press for a verdict on its bizarre decision of ordering to the jury deliberate for a weekend.
The juries had not been abducted.
But their arguments on the impact of the intensive coverage of the process can attract the bulk of interest.
They noted in a disqualification the verdict filed last month that the case domino the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for candidates for governor and the Senate of United States.
These argued that the media continued cast heated the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily agglomeration of the tweets of the media, chambers and the reporters outside the court," wrote lawyers, "was something ever seen here in New Haven and perhaps in all the state."
Your attention in the coverage of Tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint on the fact that the news immediate were more important that the reports returned more slowly, were a vision Luddite that would be the policy of the court on the control of the coverage was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the courts of appeal is often felt brought into by the arguments on adaptation that were required in the courts owing to the changes social and technological.
Lawyers from Hayes are pressing for such claims.
In its written, referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, that reverses the conviction of the doctor Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, and they gave clear that require that the new media require new rules.
"This case," wrote, "is the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the twentyfirst century."
Can the public spirit providing a bridge to join the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for the invective and the negativity, this week has been unleashed a little public spirit in Washington.
Is a omen of a genuine cooperation two-arty future or a moment illusory before a rapid return to combat party in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress not produced any progress in the big issues that must be treated during the meeting outgoing.
But what they say all, was at least a discussion polite on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities for govern, in time be another episode vacuum to gain points partisan.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the committee of deficit of president was also civilized, despite the political differences that remained among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction during a period of months generated a mutual respect that goes beyond the gap that still an ideological between the members.
That is hardly sufficient to declare that it has reached a new was of cooperation.
Now both parties are in a period of proof, probing another to identify signs of cooperative and commitment, while seeking to assess the limits of the public and the patience of the voters for a renewed war party.
According to which the meeting on Tuesday and the month assessments of the Convention on the part of the participants were made with a minimum of requirements or accusations.
The differences philosophical between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply embedded as to suggest any rapidly changing climate that there during the past two years.
Whether question of taxes, expenditure, care or social assistance, the two parties are in poles conflicting.
In any case, the election of November has smoothing the humor in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way of saying things," said Pete Wehner, a member of the Bush administration now in the centre of Ethics and Public Policy.
"Are inevitable after the elections.
The elections wake passions they party, that then cease.
That is good "
In some issues, in particular in those contained in the agenda of the outgoing meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The tax cuts Bush is expire at the end of year, and nobody is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, of its permanent or temporary.
Similarly, is likely to have a commitment to extend the benefits of unemployment, probably because the Republicans cannot do believe that are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, denied the unemployment benefit for workers unemployed.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, there is greater optimism for a possible agreement on these issues during the meeting outgoing, together with the ratification of the new pact of nuclear disarmament (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty START).
But William Galston, of the Brookings Institution, cautions that the fruitful cooperation in the pressing issues of the outgoing not necessarily meeting will lead to a continuous bipartisanship when the new 112do. Congress meets in January.
Stated, on the contrary, that is very likely and so inevitable, to start a period of opposition.
"After the things that we have to be carried out, in the short term the psychology reverse the situation to one of confrontation" stated.
Also Wehner expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that the public spirit can lead to genuine cooperation.
"See the greater part of what will happen between now and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012," stated.
The reasons have much to do with the constitution of the new majority Republican in the House and the voters of Tea Party, that contributed decisively to its establishment.
For more aware that if the leaders Republicans on the dangers of exaggerate its position, know that must try to fulfil their promises to cut the cost of state and overturn the new bill of health.
Those lines party is now see clearly in the initial reactions with the recommendations of the committee of deficit, which include the reform of the tax code and the increase of some taxes and the retirement age, and the cut of expenditure.
Cochairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to its own assessment, have introduced to force the issue of deficit in the agenda public in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the commission of 18 members to publish its plan as a formal recommendation, and have been strive to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials in the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there, at least at present, few foundations or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the Republicans of the White House and those of the Congress.
The first happen next year in the form of shock support, when the Republicans challenge to Obama on the budget, taxes and the medical, carried out then for a period of greater cooperation bipartisan.
What cause change?
The public.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a standstill, as happened in 1995, then both parties observe with attention the reaction of the people.
Whoever to consider losing probably change course and search commitment.
However, this can be a positive vision.
The partisanship and polarization today are greater than were in the middle of the 1990s, and there seems to be a hollow plane largest among Obama and Republicans of the Congress of which were among the President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in its time.
At the same time, activists both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a choice more compelling in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility that it shows this week can be welcome as many Americans.
But this will require much more effort from both sides to find points in common with the issues that still divided the.
A document from filtering portrays to Moscow and the paradise of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and leaves a part of the bribes and money of protection that revenues directly to the Kremlin, as reported in February the US Embassy in Russia.
It was also reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service great deal systems of blackmail, what helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
These raise money not only to legitimate business, but also of organized criminal groups.
Each stratum bureaucracy, what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "authority vertical," takes its part to extent that the money Upload in the scale.
The note, that was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was issued by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written Yuri Luzhkov while still was more of Moscow, and the blame for large part of corruption.
The President Dmitry Medvedev the dismissed in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, which has an important endeavour of building, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and I has earned several demands for libel on such accusations.
In September, when a television channel Russian I asked on a documentary that suggested that was corrupt, stated: "Is a crazy, a humbug, a nuisance."
According to surveys, the Russians do so overwhelming that its society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained detail, because they were in the report of the Embassy, and is unheard that are diplomats of a foreign country which do that.
"The links direct government of the city of Moscow with the crime has led some to cal's Dysfunctional, and to say that the Government works more as a kleptocracy that as a government " affirms the note.
"The criminal elements have a krysha (a term of the criminal world and the Mafia which literally means" ceiling "or protection) that Leasehold the police, the Federal Service Security (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and Prosecuto's Office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts identifies a structure of three levels in the world I Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are in the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the inspectors corrupt are at the lowest level."
"This is a system ineffective in which the criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS revenues the money of the larger enterprises, and that the police points to the small shops.
A source, stated the report, "explained that the directors commercial Moscow understand that it is best to ensure the protection of the MVD and SFS (in time of the groups organized crime) because they not only have more weapons, resources and power that the groups criminals, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection against criminal gang is not more than a priority."
The note notes that, while collection money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed for a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has confessed that has achieved little progress.
The note by the Embassy informed on men taking Luggage, probably full of money in cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," stated Georgy Satarov, director of the group of experts from Indem in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of the bureaucracy."
"It does not belong to a political class, because no longer exists a political class in Russia."
Without the political, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, stated, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimated that corruption is costs Russia more than 300 billion annually.
In a recent survey on perceptions overall corruption carried out by the NGO Transparency International, the country was Rated in the post 154 (countries are Classifieds of the least to more corrupt).
The disclosure of the note by the US Embassy, that did not happen until late at night time in Moscow, surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and despite that Luzhkov can be guilty by the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin argue that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the documents WikiLeaks could be lies and respond fiercely by a disclosure which it stated that the American diplomats the called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor of policies home in this country," stated.
"But to be honest with you, it can suspect that this be done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, to be done in a way as quite unethical."
The Veterans of the Khmer Reds forced to confront the past
In a classroom concrete weakly lit, with walls stained and shelled, the director of the College Secondary Anlong Veng I recalled the man who had built, the last leader of the Khmer Reds Ta Mok.
"Here all Ta Mok love to."
"I was a good leader and it worried for its people," said Sreng Kor Ma, of 42 years.
Known as "the Butcher" for its brutality for the Government of the Khmer Reds, the commander remains popular in the remote former strength of the Khmer Reds in the Northwest of Cambodia, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Reds it surrender to the government, loyalty sustained by a long time is now finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for the truth and reconciliation is permitted to victims that faced publicly to persons who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a text book of secondary school that for the first time is taught the history of the Khmer Reds to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia released the first sentence of a former member of the Khmer Reds, sentencing the former head of household centre of torture Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years of imprisonment.
With each of these events, the concerns has grown between the Veterans of the Khmer Reds of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to return society Cambodian.
"There resentment and fear among the former Khmer Reds, but they cannot do anything," stated Chhang Youk, director of the Centre of Documentation of Cambodia, an organization independent investigation to the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Reds was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the Government of the Khmer Reds of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of hunger, disease or excess of work, approximately 1.7 million people.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movement that is paid in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary went the guerrilla war since its foundation in mountain and the forests of Cambodia West, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN lead to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of combatants of the Khmer Reds began to defect towards the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had stood, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the near Mountains Dangrek.
Died in an imprisonment of Phnom Penh in 2006 while hoped the process.
Without the support of their benefactors, the most former combatants of the Khmer Reds fell in absolute poverty which is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few officials of elite of the Khmer Reds retained their administrative positions and to return to throw down our its weapons, soldiers Ceilings remain poor farmers and not educated.
"This people has received very few benefits course of the surrender," stated Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, offered by public forums for all of Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have as set out the ideology of agricultural impossible regime."
"Them were servants without any circumstances to do business."
Sister Lim, 55 years, who are joined to the Khmer Reds when it was a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle close Anlong Veng before engaging in life as farmer of rice poor in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Reds was well," stated.
"Ta Mok it gave eating of all."
"But now life is difficult because we have to sel-sufficient "
The current court of the Khmer Reds has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, it is hoped that the court start to prosecute Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, other former minister of the Khmer Reds.
The mandate of the court is prosecute the main leaders and those of greater responsibility for crimes, but has not said if pursue cases in addition to these four.
This is not provided much hoped to fend off the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has focused on Im Chaem, of 64 years, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey for the Government of the Khmer Reds at the end of the years 1970.
In 2007, she told the investigators of the Centre of Documentation of Cambodia which had monitored the construction of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a project in which it intends to have died thousands of workers forced labor.
During a later sultry recent, Im Chaem again of work in the camps to their home on piles of wood in a way of land in the outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw shadows long on the grass dry, Im Chaem refused speak of its past in the Khmer Reds.
She stated that if the court the convene not be presented.
"Cambodia is in peace and stability," stated.
"If there is more processing, will war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, that defected of the Khmer Reds in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court has to more suspects, although the experts and historians the questions.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past" stated.
But with the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move, said Chhang Youk, the centre of documentation.
"Reconciliation, in Khmer, is to join the pieces broken" stated.
"Is our duty meet these pieces broken so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first textbook adopted by the Government on the Khmer Reds, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea," of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the text book history of secondary school the Ministry of Education, that contains less than four pages on the Khmer Reds.
As in most of Cambodia, young people Anlong Veng knows few details on the Khmer Reds, despite the linkage of the city with the regime.
For Valeak, of 19 years, a students in the College Secondary of Anlong Veng, said that the new text book helped students to understand an important part of its history.
But their parents reacted with scepticism when it took the book home to consider.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," stated.
"Them have suspicion because they are not sure about the number of people who process the court."
Such resistance has done that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, stated Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to produce an impact, stated.
In any case, here the Khmer Reds protect charm a powerful.
In the Mountains Dangrek, a path with too many bad herbs and filled of pockets of plastic discarded leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a ceiling rusty of tin.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a huge amount of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, of 31 years, a seller of cellular on the verge of road, stated that i did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But it has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place are there to pray," stated.
Was the Birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day decided go to the place of conclusion of Pol Pot rest, where would a bunch of bananas mature with the hope of having good luck.
Belarus welcomes renounce its pool of qualified uranium in armaments
In a victory surprise to the campaign of President Obama to protect the nuclear materials around the world, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that would relinquish its pool of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treatment was disclosed in a joint statement issued after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Rodham Hillary Clinton would meet with the Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov Belarussian, the scope of a summit of security.
For years, the US Government was trying to persuade to Belarus that resign to its highly enriched uranium and seemed that had reached a point of no return the spring.
But the officials it is said in Washington Post that were carried out a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the past two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium qualified for armaments of an installation of research Belarus.
It prepared the ground for the agreement of Wednesday to withdraw the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, as a member, who spoke from the anonymity due to the confidentiality of the item.
The agreement seemed be one of the most important results of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of 47 countries chaired by Obama in April, that excluded to Belarus.
And I was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former country Soviet to the next summit in 2012.
"Indeed I feel fascinated by the fact that want a place in the Summit on Nuclear Safety 2012."
"This shows that this process is working," stated Ken Luongo, chairman of the Society for the Comprehensive Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a significant step and important" given by Belarus.
In April of 2009 promised Obama in Prague protect all the nuclear material vulnerable throughout the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to weed out all of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on Nuclear Safety of Obama, the Belarussian President, alexander Lukashenko, had stated that the nation never resign to its uranium.
"We preserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kg of what is basically defined uranium in armaments) and the uranium to low enrichment," Lukashenko stated at that time.
"This is our raw material... we are not going to manufacturing dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them anyone."
"The use for research, is all."
However, Belarus is approached to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials affirmed that the first task to withdraw the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly difficult, that the material had been slightly irradiated.

The people would gain 4 seats in Congress and the PSC lose 9
With the results of 28 -N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lerida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase of votes and Members experienced in the recent elections regional, the PP Catalan already has the view put into the overall therefore, has advancement or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this training produced in those elections is bend to which receives in the Catalan.
This, the people Catalan achieved 610.473 votes in the general 2008, while in the regional of 2006, the figure was to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the CFP achieved 384.091 votes.
To keep this upward trend, that has been nourished a transfer of votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, analysts of this training has been estimated that, if it had an general elections, the CFP could move from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress, while CiU win also four (now have 10) and the PSC lose nothing less than 9 Members (has 25).
These calculations would note that the square Catalan is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC lose a Member -now has three- while ICV it would with a deputy win one.
But, to keep the election timetable, quote more immediate will be in May 2011 with the elections municipal, where the people can also be decisive in the end of the Socialist hegemony in the four capitals of province and in its relief the forefront of the Deputation of Barcelona, a administrations that more budget handles -661 million in 2011-.
Both nationalist as popular meet in the possibility that the PSC lost municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lerida and Gerona, where the Socialists will obtain majority or no possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the disaster Republican, would not be wild that this training lose their representation in the Consistory Barcelona -is needed to obtain 5 per cent of the votes-.
The PP has increased the number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lerida and Tarragona.
The nationalist are convinced that star the Tipping in the capital Tarragona, where ruled with the PP before the current more Socialist, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lerida, the PP has been placed only to 500 votes of the PSC, whose more, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy -during the latter campaign, be found in several occasions.

The Cell Catalan facilitated thousands of Passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, in Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistani and the Nigeria arrested by agents of the Police Station SecretaryGeneral on Information of the Police in Barcelona were a cell Jihadist that, addressed since Thailand, facilitated Passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, between them "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author this conclusion of the attacks of Bombay that caused the death to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the apparatus of counterfeiting Al Qaeda to the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity."
Researchers estimates the cell, in the two years that has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of Passports to Thailand, where were counterfeit and then distributed to the groups that constitute the galaxy criminal Al Qaeda to their "combatants" can cross borders European and other Western countries with total impunity.
The Cell destamantelada is not the only to the network Jihadist was operational in Europe, hence that investigations had participated, in addition to the services Thai, other police units European, so that it is not discarded that in the territory of the EU are carried out in the coming days shock similar to the developed in the evening last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with the operation (were arrested the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigeria Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand was held another to capture the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
These were those who on their way in Bangkok the cell seated in Spain and in other European countries.
The network Catalan -part of her oldest one was regularly in 2009- stealing primarily to tourists Passports to meet with the requirements burdened by the socalled "Front Islamic World."
That is, documents should be behalf of boys between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without visas stamped.
By means of research highlights that, of time, it has not found any information that link to the arrested in Catalonia with the offence of Bombay, despite that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving end of the Passports stolen in Spain and then counterfeit in Thailand.
However, noteworthy that day before that were committed the offence, in Catalonia were envoys through an agency of transfers a few thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of cards of mobile that there were used by the representatives of "command" that over to the lives of 106 people.
The Police has been seized of abundant documentation.
The PP required to More that park the concert Prosecutor
The leader of the CFP, Alicia Sanchez -Camacho, took place yesterday of expose personally to Artur More their conditions to support its investiture as chairman of the Generalitat, identical to the already raised during the campaign and that is summarized in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and do away adventures filo- sovereigntists, as is the economic concert to the national leader want to raise in the Ecuador of its mandate.
The president of the people Catalan came meeting the Artur More with the security that would be obtained 18 Members in the elections of last Sunday, figure more than enough to be want, because the candidate CiU requires that at least one of the formations to serve the opposition is refrain in the vote of investiture.
A possible Entente with the PP are the future partnerships that the nationalist want to maintain in the Congress when it held general elections, but, of time, the talks that these days maintains More with the rest of political leaders are underway in key Catalan.
And in regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "to be parking all the speeches sovereigntists and independence," as well as the concert economic -similar to the Basque Country- that the leader convergent aim even put a referendum.
Both leaders themselves have in common their bet on thin the political apparatus of an administration autonomic very inflated and the elimination of tax of Inheritance and donations.
The details of the negotiations on the investiture of More it would occupy, on the part of the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
More has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) -that promised an opposition is-, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today we will do with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidarity Catalan).
The geriatric states that the deaths were not for "lack of measures"
The directors of the centre of Olot not discarded that its watchman kill to more than 11 elderly
The responsibility of geriatric The Caritat of Olot (Gerona) were yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage it has led to the institution the conduct criminal Joan Vila Dilme, the nurse that while there was killed employee at least eleven elderly who was responsible for.
The director of the residence, Joan Room, I was presented accompanied by lawyer of the Centre, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the wish of the Caritat would be able to the accusation against the responsible" of deaths but "the legality and the responsibility have forced us to take the situation procedures of responsible civil."
And it is also of social discredit that can suffer the entity not to be detected in time the criminal activities of watchman, the major threat to Caritat now a new form of substantial compensation which are already calculated legal representatives of the relatives of victims.
Joan Vila Dilme has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then there has been made to kill.
The judge underlined in the auto that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies -old beneficiaries of geriatric- that suspected that in many cases no doctor explored personally to the Deceased but that, in response to the age and the pathologies of patients, it dispatched the stage for telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, denied yesterday emphatically this point and said that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what has happened."
The lawyer of The Caritat added that "in the case there is a sign that there has been an action unwise on the part of any other person who is not the same allocated."
The already baptized as "Angel of the Death" confessed day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that the first crime the committed on August 29th, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case led the death prick a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that committed helping of a mixture of pills sedatives.
The director of a Caritat notes that it is difficult to control that the staff of the Centre have access to medicines.
The puncture of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the internal, used to give death.
But it will be the analysis that we are doing in the laboratory which should clarify whether Vila not lies and sought to their first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, the burned for within giving bleach as has already confessed that made with the three women killed between 12 and October 17th.
In The Caritat not give credibility to the manifestations of watchman, or even the number of murders confessed, not discarded to be higher, and justify its attitude in the different versions which has given Vila in their visits to the tried and in the little sense that it has to change their way to proceed having committed, with success, eight murders.
That is why we say available to the justice system to clarify the scope of this procedure.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat yesterday of Trichet that warned "markets must not underestimate our ability to react."
The differential of peripherals have closed with force and the actions of European banks have uploaded more than 5 per cent.
However, nor should we underestimate the capacity of the ECB to be and the euro barely has picked which is a sign of concern.
What happened yesterday is inherent to a market illiquid that as comes crumbling down this recovers but are given for closure of positions short and very speculative.
The institutional investor take in lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB is quoted today to withdraw measures of liquidity and it will have to recant morning by fourth time in two years and those that are.
The Bundesbank required to finalize the plan to purchase of public debt by inefficient and eliminate all measures extraordinary liquidity to run and becoming just unlimited access to week.
Following the Irish crisis we hope that extended measures of liquidity current "at least until March" and maintain the auction quarterly with unlimited access to the end of term to ensure that the liquidity at least until June.
We also expect to continue with its programme of the purchase of bonds and even to give the signal intensify.
If not meet the expectations generated revert the excellent way of markets yesterday and if they stubborn to withdraw measures of liquidity, that God we attending!
As in its meeting in May in which affirmed that had not even referred the purchase of bonds and collapsed markets, morning could be replicated the history.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday said that I had already bought much, leading a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of Lyrics to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million to 5,28%, versus 750 million to 4,81% of the auction previous.
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has been made public figures of hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated numbers are some 10,000 million in the short term and other 15,000 potential and have until February to attract private capital or would make nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after does not recognise the problem in July with the test of stress, the figures are assumable within the plan of assistance and help to reduce the uncertainty.
However, the next Tuesday, the Government will have to get the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still is not sufficient support, so that Ireland is still a focal point of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has been mitigated the tone of your speech to relax tension in relation to the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th in which there is a political commitment to show that we are a union and that all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants play to Wagner and the rest the anthem really the joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the President had the gift of the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of action adopted on Friday the Council of Ministers.
Reform of pension, transparency in the autonomous communities and entities financial, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in ears of the investors as the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explained that the Bag Spanish have uploaded the 4,5%, the double that the rest of Bags European.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and vigorous and we are benefiting of fact surprise.
Today there is an auction key to a bonus to three years that we will see benefit to the effect Trichet for what we expect to be resolved with strong demand and will help dispel the doubts about our ability to refinancing.
For Spain ask a plan of assistance would be a self-mmolation.
We would a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than 40 billion in liquidity available the threefold that in March, to types expensive and I is access to markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain the women of Caesar, "also be appropriate, seem so."
, spirit we.

Network Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since Network Bull burst in the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of the speed has been marked by surprise and to the success.
In the first time no one took into account the options of a team new arrival and, in spite of the record ascending of the latest seasonal, last November, in the final stretch of Championship all bet for the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without detract the ability as a pilot of finally champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the capacity of engine Renault that propels his car, in the world of the Formula 1 has become a Legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into hands Bull Network for convert in a team winner.
It is in fact a powerful software of simulation of processes that the German highlighted in the market in 2007 with the purpose very away of the high car race.
Calls PLM, this powerful instrument software has been used for designing chains of assembly of factories manufacturing throughout the world, power plants, instruments of high precision.
The aim is play, simulate remain true to form the product or process before build of its real, avoiding in this way mistakes and expenditure preventable.
PLM has facilitated the development of the chambers photo of Canon, of the operation of Sukhoi or cars utility more famous of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the division industrial Siemens, explained that the use of this software tool in its factory of Formula 1 has enabled to Network Bull design and put into effect "in few hours, practically in real time," modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during the careers and in the test.
Russwurm explained that the teams in the 1992 had an average of 10 in its technical team that were able to introduces a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles for each season.
In the team of Network Bull working today 180 youth professionals high qualification that, equipped with powerful computer equipment, discussed and project any chance of changes in the Fireball.
The steering of Siemens explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all the elements of the Fireball of Network Bull with exception of motor, that is the whole responsibility of Renault.
This change materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the elements of security.
The changes that may lead to the virtual reality of simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, with advanced systems of production through Laser and autoclaves of high technology.
As only limitation of this madness of advanced technology is the figure of $40 million that each team of Formula may 1st spend a maximum of each season to facilitate competition.
Network Bull has mounted the work establishment of high technology for designing and producing their Fireball in a location for approximately 50 kilometres of London.
It is two buildings in which they are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that there happens is considered "high secret."
The staffing for this mission is EUR 580 people, including its two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 of the Network Bull, without doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense resources technological that the mark of beverages energy has shown in the service of their participation in circuits, territory they are hiding other actors whose participation is invaluable and its visibility nonexistent.
The head of technology in the work establishment, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago we could say that the progress I+D in the cars of carts contributed 50 per cent of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology amount 85 per cent of success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by information that "are gladiators unpredictable."

Sabadell bet for stealing a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than others managers, the advisor delegate Bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking, but discarded initially a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war of passive.
Despite this, provides a collapse the margins untouched of interest, that it attempt compensated in hand with increases of commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expected capture in three years a million clients individuals, their piece of unfinished business.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and it can survive in an economic environment very complicated.
The bank to be launched in 2011 a new plan director will have a duration of three years.
The objective, in addition to survive without need for recourse to public aid of Frob, is gain market share with the uptake of a million new clients individuals -00.000 if it discounted those who can break the bank-, its major piece of unfinished business, because until now had spoiled more to the SMEs and enterprises that the client retail.
This year has captured 250.000 clients individuals and 50,000 businesses.
Its share of market in particular is of 3.5 per cent, while in company exceeds 10 per cent.
Another of the foundations of the plan 2011-013 is based on the productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with reduction of costs as objective, and these challenges the expose the bank when drafting the results of the exercise.
Few banks dared in these times to set goals and them public because the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the global banking.
Sabadell, in fact, close this year its plan director Optima, set for four years, although initially was for three, but the situation of the markets so that they extend an exercise more.
Customers who leave escape the savings will be its main objective.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a year "difficult and fundamental."
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
In addition, in two or three years will be "very difficult to create employment," central to the survival of business banking, insisted.
And, but believed that the war of passive -that penalizes the margins untouched- is declining, the price premiums risk that they are paying banks and boxes for their emissions for obtaining liquidity are moving because the price of credit compensated for the fall of the margins untouched.
"The subject of liquidity and the structural funding is, and will be a factor of pressure on the credit."
"Not have closed the tap, but the differential are higher," recognized Guardiola.
Banesto already provided on Thursday orders to its network to limit the appropriations in the long term and rise the price of the differential -see CincoDias of 22 and 27 November-.
It also recognized that the trend of the banking now "is to raise commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of Sabadell is based on the growth organic, although, as always, the group does not rule out operations Corporate.
Not in vain, ensured that in Spain "we are going to require sizes greater."
"The next year is going to move around," had assured him.
Affirms that the needs of capital are "uploaded deal" and does not rule out that any financial entity Spanish between the numbers red.
And notes that the Frob can supply the market in the uptake of funds to new recapitalizations.
After ensure that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, subtracted importance to what some bankers predict it as a new liquidity crisis.
Notes that it can deliver, but quite the opposite of what happened in June, it can obtain funding for the short term through repos, what cushions the crisis.

"I believe that the largest part of mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol the group of Banking Civic we cannot say that it is a second round, what we are adjustments."
"The most part is completely made; may be in place by 17 we are to 13 or 14 but all the major processes have been done already and protected by the Bank of Spain, that this has cooperated enormously also," said the steering.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executives and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has been subjected to the process of concentration is rushing "to the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very pleased to as it is taking place in the deadlines that in its day, not now, it marked in the plans of business with the Bank of Spain," emphasized.
"Move from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million volume of assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no parallel in the history, reduced the number of entities in 62% to be much larger in order to comply with Basel," underscored.
Olave recognized that "there are a number of views precious little Lucky about the slow process" to show "a lack of seriousness and respect," because "what the Bank of Spain is remember that we have to be within the time before the end of year."
The director general of the ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, had assured him yesterday that Spain has the financial system more rigorous throughout Europe and "probably" of the world, and attributed whom the individual in question a "lack of knowledge."
The steering said that, within the current economic situation, "can be very quiet" with the situation of financial institutions and the insurance funds savings, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "important" and that "is the greatest possible speed."
Also I recalled that the banking Spanish appeared very well waystation of evidence to stress that was the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the bottom line German
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the entire European.
Tensions in the markets have led to a twofold response governmental.
On the one hand, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has progressed further measures of adjustment, from tax cuts to the SMEs, regulation of agencies private placement or abolition of the 426 EUR to help unemployed without provision, to the privatization of (49 of AENA, of the management of airports of Barajas and The Prat and 30 per cent of Lotteries of State.
On another, the vicePresident Elena Salgado, with the support of president Felipe Gonzalez, has been added to the critical to the Chancellor Angela Merkel for their responsibility in loose the current crisis.
How can we interpret these movements?
Going ahead that the position of Merkel is not a mistake in its policy communicative.
On the contrary, is another round of nut in the difficult process of redefining of the euro.
And that Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, that hits with the maintain the longstanding traditions of good part of its partners.
Faced with the resistance European, in Germany began to speculate on the three possible outputs to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated at the same, Austria and Netherlands, between other countries, while the south leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now like science fiction, with a common opinion very favourable, close to 50 per cent of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals Germanic greater control macroeconomic, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries offenders, possible suspensions of payments of any of them and extension the private sector the cost of adjustments potential.
The German position is clear and has defined long, so far is no apology.
First, in the 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government is took of the manga a constitutional reform for prevent them as from 2,016.
This was the first sign of disagreement between what Germany believed that should be (plans of fiscal stringency and stability in public finances), and what were practicing its European partners, including France.
The second in the front the gave the country Central when Merkel reached painfully the decision of rescue of Greece.
Since then was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public and published were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in recent days October, of new Merkel is emerging and with it a clear position, require the reform of the treaties of the European, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing the private Lenders to take on the part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-uropean, that has precipitate the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat Sweetened, has been adopted and, in the coming months, should attend to the process of reform of the European Union that enable those measures as of 2013.
Germany has drawn a bottom line which does not cross.
And we are saying to all that, although we now have to take action with those that perhaps it is not very much agree, from one day the old functioning of the euro, it would be completed.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new area monetary, in which countries offenders will be severely sanctioned, may be obliged to declared in suspension of payments and, in this case, the private sector also be provided with part of the cost.
Germany we are drawing attention that we must remain a severe path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, restraint in the consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances positive.
Alternative based on debt and the construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, as it has chaired the Spanish growth in the boom years of, simply not going to tolerate.
The stake is clear.
And we would wrong in not be understood.
It is not only of redirect the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we require is much more hard.
And what is worse than in these circumstances we could do is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence leave step to a greater tranquility.
And to build the window of opportunity that we have been, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero also has understood this and its two points (reforms promised following the meeting last Saturday with the large companies and the announcement yesterday new measures) suggested that, despite the criticism Merkel, has been opened up the thesis that we need to order at home.
But the bottom line that Germany has mapped out there is, and not think that are going to move.
And, between the potential to be covered, the leave a monetary area too packed countries little serious, cannot excluded.
Then, Germany always we can say that we already had informed.
Sport and fraud of law
Tricks as those of Alonso and Ramos to the Ajax show wit but will to escape to a sanction.
The expulsion allegedly Warping by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party disputed on 23 November against the Ajax in the League of Champions has led to be write rivers of ink about if such behaviour is or not unsportsmanlike and if, possibly, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, to lack of a few minutes to stop the party (that your team had already clearly won), the two players lost deliberately time to time to draw paths faults to encourage that the arbitrator they show the second card yellow.
In that way, and because as the Real Madrid end as leader of his group, both players be turning the sanction regulatory the next party of the league, against the Auxerre, and may move clean of cards to the next phase.
Finally, the committee of discipline of UEFA has sanctioned with two parties to coach of equipment, Jose Mourinho, and with different amounts to the economic players involved.
The provocation of a card yellow in circumstances such as this or similar is not a practice new, but more prevalent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that form part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case told that is because it has been starring by a team of the entity of the Real Madrid (that in its anthem really presumed of nobility and honour, and that in times past has fined their players for acts existed) and the dramatization orchestrated, to be, by Mourinho, that adds a episode more to their dilated history of technical histrionic and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibited by the regulation runs counter to the principles of sport, is to say, if with these actions are commits fraud of law; therefore, in effect, are actions friendly with the rules Sports, but seem escape their sense.
The issue is going to discuss the type of damage that lead to the spirit Sports.
One of the goods that includes the spirit Sports is the physical integrity of the players who, aspect that with these actions are not placed in jeopardy, is to say, there was no stake violent.
Another of these assets to which it refers to the fair game is to avoid that the team of the players offenders will take of an unjust way of equipment contrary, thing that it was.
However, the paradoxical of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it is not settled to what usually characterize as trap or fraud of law, because its violation of rules was not to hidden to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely its action was to be the most obvious way to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
Them expected and accepted gladly the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage obtained offenders in the faults intentioned discussed.
Here we find it necessary to establish that it is not placed in disadvantage to rival or are derived benefit in the same party, therefore clearly the result of the action is allowed to own team with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next party, because the club will not be able to rely on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players begin the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is an advantage in the long term, with a degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated in the first change, and in addition to this action the players are a party of sanction and spend the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occur with a less than in the first cycle.
In a way that, to be happening rounds, is not so clear that it is an advantage.
In conclusion, these actions will not go against the spirit Sports, of that its part to make strategic decisions that favor to the maximum advantage of that allow the rules.
In the course before us, the players acted not to shirk the implementation of the sanction (that it would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when submit to it.
Took a strategic decision without draw the punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between the wit and fraud of law is diffuse, on this occasion I believe that it was a clear case of wit.
The dispute, it seems to me, grows by two factors: because it was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which it conducted the transmission of the guideline of provoke.
The damage caused to the principles of sport for these actions is not so much an ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive of offers to capture the dinner Christmas of groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the timetable concentrated this year a avalanche of reservations to the 16 and 17.
Proliferate the Celebrations autosufragadas for employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 EUR.

As is happening in the 2008, when it began the stage of cows skinny, are many companies that have removed the dinner collective on budgetary matter.
In order not to do without the tradition, many workers the continue paying their own pocket.
Whatever the current, some other demand and prices of battle, confirms the chairman of the Guild of Restauracio of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.

The business will well "to provide good quality price and with good service," added, and recalls that the clients are more likely to fall a step with the crisis, so that the strip on the 25 EUR has become majority in the demand.
In a survey in various settings central it has identified the breakdown of requests for the night of 17.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of applications for this Friday, with the France of spending less than 30 EUR, to what we have responded adapted its menus to the current, with formulas complete of 25 to 35 EUR.
In other groups more powerful, Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostel of the Rita, Market, The Inn and other), the special character of the timetable has led more reservation early, even in early November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the same price of last year, with menus for all the tastes since 19,95 to EUR 30," detailed.
In AN Grup, that flag The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and to a total of 23 local, are optimistic after identify an increase of invoicing einvoicing since the second half and a good, although concentrated, prospects of business for the Christmas.
Sources of the Group highlighted that the 18 will also be a day hyperactive at groups of friends that precelebran the parties.
To its six menus group have been added one Christmas, with the EUR 30 or more as a star budget and the perception that there predisposition to spend 10 per cent over the past year to change call for more details, as cava.
Also see outbreaks Green in some companies to go back to invite to their employees and impression that the volume of the groups is something more.
On the part of employers Fecasarm (that includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its VicePresident, Enric Gomà, hoped to begin to see the end of the tunnel and affirms that all reservations are "animated," although the clients "negotiate the maximum."
That itself, the illusion for the celebrations has not declined, pay who pay, indicates.
The nuclear programme Pakistani creates great concern to States dollars
Islamabad produces weapons fissile to "a rate faster than any other country."
The leaks of Wikileaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State of dollars filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirms the huge concerns that leads in Washington the nuclear programme Pakistani.
The scope of the enlightening and juicy details provided on the content of the talks and the thoughts of diplomats Americans accredited in Islamabad, documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in terms of security atomic, in time to go to increase, "decreases," and that the unstable country Asia produces nuclear weapons "at a rate faster than any other country of the world."
The particularity of nuclear programme Pakistani -that weapons are not assembled but remaining stored by components to hamper their destruction in case of attack- -is one of the main reasons for sleeplessness in Washington.
So lists the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit by then advisor for National Security, James Jones: "The subsidiarity of some nuclear facilities in territory under attack Taliban, the rumored spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transport of material atomic."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and in the missile programmes is referred, already not only by States dollars, but also by Russia, as proliferative and reason for keeping the guard.
"Pakistan has had to engage staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of the educational levels and cultural, extreme organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in the nuclear programmes or of missiles," said the expert Yuri Korolev, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Russian, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The most new of documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is becoming less cooperation between States dollars and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the high rate Pakistani of production of nuclear weapons.
A desk of the Embassy in May, be seen in "frustrating" communication with Pakistan, sustained: "The transparency is frequently nonexistent; the offers of assistance remained unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, member of the National Intelligence for South Asia, has identified that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a rate faster than any other country of the world."
The ambassador Patterson also requested to Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" the responsibility that "the Army of Pakistan must stop with the support tacit to terrorist groups."
The Hunting of the head of Wikileaks
Obama appointed a high responsibility of the fight against terrorism to prevent new leaks.
Interpol picked up an alert to the bottom end to the movements and locate to Assange where is.
Everything relating Wikileaks and its founding, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts.
Yesterday INTERPOL issued a "alert bottom" to "locate and to the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not an arrest warrant traditional.
In addition, is not new, but dates of 20 November.
And it has to do with the last filtration of more than a quarter of a million of documents diplomatic of dollars but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of operator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensured that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Was the day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in Lyon (France) delivered to the request of Sweden, but not revealed so yesterday, after receiving authorisation of the authorities of that country.
So things, the 188 countries of INTERPOL are indications of identification or locate to Assange "with a view to its provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a ship bottom, many of the Member States, as has explained the organization, it considers the socalled network notice free hand to come to an arrest - must tackle the body of national police - especially if they have a bilateral agreement on extradition, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that is Assange.
The movement has indignant to lawyers of Assange, that yesterday published a letter denouncing that the founding of Wikileaks, of 39 years, has been willing to respond to videoconferencing to the questions of the authorities Swedish.
Remember too that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden taxation of his case, that compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Beria Pavlovich, head of security of Stalin.
"This seems a hunting, persecution not a legal," complaint the missive.
While the world it is seeking -and from Australia mother defends the innocence of his are- -Assange remains in whereabouts unknown, but not silent.
On Monday gave from one place undetermined an interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a discussion in which requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of dollars, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can show that was responsible in order to diplomats Americans that spy in the UN to violate international treaties USA has signed, should resign," said.
The view was reviled yesterday by the Registrar of the press of the White House, Robert Gibbs, that called of "absurd and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not entirely sure why we must importing the opinion of any kind with a web page," stated in the chain CNN.
The same Obama has commissioned a high responsibility of the fight against terrorism, Russell Travers, to prevent new leakage of documents.
The attempt by the spokesperson of the president Barack Obama to play down Assange contrasts with views that these days claim political and commentators Conservatives.
Peter King, the congressman that from January chairman the Committee of National Security in the lower house, has asked the Department of State to explore the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and its funds and persecute any which are of any contribution or assistance."
Further still has gone Tom Flanagan, an advisor of president canadian Stephen Harper, that has had to retract after say that Assange should "be murdered."
"Obama should convert on objective and using a plane not manned or something."
That is not apologized was Mike Huckabee, minister Baptist, former governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
"Who is in the Government which filtered information is guilty of betrayal and anything that is not the execution would be a punishment too kind," stated in the chain Fox.
Puigcercos seeks peace in the ERC with Winks to the related to Carod
The leader Republican will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes an executive more plural and the end of the system asambleario.
Joan Puigcercos seems to be found the recipe for draw the umpteenth internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without north by the loss of 11 members and half of the votes.
The President of the party is aware that its hint of resignation it is not enough for the related to former leader Josep Lluis Carod -Rovira, but also know that the influence of this sector is today so diluted as its own mentor and that in all it can cause the headaches which had with other extinct flows.
That is why, the leader of Esquerra seek to win the new critical to Winks that will allow shield to the municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercos announced yesterday that the more than 200 advisors of national ERC will be able to take a stand on its continuity in secret.
Through ballots, and not to hand appeal.
If the Carod want vehicular a vote of punishment the President, will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of ranks wants to avoid the perception of division as much as the submission to his person.
In several interviews, stated that it should not be regarded as ratified by half over one of the votes, but added, without refine percentages, that it would be good a result "to the Bulgarian."
The next Carod to ask the President more than make its position available to the militancy, a gesture which does not apply when Puigcercos monitor the highest body between congresses.
But to not have the majority sufficient to force resignations, going to try to agree on with the executive a road map next May.
For this, expect to participate in the preparation of document strategic reorientation that the direction be submitted for vote by national Council the day 18.
Its aim is endorse to Puigcercos to change that this promise advance the congress to fall by 2011, something that the top already taken for granted.
The leader of ERC recognized that the "polyphony" works stability and that its objective is to do that, eleven and for all, the organization is capable of wash the rags dirty of doors to within.
In this vein, is emblematic the article that the Councillor in place Josep Huguet signed in your Blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercos, the holder of Innovation was in fact that the leader will be endorsed "to change of various objectives."
And identified five, of the following two.
The first, "reset" the executive to represents at least to 90 per cent of the militancy, is to say, include costly new come that sector related to Carod.
The second may be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquide eleven the assembly system as a mechanism of operation.
This, is all about a reform of the statutes that allowed to hold the congresses through delegates elected by vote.
An end to the model asambleario, an exception in the system of parties Spanish, has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercos, already struggled in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsed conclave of 2008 gave the entrusted to the direction of revising the assembly system in a congress specific of reform of regulations.
This appointment is still pending, because the white internal recent years discouraged address the issue.
Now, without areas critical to ambush, can be a good time for retake and try to close for all.

The infectious diseases emerges convinced: "patience is not my strong, may be my sore."
At the end, course of a frustrated rapprochement with the orthopedic that it has stolen the encouragement in half of corridor, but who is clear that sore is not an end scientific; is the psychoanalyst who finds the mystery: "the sore is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The player sighed relieved and concluded "of the sore only I managed know that it is the real open and that there is no," but convinced that the pleasures and the pitfalls of the language should be very interspersed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also outlined a delightful narrative that titled Praise of the invention, where the finger at the sore is not Names but at a time it view.
With strokes of realism magic, account of a famous sorceress, that the same played clouds, brought back to men had gone away or repaired the virtues that have lost a maiden, narrative that turned to speak then America, the great novel to which it is not lacking from the outset their own chroniclers that the tell and quoted in Bernal Diaz of Castillo that criticism the excesses it from Captains by the conquistadores.
"Cervantes that we invented all (the writers) made mockery of witnesses sham that appeared in the stories presented as a real, but another way is never have come to be the history of America with imagination to which it lacked to the modesty."
However, stressed "it is the insane and the liars the best imagine" and this is where converges reality and lie, where it knows that the narrated belongs to a side or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
It draws in fact the "tradition Cervantes.
"For his legacy we are what counts."
In its turn, the writer Mayra Montero he said and applauded the variety of interpretations to that took place the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the sore.

The evening the closed the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero whose intervention also made emphasis "of the finger on the writer committed by writer."
Considered that in a world that live in hurry, also in the customs intellectual and control of the consciences that is in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every assertion is not a small and behind each denial is a small but."
"To be directors of our thought and be directors of the reality is that qualify: and qualify means many times to put the finger at the sore and hurt to those that are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, the ideas set out and without hue and hurt also to the powers that preferred a world in black and white," said, inviting to recover the notion of writing.
Roman is by its first title
Ruben Omar Romano account with three defeats in the end, has witnessed ups and downs in their career, but has known to it three times the number decisive.
With the mourning of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, also facing two different styles burdened by its technical, those who are among themselves with a marked contrast to the results.
Ruben Omar Romano account with three defeats in the end, has witnessed ups and downs in their career, but has known to it three times the number decisive, although until now it has become white and this is why this occasion is very particular to him.
The Argentina has completed comforting with the story of runner-p, it has been a retrograde step of the winners and curiously with the same team has played the end consecutive.
The strategist Santos reached its first end as coach in the Tournament Opening 2002, when was full responsibility of Morelia with which fell by overall 4- to Toluca; subsequently, in the Closing 2003 also came to mourning decisive and also lost with overall -1 and was precisely to Rayados.
As with Santos Laguna, in the Tournament Bicentennial 2010, again before the Devils, Ruben again undergo a setback, because his team completed tied 2- to the chorizo following 210 minutes to play, but in the series of Penalties was to advantage by -1 with two opportunities for seal the title to finally three players adopt failed since the 11 steps and suffered the somersault 4-.
Ruben already lost two end with the Devils Reds and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not take the same fate, seeks discard of hex and power celebrate for the first time a title, although I said that for it is the most important institution.
"I want to escape champion, not want to break any statistics, this is in a club, for a hobby to which I have and as a result comes the title for my, but the above is the most important," commented the helmsman when it called into question about the numbers that is against playing the end.
Very valid has the final previous, which, ensured, has learned much, "the only teaching that we can have is that so that the arbitrator whistle the end we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, players too, because the last time, with two criminal for pull as we were prepared to escape running and I believe that this is a teaching, to that end the party can celebrate."
Knowing that this number could be defined in shots criminal, something that it is not restless, therefore trust in their players: "One never designed to reach the series of criminal, one seeks to finish on time to regulate, but sometimes there is another and we must be prepared, in the previous tournament were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad play the fate, sometimes by the nerves or the concerns of bear the title in the hands, but we was, that I left something to this end that we do not come to that end."
Roman has in its hands must be a technical runner-p and try for the first time the glory to provide titles.

May fought against illegal migration without problems
The draft law of the conservatives that, according to the Government, should address the problem of the boats charged of clandestine migrants, surely will face a major opposition, because the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that could not stand for it.
"I spleen mainly in the Charter."
"I stand here with a party that has created the granite that you step," declared the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded Members after the holding of the meeting Weekly of the caucus.
The Liberals defend that the draft law in its current form, that would be up to one year to any person appropriate of a ship identified as transport of clandestine immigrants, breaks the Charter canadian rights and freedoms.
The leader of Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, indicated that it could not support the draft law because points to the wrong target.
"We are against and, allegedly, all the opposition parties are against the draft, so that we shall see what the Government," stated Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in the field of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected a stroke of the pen the criticism that pointing out that his party is not strong enough to clandestine immigrants.

The new unit no unanimity is required
Despite that it had announced the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, many observers are calling for the establishment of a committee of public consultation on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York is question since January of last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unity against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement of Tuesday has caught by surprise to more than one.
We can say that, during a meeting of the Council permanent on the police services of Quebec on the past October 29th, ever been discussed this measure despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was sufficient to the critical of the party Quebec that is the question of the public security, Stephane Bergeron, categorizing this announcement as "a rabbit brought to the hat" and as "a solution sloppy of last time."
The Minister Dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"Will see the results when it announce," indicates simply.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace the launching of a survey public.
"The more it persists Mr. Charest in order to avoid the creation of this committee of inquiry, more people shares our opinion, is to say, that has something to hide," explained.
"The only way to provide a committee of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, teacher of ethics and governance of the College of national public administration.
To break this deadlock, suggested in Quebec to make a special mandate to controller general to conduct a survey on the collusion and corruption.
"Must be able to extend the mandate of controller general," thus concluded.
It also, considers that Quebec could give to controller the same powers as a commissioner, allowing thus forcing people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent gang is not the only project fledgling in the Government Charest.
Quebec is also in Ottawa to replace the Criminal Code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request it appears from the Prosecutor of the operation Marteau, that has reported to the Minister of Justice Jean -Marc Fournier that the law is not explicit on this type of research.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has been confirmed by its part to its counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, preference is now to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the operation Spring 2001 in connection with the groups of bikers, although it is not had served the Criminal Code, were arrested 131 persons.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed the adoption of the Act on the gangsterism.

450 million in contracts and tenders
Hydro -Quebec has granted direct contracts with a value of 450 million to enterprises of engineering for the project hydroelectric Eastmai-1 -A- Sarcelle -Rupert.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, that has been achieved without a tend advance the contract more important, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energie gerance, was established in 2004 as a result of the decision of -Hydro Quebec of confidence in the private sector its responsibility to manage this important project hydroelectric 5,000 million.
In early 2005, the consortium Energie gerance obtained the lucrative contract without which it undertake earlier a bidding.
For the Party Quebec, the resort to consortia of enterprises poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and bring about a rise in prices.
"It is a new method of collusion and eliminate competition."
"Is to say, the people, in place to do so in secret, now do so openly," stated yesterday the Member of the Party Quebec Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier, morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, as stated, not understand how it can benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister for Natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded to the late, denied strongly that it has been a collusion with this contract.
"Start to tired," protested, defending that the PQ had acted so "dishonest" and "with lack of rigour."
I noted that "the minimum" would be that the PQ it apologize.
The formula of the consortia is a common practice in the world.
Normally, it is a partnership with a temporary limit which allows two or several companies bring together their expertise to respond to a tend for a project complex.
The project Eastmain presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the work.
The projects have already begun and last until 2012.
In any case the, the contract has been granted without enter at stake the competence; it has sought a negotiation.
In addition, the formula of the consortia has ceased to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for projects relatively straightforward.
As published the week Le Devoir, the formula of the consortia in the area of technical advice is still under investigation in the Government.
A out rapid to the commercial register of Quebec allowed to identify more than 200 consortia, of which some appear permanent.
In this way, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its main competitor, CIMA as +, GENIVAR, SNC -Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and other.
A combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, is to say, Dessau.
With regard to consortium Energie gerance, the Minister Normandeau has highlighted that "the territory of the James Bay responds to a dynamic of labour particular and Hydro Quebec- responded specifically to it since the 1970s years "
The great leader of the project Eastmain, Real Laporte, of the Societe denergie of the Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that I has highlighted the fact that the contract management of the project has been granted directly.
"If answer to a tend and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"Have two options: can contact with the sector actors and say: we are going to negotiate an agreement satisfactory and with a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," noted Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to consortium Energie gerance form part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 procured by the Party Quebec.
Contracts were granted to Hydro Quebec -or the SEBJ for the project Eastmai-1 -A- Sarcelle -Rupert.
Following the check, Le Devoir has identified 109 contracts of technical advisory granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their branches, in particular laboratories geotechnical.
SNC -Lavalin has received 22 contracts, GENIVAR received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in Energie gerance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, amount to 449.783.344 United, including the contract of Energie gerance of 295.131.564 United.
Sylvain Simard has given to understand that the four enterprises that are the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known of the Liberal Party of Quebec."
The Minister Normandeau is no longer fall to the PQ is also linked to these companies, that the "financed," before starting point that it is more of their leaders.
Barometer of consumption responsible. The central "green" does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer Quebec little trust in the actors of sustainable development, as well as the holders of fair trade or in the green certificates to guide their elections.
According to the Barometer of consumption responsible, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a universe media where swarm messages to defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that even hampers their commitment.
Even if it has increased consumption of products socalled "socially responsible" in 2010, the Quebec seem to give very little credit to those who attempt sell.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that distrust in the compromise environmental enterprises and in advertising green of the same, reveals the tools of measurement elaborate on the observatory of consumption responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers cast doubt on the reliability of certificates commissions that carry products socalled fair, as well as the credibility of the products and holders to be carried labels indicating that are "eco responsible," notes the Barometer.
Similarly, only a 14,6% of the Quebec take seriously the speeches by politicians on this issue.
In any case, information on the consumption responsible seems essential to promote this sector of consumption, supported currently at about one third of consumers Quebec.
In fact, the gaps and the nature of the information are doubtful that a 46% of consumers discard this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, a third of the Quebec say distrust also of the alleged returns of the organic products or services that are pursued sell.
Moreover, almost half of the consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the mark of one or several products to respect its conviction.
A 61% has given priority to procurement in the Stores of its neighborhood and has chosen buy food products cultured in their region, notes the Barometer.
More free and responsible (the rate of consumption responsible has reached 64 points on a maximum of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec love occupy the post of King of recycling which seeks to reduce its impact on the environment worrying for the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, that social conscience seems to be (of his car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of the Quebec indicated that have used the public transport or have shared car to defend its principles green.
In addition, the 39,1% of the participants of this comprehensive survey of conduct, that has just completed its first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and displacement to start.
A loan for which the State recover Excentris
The Government of Quebec, to that have asked to commit itself financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas Excentris pos the Societe Angus and the Parallèle, accepted work, but only through a loan.
The Societe of Angus developpement and the Parallèle, them expected that a grant of seven million of the Ministry of Culture to return to buy to Daniel Langlois the complex film Excentris in the boulevard Saint -Laurent and back its real vocation cinephile, have not achieved what asked.
The Government has accepted involved in the matter, but in their own conditions.
Instead of the grant expected, the Government of Quebec has proposed a loan which would amount, in fact, less than the initial expectations; that could be a viable solution in terms advantageous, at least in view of certain employees.
Quebec had already rejected last spring a first action plan and a request of 12,8 million, but since then applications have been revised downward.
The President of the Societe of developpement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, that leads the file of Excentris, forwarded a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister St -Pierre.
It has submitted a final report makes a ten of days.
However, the SODEC received a counter of office on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have to run until December 31th to respond to the same.
In any case, seems to be disposed fully the possibility of a grant of State.
Let us remember that the Association of Trade mark divisions of cinema and complex film of Quebec I was opposed to a direct investment of State to support the recovery of Excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not fund projects Real Estate, because it has done with other divisions of cinema.
Furthermore, various representatives of the sector itself demands a considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the same, has taken over ten years the burden of cinema of author on their premises of the complex, following finance their own construction, which could justify a repeal by the Council of the Treasury.
The lack of rooms for movies independent it is evident in Montreal and Excentris had known loyalty to its customers.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, addressed by Christian Yaccarini, provided for its part a campaign of funding in private, awaiting meet 700.000 dollars to open up road to the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these chambers, the Parallèle, is projecting movies in Excentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three courtrooms the next February 27th, projecting the beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois "Des et des hommes Dieux."
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to get in touch with Le Devoir and we do not know what they think I and his group of the proposals to the low that have received.
The debate the veil of Canada complexed...
The new cables American diplomats reported by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considered as the complex of the Canadians with regard to the Americans, but reflected in the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter to Canada.
Diplomats it is surprise that the voters Canadians do not think in relations Canada -United States when going to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped to conservative government to make it approve its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday, provide more juicy details that will really substantial.
A cable of September 22th, 2008, is to say, for full federal election campaign, tells to what extent the United States does not fall into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This provoked a great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
The mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of inferiority virtually inherent to the Canadians in addressing the issues home daily, in time to make this choice to the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade in 1988) ," written.
Therefore, thus concluded, the United States are "the elephant proverbial of this election: pervasive, but potentially too dangerous to speak of it."
The ambassador is even more problems in understand this "silence deafening" because the two countries maintain a intense relations political and economic.
"Logically, believes, the capacity of a candidate, a party and, even more, of the head of a party to manage these relations essential should be a key factor in which we should think the voters at the time of vote."
We can see this feeling of importance also the cable sent on January 22th, 2009 for Terry Breese, role of business in Ottawa, to prepare for the president Barack Obama to his first visit to Ottawa.
"Its journey will help to ensure the survival of government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, through which Canada record for the first time deficit in the last decade owing to a recovery plan between 30,000 and 40 billion," writes Mr. Breese.
In any other hand mentions that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that is we substitute the coalition or that the opposition parties conditioned their survival to the quality of recovery plan proposed.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by the ambassador Wilkins alert to Washington on the image increasingly refusal to bear the series dramatic spread in the CBC of United States.
The ambassador is concerned the emission of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where there are references little subtle Maher Plow to, to the "No- Fly -List" or even to the kidnappings to the CIA take energetic interrogation.
Another cable mind that, during its first meeting bilateral, Hillary Clinton asked to its counterpart French Bernard Kouchner if Europe willing to receive some prisoners in Guantanamo.
The mr Kouchner responded that it, but that depended "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has implemented a document to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a Muslim 15 years of origin canadian."
"The Secretariat accepted reviewed the file."
Finally, we can mention that have been heated the mood in relation to the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, stated in the radio CBC that the responsibility of the mass flight should be "killed."
In United States they publicized of Mike Huckabee.
A global plan for revitalizing the lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed in Cancun a plan for renewal of the lighting domestic, commercial and industrial at one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional questions that must be carried out to stabilise the climate of the world by 2,020.
This ambitious plan this instrument too in the whole of major projects particular that the UN expected to be adopted in Cancun compensated for the absence of binding commitments reduction in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the Bulbs incandescent, that still monopolize between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, it we substitute by Bulbs fluocompact or, even better, by Bulbs of diodes electroluminescent (OF or "LED" in English), it avoid large part of the 1.800 million tonnes (Gt) of GHG issued in the world to illuminate to the human.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70 per cent of emissions of park motor vehicle planetary.
In Copenhagen, the past year, the large country producers, as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, committed themselves to a voluntary reduction plans which should reduce global emissions of GHG of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, should be reduced even 5 Gt of that amount to stabilize, by 2,020, the increase in temperatures in the two grades C to prevent amok.
In the Bulbs incandescent, 95 per cent of energy is dissipates the form of heat and the rest, is to say, 5 per cent, produces light.
In the case of the Bulbs fluocompact, the cost of energy reduces fourfold and with the new Bulbs LED, boils down to two times more energy consumption.
The Bulbs fluocompact last an average of between 6 and 10,000 hours.
The new Bulbs LED, as those that have directed the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the study of the UN), have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and use 80 per cent less power than a bulb incandescent, which allows us ask ourselves an idea of savings that can be achieved with the plan substitution which would in one hundred countries.
These new Bulbs can also work with Rheostats and by very little heat.
Above, not contain anything of mercury.
Various experts have expressed their reservations in relation to the Bulbs fluocompact, since they contain mercury and that must be eliminated as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, except that the manufacturers place instructions.
However, indicates the report, the main source of emissions of mercury in the world are not the Bulbs fluocompact, but the central thermal of coal, that by a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that it wasted with the Bulbs incandescent.
Only in the United States, these power stations by 25 000 tonnes of mercury in the year.
The report spells out the advantages that offer the international agenda for each country.
For example, Indonesia it would save this way billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, is to say, the equivalent to 3.5 central thermal whose construction is cost 2.500 million.
Côte dIvoire expected anxiously the announcement of the election results
The SecretaryGeneral of the UN, Ban Ki -moon, has requested the issuance" immediate "of the results of the presidential elections in Côte dIvoire, given that have expired the deadlines set.
"The SecretaryGeneral stresses the need for the independent election commission complete its work and advertise the interim results immediately," highlights a spokesperson of the head of the UN.
"Calls upon all parties in Côte dIvoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative so that it advertise the interim results."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has made that length the deadline of Wednesday to midnight without which it publish the results, three days from the scrutiny of Sunday.
Around 40 minutes before the end of term, the President of the CIS had commented on television that the committee "age was working" for announcing the results.
On Wednesday have multiplied in the world the demands of the CIS proclaim finally the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and its opposition Alassane Ouattara.
However, the side of Gbagbo account with the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the votes ..."" in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the Armed (new FN) since the coup detat failed September 2002.
Pascal Affi Nguessan, director of the campaign of the President of Côte dIvoire, has said that the delaying of intimidation of voters undertaken by the FN in the north of the country had discouraged to supporters of the outgoing president to go to vote.
The whole election could be void if the Constitutional Council accepted complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, the opponents of Gbagbo consider that the highest court of the country is not neutral, because it is led by Paul Yao Ndrea, a close ally political Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the North that denies any connection with the former rebels, has tried to "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of results and has asked to Gbagbo that the respect, but has not gone as far as to claim the victory.
Its allies say that Gbagbo blocks the publication of results because I knows that has been lost and to submit a complaint before the Constitutional Council after having prevented that the election commission the dissemination of results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential, Sunday, should be given the cherry the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years ago since.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday to the political class of Côte dIvoire that could be considered responsible for potential acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended up in the first round, on October 31th, with the 38 of the votes against the Alassane Ouattara (32% of, that publicly received the support of the former President Henri Konan Bedie (25 per cent in the first round).

Subject Clotilde Reiss: the Eliseo has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French research detained in Iran for "espionage," has been in suspense the public in France, has alerted to diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the care view of the diplomatic United States.
The documents it obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain aspects unknown this crisis.
Described how the Eliseo has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point to give advice to manage their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of Walkers).
Show how those responsible for French tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French not occurred in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by the US justice for traffic of material to the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency attempted manipulation to the media to give the idea that the president Syrian, Bachar As -Assad, had played a vital role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted on August 12th, 2009 in Paris for the title "Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases of hostagetaking."
The advisor of Eliseo for strategic issues, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai Dorsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with the US diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
It spelled the method French.
Advise to the Americans to do the following to repatriate to their own citizens withheld to force in Iran.
"Do noise," say, "throw off continued" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranian I called for that Pareis, do it more frequently still."
Because, eleven exhausted the attempts of negotiation on channels discrete, "silence does not solve anything," Iranians are "experts in delaying delaying."
The mr Richier adds that the detention of aliens is "a tactic Iranian usual: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
Said that the release of imprisonment of Clotilde Reiss (that there will be on August 16th, day in which it refuge in the Embassy of France) "will require the fertilizer to the Iranian a great deal of money" (230.000 EUR prize).
In addition, notes that the Eliseo anticipated other crisis of hostages, a phenomenon that "will increase."
The Iranian could "in the near future stop to another some 1.800 people French people living in Iran," states.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss emerges from prison after 12 days, but there is still blocked in Iran.
Is it disseminates the following information: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request the United States on illicit trafficking of electronic material sensitive towards Iran, has been released in Paris by decision of a judge.
The US embassy, as many observers, doubt of this strange coincidence.
In Washington, to close the networks clandestine Iranian of procurement for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
France has accepted an exchange?
Unleashed the Iranian to change the French?
For a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier ensures that it was not.
The Eliseo, states, not only "has been struck dramatically by the judg's decision " but which has attempted to oppose the same.
"Has been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot -Marie), but" the French Government cannot overturn the decision "judicial, comments.
The mr Richier also wants to prove that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" monitoring of information services French.
The advisor of Eliseo marks a number of telephone, hangs and, after, informed the US diplomatic that the Iranian "is currently in a few buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Eliseo has spared no efforts in, used reported and "leakage" organized in the media to do believe that the Syrian President Bachar As -Assad plays a role" important "and" influential "of" mediator "
Americans see this activity with a certain irony and you check that the manipulation gives its fruits, since several articles of the press bear the official version French.
A telegram to date August 25th, 2009 mentioned "the blitz media of officials French."
Why is this "gratitude" towards the mr Assad, this question the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite its statements full of praise, officials French recognise in private that only have a vague idea of what has actually done the Syrian."
Below, the document is the reasons that led to Eliseo to start on this fiction.
The great effort of communication "aimed validate the policy of Sarkozy of openness towards Syria," believes.
A policy initiated in 2008, that "in view of many critical voices in France and abroad, just be crossed of premature and undeserved."
The "overemphasize the role Syrian," Paris tries "to show Syria the praised that can harvest if plays a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also in "plant the seed of the discord between Syria and Iran."
The US embassy knows of good source.
The events of August 11th, François Richier is hoped: "of course, we do not know whether the Syrian have done something or not."
"But in any case, is what we are grateful."
"At least, this would cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss return to France on May 16th, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy the receives in the Eliseo.
In a statement, grateful to the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Sirius that have played a "active role in favour of the liberation of our compatriot."

In the middle of the storm triggered by the suspicion of corruption, the executive committee of FIFA designates the Thursday countries organisers of the Drinking of the world by 2,018 and 2,022, a choice clearly policy where fighting of influence and the lobbying can reach paramount on the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of 2,018 of the race of FIFA will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, -Spain Portugal and Netherlands- Belgica).
The edition of 2,022 will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation hoped conquer new Territories (Qatar, Australia), after a feat in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its introduction in the United States or in the Far Middle (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, the Prince William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jose Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the heads of Government Belgian and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies the economic and political interests at stake in a World.
Transactions between racks, therefore, is possible that last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the evaluation report on FIFA, candidatures English, hispano -portuguesa (2018) US and (2022) have better arguments that its competitor.
However, these considerations will not be too much weight to the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could be crushed and opportunities of their country, cradle of football, that only hosted the World eleven, in 1966.
The BBC added heated to the bonfire Monday to disseminate a documentary that has been exposed to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to disgust to FIFA and shame to the responsible English, that have been directed to an intensive lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron to the head.
The Head of Government hoped reissue the coup been successfully by his predecessor, Tony Blair, that had been achieved in 2005 in London the organization of the JJ. OO. 2012.
This intensive activity, be enough to restore the brightness of England to the CE?
It is not clear, since the duo Spain -Portugal has also with many strength thanks to their stages, now ready, its experience (World of 82 in Spain, JJ. OO in Barcelona in 1992, Cup of Europe in 2004 in Portugal) and its culture football.
However, the bleak outlook economic and financial in both countries could to remove their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts on the solvency of Spain and Portugal the only thing they achieve is to give points to Russia, converted in an outsider of weight despite the gaps in its candidature (stages, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not scroll to Zurich and has reported a "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a reference directly to the allegations of the press English against members of the EC.
"Are drawing to shine their rags dirty, trying engage them," Putin stated.
For 2,022, the United States, that have experience of 1994, the Favorites seem more logical.
First world economic power and seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country it seems take advantage to Japan and South Korea, that have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries that have organized together the Championship in 2002.
Another risk: the extension of the World 2,026 to China, fervently desired by FIFA, that cause that Asia it became without opportunities for 2,022.
Along with Qatar, that has submitted its project basis in stages futuristic, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion to new horizons, but both countries face more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be injured by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (in terms of the time difference) by the European countries, the backbone of the war to FIFA.
Second term: the test
Of Gaulle really had doubted.
Mitterrand had implied that doubted.
Valery Giscard dEstaing and Jacques Chirac did not even the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less still.
A mandate in the Eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
However, evidence that combine not well with the mystery that is associated to the presidential.
Therefore, we must always appear that is certainly.
Towards the one hand and to the other.
In 2006, although it might believe, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed not discarded a third mandate.
On 15 November, in tone serious, Nicolas Sarkozy show that would its decision "at some point in autumn 2011."
Therefore, the fact that question with Members of the UMP, on Tuesday evening in the Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
It is the official announcement of its candidature?
Far less.
The President just stated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited to two the number of mandates five years.
Simply transmitting the facts, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that speaks of the presidential, with a tone jocular, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, cases, still will pass seven and a half years with me," had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "No think that I do not myself what comes after."
Their statements to no more day before yesterday it closer to the candidature, nor less.
Raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidature in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolène Royal has uploaded to the fore what leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to confide.
Quite the contrary; the fact that its candidature in 2012 become evident that is what leads to many of the PS to call it organises the battle ahead of schedule.
Furthermore, the poor polls.
For the first time, the voters of rightwing prefer the candidature of François Fillon to the Nicolas Sarkozy (the 46% compared to 44, according BVA -LExpress).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no debate on the subject," has reacted immediately and wisely the environment of Prime Minister.
"If you believe that may lose, will not be a candidate," view Jean -Pierre Raffarin.
"Always think that can gain," corrected Alain Juppe, resigned to the evidence.
: euro the ECB is bound to maintain their procurement of Lyrics of State
The last meeting of the Council of governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should help refine modalities of exit the crisis or, at least, announcing the interruption of a large number of operations conventional not monetary policy which should end at the end of year.
Because of the crisis of sovereign debt European, the institute of emission of Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to be so peremptory if not want risk to aggravate a situation more complicated than today in the markets of obligations Europeans.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the Minister of Finance French, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of the solution of the debt crisis of the European States.
It has not wanted to say if considered that the central bank should do more, increasing for example its programme of the purchase of State obligations.
"Me to my colleagues I reserve my opinion Europe...."
The eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the chairman of the ECB, -Jean Claude Trichet, it was more eloquent in regard to their intentions, indicating only that the programme of the purchase of Lyrics of State at the secondary market" has continued "and that" we shall see what we decided "during the meeting of Thursday.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main type constant in the 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of obligations of the Treasury on the part of the ECB has doubled the week to achieve close 1.350 million.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday there would be bought again qualifications Irish and Portuguese.
In total, central banks of Eurosystem have acquired qualifications for an amount of 67 billion since May 2010.
Between the operators of the market, is not the slightest doubt that continue to be the purchase (be consulted page 29).
The economists also envisaged any significant changes of course.
Although the operations of loans to more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenals of the ECB, it still makes allocations Unlimited liquidity to conditions beneficial and with durations that vary between one week and three months.
The economists hope that today we continue this decision for some months.
"I do not imagine that will change considerably its programme."
"If not, would the risk of encourage new tensions in the short term," view Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"Seems more likely to occur out a phased introduction announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipated by your side Norbert Brams, economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to the speeches made in the market of the public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of procurement of these obligations to the market will remain stable," adds Norbert Brams.
Bearing in mind the importance of presentations of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt of the euro zone, the institute of emissions has no option but to maintain its presence in the market.
"Must be compensated for any price the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent a marked rise of the returns subscribers by States more fragile," thought yesterday an important manager of obligations.
Because, if interest rates are set by the clouds, States will have even more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi capea the temporary
After that Italy has begun the week a way disturbing, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflux of the types of obligations to 10 years.
A restoration of calm precarious.
The outflow of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional Presidents have said that heard to Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation of "indecipherable" and expected a weekend "unpredictable," statements denied subsequently by the detainee.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference in longterm rates German had reached a record figure of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of coverage against the risk of result (CRQ) had been increased to the 263 points, leading a true stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rate was higher than 400 basic points.
But its arm right, Gianni Letta, was expressed "deeply concerned" by "the turbulence in the markets" and for a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro zone, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explained Irwin Stelzer, economist in the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of the income associated with the same, what causes that the State could suffer the risk of not meet their needs for financing.
The latest forecasts of Brussels have put a pitcher of cold water for the government.
It is estimated that growth will the Italian 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget which is being discussed in the Senate is based on a number of 1,3% and 2 per cent, respectively.
In these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will the 4,3% of GDP the next year (face the 3,9% planned by the government) and the 3.5 per cent in 2012 (in place of the workforce were unemployed).
Hence the rumor that can apply new budgetary provisions in the parties, by an amount of 7 billion.
"If necessary, should be taken further austerity measures," view the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy account with the support of international institutions.
"The basis of its economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as have been saying for some time," ensured Arrigo Sadun, the administrator Italian in the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate issue, or shortterm or longterm, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011, Edito's note), the efforts of stabilization requested to Italy are lower than the required to other countries " comments Pier Carlo Padoan, economist head of the OECD.
There is the problem of political instability.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which could anticipate elections at the end of March.
In this case, it would a period not conducive to the decisionmaking in case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect upon the strengthening of mechanisms to combat the crisis
Christine Lagarde you have said yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I i believe that we have already demonstrated the Sunday, at night and on the day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to the defence of its currency and its monetary zone."
Although was on, the relaxation made yesterday in the types of obligations of the European States has led to the Governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot speak even a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor' announced that could bring down the rating of the debt of Portugal, the target more frequent at the time of the speculation.
"As in May, really lack clarity and transparency policies, which suffer significantly on the bank systems," opinion of the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Particularly because "the political rate is much slower than the rate of markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers that hide, European countries stepped up the debates to strengthen the mechanisms of exit the crisis already existing.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance who are most directly affected and, in general, with their counterparts of the G20 are on track.
And this bearing in mind also the meetings of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the agenda, the type of measures conventional not support the countries of the euro zone in the collimator of markets (be consulted above).
With regard to the European Fund Stability Financiera (FEEF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, has begun on Tuesday in Singapore a come from Asia to inform investors of Far Middle on the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of these visits is not in raise funds, certainly prepares the ground.
It is anticipated that the first emissions of qualifications of FEEF place next month.
Yesterday, an official representative US has entrusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase of funds mobilized through a commitment additional direct IMF.
With regard to the countries that are in the first line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organization of labour market.
These reforms are addition to the austerity measures with a fact more near.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a path different to the following Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs request international assistance before applying their own Corrections budget and to structural reforms to consider indispensable to increase the confidence of a lasting.
The partners capitalist of the European funds, finally, are the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the markets of obligations public.
To step in Paris, on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to send the idea that, if the $750 million mobilized for Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the European Union does not hesitate to return to draw the portfolio.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a player in the first line in the market of the European public debt, consider that an amount of approximately 100 million additional would be sufficient, "preferably" the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is a tool for this: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, furnished with at present with 600,000 million.
A council that, without doubt, could consider detail European capitals.
Especially if reputation market conditions.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in Orange alert
The snow are leading difficulties of movement, especially in the network including in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twentyfour departments are alert Orange due to the risk of snow and training of ice.
Eure, Eure -et- Loir, Deux -Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments that were already in warning Orange, eighteen from Wednesday to the day and two, Dordogne and Gironde, it joined the group on the night.
According Meteo France, the strong snow falls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, but also snow slightly in island of France.
We expect some segments of snow of between 2 and 5 cm, promptly of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even 5 cm, in the region Paris.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente -Maritime, Côtes dArmor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Baja Normandy, island of France and Limousin.
The snow are sufficiently strong as to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, alert Meteo France.
In the Côtes dArmor, has been prohibited access to several departmental road vehicles metals over 7,5 tonnes, including the themes Guingamp -Lannion and Saint- Brieuc -Loudeac.
According to the gendarmes, the movement in the network including Britain is complicated, therefore recommended that it is not conducive except in case of need and it has prohibited the movement of certain vehicles TER during the day.
During the Thursday, has been banned the school transport in Craftiness.
It had provided no specific measures on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of vehicles metals.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to lead with the greatest restraint on the roads and to adapt its conduct to the situation."
The Directorate General of the civil aviation (DGAC) requested to airlines that annulling on Thursday 25 per cent of their flights in the Parisian of Roissy airport and 10 per cent in Orly because of the snow scheduled.
The DGAC recommends to air passengers that they are in contact with their airline.
In Great Britain, the airport Gatwick, the south of London, and the Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris metro: first financial draft
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the Island of France has reached the point peak, rain thousands of millions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, speak of the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris which must build the Societe du Grand Paris.
To begin the SGP, the State has announced an allocation of funds 4 billion.
In the theory, this amount will be that will allow subsequently to the SGP obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its dual loop.
Today, finally, we have the first day.
The law of finance amendment of 2010, discussed in the commission of finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the mechanisms envisaged to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the establishment of a special tax of equipment and the increase of tax offices in the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "benefit of the public institution Societe du Grand Paris."
In addition, is fixed in numbers: "The result of this tax is 117 million per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize, increase their output and allocating a said increase in the Societe du Grand Paris."
How it would with this method?
Who knows.
In the text does not provide figures.
But it is far from 4 billion.
"Is required that the fiscal resources are add to the 4 billion of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that it shall grant the Societe du Grand Paris as progress the draft," can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is no surprise that system.
"From the moment when creating income (the two taxes, Edito's note), we can cover studies for three years and after receiving the 4 billion later, according explain. "
"It record in the budget and be used in the role of the needs."
The SGP estimated that empecera to receive the 4 billion in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This decision, in which the 4 billion pledged are not in the credit, may cause a parliamentary debate slightly on.
The first public meeting will be on December 7th.
Avengers hackers and spies diligent
The issue WikiLeaks has a dual value.
On the one hand, reveals a scandal apparent, a scandal that only appear scandal before the hypocrisy governing relations among States, citizens and the press.
Furthermore, announced profound changes to the international level and provides for a future dominated by the regression.
But we are step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each system established by a secret service (irrespective of the nation to the containing) is formed exclusively by press clippings.
The "extraordinary" revelations Americans on customs sex of Berlusconi only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those who belong to) Berlusconi and the profile ominously mocking of Khadafi takes a long time given to the ideas of cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule according to which secret files only must be educated on news for public knowledge is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If visit a library dedicated to publications esoteric, see that each project repeated (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes -is- Château, the Templar or the Rosicrucian) exactly what had been written in the previous work.
This is not due solely to the authors of texts occult not want to make investigations unpublished (or not know where to seek developments on the nonexistent), but because those who are at occultism not only trust in what we already know, what reconfirms what had already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the dossiers secret.
The informer is lazy, as is lazy (or has little longing) the head of the secret services (if it could not be, I know what, Editor of Liberation), only considered true that we can recognise.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that sent the US embassy of Rome the Department of State was the same as published the Newsweek the previous week.
Then, why have caused such stir the revelations of these dossiers?
On the one hand, only say that every person cultivated already know, is to say, that the embassies, at least since the Second World War and since the Heads of States are called by telephone or catch the plane to meet to dinner, have lost their role diplomatic and, to exception of some exercises limited representation, have been transformed in centres of espionage.
Any spectator look at movies of research knows perfectly, only pretend that we do not know by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact of publicly to repeat it breaks the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker anyone can consult the more secret secret of the most powerful country of the world affects considerably to the prestige of the Department of State.
Therefore, the scandal both victims and to the "executioners."
But enter in the true nature of what has happened.
Formerly, in the was of Brother, could be seen to be able as a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of their subjects.
The prophecy of Brother has become reality since, may monitor each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction carried out, hotel visited, Highway taken, the citizen is became thus in a comprehensive victim of eye of power.
But when it shows, as is happening now, that even the crypts of the secret of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power to control every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can learn all the intelligence of power.
How can endure a power that can no longer or retain their own secret?
It is true, as already stated Georg Simmel, that a genuine secret is a secret vacuum (and a secret vacuum there can never be sleepless); is also true that all knowledge on the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact a secret vacuum, no secret, since that time the public area; but reveal, as has been WikiLeaks, that the secret of Hillary Clinton were secret gaps means delay any power.
Wikileaks it is not made any damage to Sarkozy or Merkel, but, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this scar caused to a power so powerful?
It is evident that, in the future, States no longer be put in the network no information reserved, since it would be as publish in a Poster in full street.
But it is also clear that, with the current technologies, we cannot wait to keep confidential talks by telephone.
Nothing is easier to uncovering if and when a Head of State has shifted in plane and has been in contact with one of the counterparts.
How will be able to maintain in the future relations private and confidential?
I understand perfectly that, at the moment, my purview is one of science fiction and, therefore, novel, but I imagine a governmental actors that are moving to a discrete in proceedings with routes uncontrollable, carrying messages that have been learned of memory or, as much, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
This information is preserving then, in a single copy, in drawers closed with key: to end all, the attempt to espionage of Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
In the past, i have written to the technologies currently progressing as a crab, is to say, back.
A century after the telegraph without cables has revolutionalized communication, Internet has returned to create a telegraph with cables (entry).
The videotapes (analog) had enabled to researchers of cinema consider a film step by step, progress and back, discovering all the intelligence of assembly, while now the CD (digital) only allow progress or take in chapter in chapter, is to say, to proportions enormous.
With TGV trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while plane, with displacement which entails, we need three hours and average.
Therefore, is nothing beyond the normal that the policy and techniques of communication take us back to the cars of horses.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press trying understand what is plotting in secret in the embassies.
At present, are the embassies those that are confidential information to the press.
Climate: the handyman of France on their promises of funding
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether we have respected the promises of funding rapidly unlocked (call fast start or early) undertaken by developed countries.
And we have sleepless the handyman French.
In the agreement in Copenhagen, developed countries committed themselves to provide $30 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union pledged to provide 7.200 million over three years and France 1.260 million (is to say, 420 million a year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to the financing fast start it is true: a report detailing the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a great event complementary, the distribution of brochures...
The operation transparency result appreciable and was appreciated for what really worth: developing countries and civil society would like that all developed countries hiciesen the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU said that has been liberated 2010 $2.2 million, which the places in the right track towards the fulfilment of its commitment to 7.200 million in 2012.
But, if study the situation detail, things are more complicated.
According to the agreement in Copenhagen, the money must be "new and additional" to ensure that we take a complementary effort, without encroaching on the official development assistance.
Unfortunately, it has not reached agreement on what that means "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
At present, each choose the reference that more is it.
For example, the Commission has taken as reference the year 2009: it maintains the international finance and add 150 million over three years in concept of financing fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in regard to the year or at the level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all the projects new" of the year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, no reference to the cost of the previous years and the level of the total official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing), while intended to be respected their commitment in terms of funds "new and additional..."
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Eleven again, there is no rule and each choose the method of calculation.
Some, as France, consider that each euro by means of a euro donated.
Obviously, such thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (frequently, projects relating to the reduction of emissions that are based on technologies more effective), is fallacious to submit a euro that is going to regain as equivalent to a euro that donates... As much, only should be compute to their commitments the cost of loan for the country which gives the loan (is to say, the equivalent to a kind of interest).
But France it is useful that reasoning: "respected" its commitment to 420 million making a 91,5% of loans (389,8 million) and a 8,5% of donations (36,1 million); be consulted the document of the EU to view for their own eyes.
This is the only country in the European Union that uses so often the loan.
Germany is used in a 46%, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among other, respect their commitments with a 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides a euro to fulfil its commitment, France alone accounted for 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its funding fast start, France made a double abuse: on the one hand, in connection with actions at the time and, by another, in connection with the real financial effort.
Spending only 36,1 million, failed to give the impression that spent 420 million "new and additional," as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that is Bercy who has been seized of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why was the other Member States to continue donating when they can simply provide?) as in the negotiations, since developing countries are not silly...
The chapter of the funding situation is a trifle, relatively short term, in relation to the whole of the negotiations on climate.
But it could be a grain of Sandy more in the vast machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that that is not the case.
Is it any, it is essential to learn from this first year of financing early.
Firstly, France could announcing a change in its method of calculation for the year 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting their commitments and the same way that the remaining countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could do that advance the debates on the stakes involved in relation to the longterm funding (another chapter essential that we are discussing today): we do not rid of the issue of "additional" and the method for compute loans.
France could change its position to give as progressive in connection with this issue as it is with other.
Therefore, we have the hope of the new Minister of Environment, the madam Kosciusko -Morizet, that will arrive at Cancun next week.
An announcement surprise on the fast start of France and on his vision of "additional" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence necessary for progress in negotiations.
Advice on pesticides ingested for children
A child in 10 years ingested in a day 81 chemical substances different, as indicated a study published on Wednesday the partnership Generations Futures (the old movement for the rights and the respect of future generations).
The partnership, which cautions that its results "not have a value Statistical significant bearing in mind the limited number of samples considered, but are illustrative of the problems addressed," purchased in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September the food that is consume a child of approximately ten years in four meals and a snack the day.
These meals taken as a model, that respect the official recommendations (five parts of fruit and vegetables fresh, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day), as well as the candies, were discussed in the laboratories seekers of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The outcome of the point is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as cancer possible or likely and five substances classified as cancer insurance, as well as 37 substances open to act as disturbing endocrine (EP), according to studies of various institutions such as the centre of international research on cancer.
"Although, in almost all cases, is not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our study shows clearly that the presentation of consumers to pollutants possibly cancer and/or EP is worrying," notes the partnership.
For the breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk contain alone more than a ten of waste cancer possible and three considered as cancer insurance, as well as close to a score of waste that is encroaching on the hormonal system.
The apple, Imported of Brazil, planned as snack to the school, contains traces of six chemical substances, included a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the Jewish Green of Kenya, contained in the food, in which the study has been detected traces a powerful insecticide prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the steak Russian, the tuna in tin and even the bar of bread or the gum were seasoned with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of tap, the analysis found the presence of Nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the slice of salmon was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical waste detected and even the analysis of the point of plastic used for heat food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails of pollutants" for the consumer "probably be underestimates," said the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecologia -Les Verts (EE- LV), for its part, has proposed "addressed to the gravity of the situation" impose a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase of diseases associated with civilization."
In July, a study of the European Agency for Food Security (EFSA) show the presence of waste for 365 pesticides different identified in the fruit and vegetable consumed in Europe, of whom 76 on cereals.
