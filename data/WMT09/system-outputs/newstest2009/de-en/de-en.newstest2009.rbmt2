The Prague stock exchange throws into the minus against closing time. 
After the steep drop in the morning the Prague stock exchange could correct the losses. 
EZ reached almost the half of the normal daily routine the transactions with the shares of?. 
The Prague stock exchange tied at the beginning of the Tuesday trade to the burglary of the Monday at once when it sank by another six percentage points. 
The reason for the burglary lay on Wall Street this time. 
The reaction of the market to the result of the coordination of the American House of Representatives which had declined to support a stabilization plan for the finance sector there lets itself be seen also in Czechia so. 
Case of the shares in Asia 
The shares experienced a dramatic case at the stock exchanges in Asia on Tuesday although the indices in the course of the day could make good a part of the losses. 
The index scorch the slope stock exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points in the course of the business day, could make up for a part of the losses, however, later, therefore the fall was reduced to about 2.5 per cent. 
The index slope scorch China Enterprises which notices the movement of the Chinese shares in the stock exchange in Hong Kong sank by 3.8 per cent, the markets were closed in Shanghai. 
The shares at the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five per cent, then reduced the losses, however, to 4.3 per cent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan sank by 3.6 per cent after the index there. 
"The timing for the rescue operation is unsafe in the USA and will influence the finance markets worldwide", so the boss of the currency authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong determines its monetary policy alone, so independently of the Chinese central bank although it belongs to China. 
The interest rates in Hong Kong are on the same standard as this one in the United States. 
The American legislators should return as fast as possible to the negotiating table and say goodbye to the outline for a support of the financial system according to words of the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. 
Otherwise threaten that also further countries would be affected by the burglary. 
A bloodbath of American shares 
The American House of Representatives has the plan for a support of the financial system refused, for this up to 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillions K)?you should use on Monday. 
The legislators ignored the request of president George Bush so to support the plan. 
In Bushs opinion the plan would regulate the basic reasons for the financial crisis and therefore help to stabilize the entire economy. 
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday and the most important stock indexes recorded the greatest burglary in more than 20 years. 
The Dow Jones index sank by almost seven per cent, it had recorded a similar burglary last in 1987. 
The index was the index already experienced a liberal case but there hardly were symptoms that the outline wouldn't come through in the parliament, sunk before the coordination. 
Convention makes concession: U.S. government may pump out 700 billion dollars to the banks 
The topmost representatives of the American convention and the government of president George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on a financial aid for the American financial system. 
You shall coordinate about this at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in conversations about the adoption of a rescue plan in form of a financial aid for the American financial system on a scale of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillions crowns.) 
This doesn't mean any victory yet, though. 
The convention representatives still must negotiate some details of the agreement namely before they publish the final setting of the law and may vote on it. 
The financial system is negotiated the plan to the support in the American convention on Monday. 
On Sunday the chairman of the committee for banks and financial services Barney Frank told this to the agency of Reuter. 
The plan probably could be voted on at the earliest on Wednesday according to different details in the senate. 
A notification should be the first important psychological factor according to economists about this for a revival of the finance markets that the plan is approved. 
After that it comes, however, to a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms how one could help the markets also in the practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
"We have obtained an important progress. 
We have Bloomberg told Nancy Pelosi the democrat opposite the agency cleared our different opinions to this how a package shall look for the stabilization of the market ". 
According to your words it still could come to a final vote on Sunday. 
Representatives of the legislators met the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson in the night to Sunday to award its definite form to the government fund. 
This provides an Abkauf of unsalable mortgage assets of the finance companies which throw the finance companies into serious losses and endanger the stability of the complete system. 
"We are at the edge of a definite agreement about a plan which will work and which must be also effective on the market. 
One must so Paulson continue the recovery plan still further but I think we are at the aim ". 
A signal for Asiengeschäfte 
The global financial crisis finds its expression also considerably in the stock markets which strongly sink. 
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators try still to reach a definite agreement in the convention in front of Sunday. 
Before business, one wants to calm the investors namely with that on the Asian finance markets which are located in the first time zone where a decision of the convention could influence the business on Monday. 
Till now is still when will coordinate both chambers of the American congress on the law not quite clearly, also rules over it uncertainty whether the negotiations couldn't really fail because of a problem in last minute yet, however. 
The legislators hope that it is adopted within the next days. 
However, the law still will learn some changes. 
The total amount intended for the help for the system shall be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars shall be provided as fast as possible as president demanded George Bush. 
However, the convention can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program doesn't fulfill its function and to be more precise at further 100 billion dollars and 350 billion dollar later the definite. 
Bush judges progress to be positive in negotiations 
The president has a power of veto at this decision, the convention can outvote its veto, though. 
Despite these changes has, however, the basic idea of the program which was based on it lasted, finances, for the Abkauf of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen to attain because hundreds of thousands Americans are not able to repay their mortgages any more. 
"We have worked everything out. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, the senate then on Monday, ", so the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
The American president Bush also appeared satisfied with the progress. 
His speaker Tony Fratto declared, Bush is satisfied with the progress of the Saturday and " troubling on both sides estimates, stabilize our finance markets and protect our economy ". 
Restriction of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the bank trash of the senate Christopher Dodd, the leading negotiator, said, this one legislators would have agreed on a responsibility for the financial program, the protection of the taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of privileges and a time schedule for the financing of the plan. 
The new law also shall reduce the so-calledly golden parachutes for directors of the societies, which is involved in the program and establishes a committee which the supervision shall be incumbent about the fund. 
The Treasury shall conduct this. 
"We have worked very hard and reached a great progress in the direction of an agreement which works and is important to the market and to all Americans", so Paulson. 
The plan also expects a help for home owners who have problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates at mortgages which it buys up in which the aim consists in and in lowering the monthly costs for the debtors in making it possible for them to keep their houses. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The suggested plan is a good idea after the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek but the putting into action gets very difficult. 
"And although because one doesn't know by which mechanism and around which price the problematic assets are bought up therefore. 
This will Marek said to the server iHNed.cz this week be decisive for it how the finance sector and the government divide the losses up between each other ". 
Whether the plan or you adopt at the beginning of next week, isn't decisive to Mareks opinion now. 
"It is much more important that the convention representatives reach an agreement to support the plan and that they approve it as fast as possible. 
The psychological meaning of the agreement that it comes to a farewell is the most important ", at this moment Marek emphasized. 
Duel on Messers blade: MP3 player against mobile telephones. 
We advise you in your choice 
While almost every mobile telephone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a telephone call yet. 
It therefore looks so of course that it is better to buy only a telephone for itself. 
Despite everything there are sufficient reasons for it why one should get himself an independent player. 
The choice completely depends the future owner on the way of the use and the claims off. 
One for certain buys a terrific expensive record player for himself hardly for at home to listen on this to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once, such musical novelties don't appear on LPs and there isn't any objective reason for it from the qualitative view either. 
If you have, however, LPs with kind of skirt, jazz or blues in the shelf, you probably dream at least of a such. 
So this is expressed in simplified terms also with the music on journeys that is with compressed music, music in the MP3 format. 
There are price and quality categories also. 
Perhaps for the one it isn't acceptable to spend crowns on a player eight thousand, a pink Floyd fan will hardly well as well cope with headphones for twenty crowns of the market, however. 
Two extremes between which gives for every sufficient room. 
The choice is diversified broadly. 
The life time of the batteries is also decisive. 
Much more than only music can play Music player but they don't even create by way of a hint what mobile telephones can do some good. 
No modern device has to be used as universally as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, making a telephone call and sending an SMS a worse camera it can represent music and videos, both takes, it has a better and can navigate perhaps also. 
And, if one still includes the smart phon and communicators, one has almost a little computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can grill and no television set take a photograph. 
But the universality of the mobile telephones also brings about disadvantages. 
Be of use for the more functions on your mobile telephone, the more frequently will you have to reload it, however. 
And is playing music one of the greatest energy eaters. 
Only few mobile telephones can play music longer than zehn-zwölf hours, it is much fewer mostly. 
In this regard Music player is (special the simple) considerably efficient. 
Therefore you should expect at the cheap mobile telephones with that that they cannot play longer than a couple of hours music. 
If, from time to time, you then still make a telephone call, you prefer to buy another battery charger at safety reasons for yourself for the office -- this also applies to a more expensive equipment. 
Wanting to not you have this problem at MP3-Playern, the less good ones also bear uninterrupted business with a loading time for at least 9 hours. 
There is another problem when one wants to cover the music up on the mobile telephone. 
Unfortunately, only a low part of the equipment has a USB degree, in addition, everybody doesn't have for himself attached mobile telephone to a PC without special software directly. 
Of course one can cover the music up directly on a storage medium, becomes only few card film readers without diminution ready with the tiny memory cards which are used into mobile telephones. 
You don't need special software at Playern except for exceptions (iPod). 
You need to feed the device only over USB port with music from your PC. 
Most mobile telephones and player lay out a music library, organized according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the genre or for example the assessment by users themselves. 
Some equipment shows only the tree structure of the address list both iriver (Samsung Sony Cowon intelligent telephones with operating system), similarly like the Windows Explorer, some be able to. 
Are player more easily to use, mobile telephones can do more 
You should particularly ask the choice of a concrete device about the life time of the accumulator, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of the sound and of course also the using comfort. 
Music is primarily scenery for you and you listen to it every day in the streetcar only briefly, for example, an arbitrary mobile telephone which plays MP3 files then suffices. 
What almost every mobile telephone can really already do. 
You don't have to check also particularly, which music formats a mobile telephone or a player can process. 
Everyone creates MP3 and most music which you get will just be in this format. 
The format is part of the most common and in addition, most equipment also can play music in the WMA format. 
AAC (a format which Apple and its iPods use) is less usual. 
Better mobile telephones also make the purchase of music online possible. 
One only needs to call the appropriate sides of a provider (or another supplier) over a mobile Internet and one already can purchase a song or album. 
This service can already actually be an apt argument for it why one should get himself a music mobile telephone. 
Unfortunately, the supply of the providers is badly and limitedly only on fast radio hits mostly. 
The prices aren't the lowest ones either. 
One generally assumes, that (however, exactly this manner of the sale of music be about GSM, Internet wireless) it the music industry will master in future. 
Most carry the mobile telephone at themselves. 
If you feel like sounding a little, you reach in the coat pocket for the mobile telephone while the player forgotten is lying at home. 
It depends, however, on whether you always carry headphone or at least a wireless free phone facility at themselves, too. 
You can go back to the integrated loudspeaker which almost every mobile telephone has if not but MP3 player only the few. 
The probably biggest advantage of the music mobile telephones will lie in the price for many. 
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a quite decent walkman. 
The greatest handicap will be for most that no normal headphones are there. 
The best and technically most mature telephones with a 3.5 mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns. 
In turn the player is the light operation the advantage. 
(See) choice the simple and not absolutely cheap -- each player really can use. 
One, with the operation with a the in the past normal cassette recorder or for example the record player minimum is obvious to functions, the similarity. 
No collision threatens in form of a mistakenly hired mobile Internet and a then horrendous invoice for data transmissions. 
One should reach for which device now 
The cheapest mobile telephones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type m2, microSD and ä), as a rule. 
Even if you buy a corresponding card later, two thousand crowns suffice. 
But respect. 
As a rule, only cards are supported with a maximum capacity of 2 GB at the base models. 
Only the most expensive ones also can read 8 GB memory cards. 
If you want to have a mobile telephone already and buy another cheap MP3 player for themselves, then you reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver. 
You then don't have to put crowns on the table depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) any more than 1100. 
If you belong to the more demanding listeners, you take mobile telephones, walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung), specialized prefer. 
This equipment has independent using buttons for MP3 and the using comfort approaches that one of a single MP3 player so. 
MP3 player is the furthest here Sony Ericsson, his mobile telephones have the same user interface as these sold one by one from the series walkman. 
Accumulator life time (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) reaches for the same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and one do you MP3 player of the manufacturers mentioned above. 
The first virtual supplier comes to Czechia already this year. 
Perhaps 
The cellular market in Czechia is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer all services practically, like them are offered for partners also of hers in Western Europe. 
Something is nevertheless missing here, a virtual supplier who forces the classic ones to lower prices. 
Perhaps this will let wait for himself no longer. 
The Czech mobile telephone suppliers work to the most expensive ones in Europe at all, we already have about it often reported on Mobil.cz that. 
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority by the way TÚ which drew one's attention that the price for a SMS is higher than in the rest of the European Union here?. 
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of the roaming charges it so probably comes to a paradoxical situation -- for some customers of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers, from abroad, SMS will be cheaper than at home. 
How does it come that the prices are so high in the comparison with Europe in Czechia? 
The answer is simple, the competition which a declaration of war makes actual is absent. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, there are three mobile phone networks and a Penetration of far more than 100% in Czechia anyway. 
On the other hand, the mobile telephone suppliers like to complain about it, that there is much competition on the Czech market. 
The chairman of the advice of the Czech telecommunications authority often agrees (?)?, at, TÚ with it Pavel Dvo ák, too, which had that there is no place for another supplier in Czechia often said in the past. 
It makes probable that a classic supplier has no longer particularly many chances with a net of his own (he probably would by the way also hardly find frequencies.) 
However, there still is a possibility, a virtual supplier. 
Definitely the admission of virtual suppliers on the cellular market brought about a clear price reduction with himself to which the classic mobile telephone suppliers then had to react, too. 
There still were similar voices like in Czechia on the market in Great Britain with the admission of such companies like Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile. 
However, it have turned out that there is place for such suppliers and that this can be really successful. 
One by the way doesn't need for a long time to look for examples. 
We have reported over the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland in February this. 
In only half a year this supplier managed to win more than 100 one thousand customers and to climb to the five largest supplier of the country so. 
Behind Mobilking the finance group of Penta stands, among other things this one U: phons has in Czechia. 
The advantage of virtual suppliers consists that one can concentrate on a much more concrete target group. 
To be able to work effectively, virtual suppliers need namely much less customers as a classic supplier. 
You don't need relatively high costs for the making, the operation and the conversation of a mobile net namely. 
The virtual suppliers usually make a name for themselves as Low-Cost companies in the world out so, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service offering, though. 
So Tesco mobile offers SMS as its competitors at least around the half more cheaply in Great Britain, for example. 
As the example of Mobilking points, however, in Poland, it also can be a quite good gambit not to put a stereotyped target group on one. 
This supplier consults namely specifically men. 
Real guys choose Mobilking the supplier whom so David Seibert, the CEO of the mobile Entertainment company, the operator company of this virtual supplier, they like and whom they can trust " -- ". 
Hard to say whether foot could take hold of a similar concept like in Poland also in Czechia. 
The press agent of Vodafone Miroslav also doubts it?epick ý: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment most virtual suppliers are based on. 
In addition, he is relatively made replete from the view of the service offering." 
The mobile telephone suppliers mean in Czechia bound to lose 
However, it is almost sure that will be this not Mobilking, if a virtual mobile telephone supplier conquers Czechia. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project but the negotiations don't look hopeful particularly in Czechia. 
It will rather come to a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", ková, press agent of the finance group of Penta, says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studni so?. 
She indirectly confirmed so that the present mobile telephone suppliers are inclined in Czechia towards this thought not particularly. 
On the contrary, they try to do everything for this that no potential competitor arises. 
Your interest in a start of a virtual mobile telephone supplier shows the group of GTS Novera already for quite a long time which would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the area of company customers. 
"We have a great interest not to offer our customers only fixed network, but also mobile telephone telecommunications services. 
And the earlier, the better. 
We have negotiated about this possibility repeated with all Czech mobile telephone suppliers. 
We could already reach negotiation progress ", so the press agent of the group of Pavel Kaidl with some of them. 
Perhaps better times are coming now. 
Information not goes out that the first virtual supplier has to be expected perhaps by the end of the year from official. 
This is surrounded by an invincible wall of the silence till now, however. 
"At this moment, we don't assume, that place consists for a full virtual supplier in Czechia. 
The Czech market shows great Spezifika compared with other markets. 
E has appealed no subject to us ", in his explanation for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sr thinks?with a complex and serious project in this area till now yet? from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
Also further suppliers point to the Spezifik of the Czech market. 
The press agent of T mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the explanation of O2: "We haven't found any viable and on both sides advantageous project till now on which one could further build." 
And she adds: "Hardly a virtual supplier will appear in the net of T mobile by the end of the year. 
At this moment we already should a concrete offer be available have to be able to think so quickly." 
Vodafone rather turns its attention towards the fulfillment of the requirements of the 3 of one's own g license. 
Epick ý thinks Miroslav about it?: "We are straight negotiations with potential virtual suppliers particularly in the area of dividing costs and infrastructure. 
We regard exactly this as the best one from the view of the customers. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the search for a partner to the construction of a split net for a fast mobile Internet." 
The responsible authorities with the suppliers Hand in hand 
The procedure of the mobile telephone suppliers is easy to understand, another supplier would be called more competition, this also would lead this to a fall in the profits at dropping prices and through. 
So why should one make the market entry easier for such a competitor? 
The long proves also to that the suppliers can draw at a rope if it is about something and Her around the emergence of U: phon. 
TÚ went out in the direction of?, as at the moment the probably heaviest pressure U: phon came onto the market from the society T mobile. 
The publicly accessible information also covers this TÚ web pages of the?. 
U: phon as an argument why one shouldn't allow a virtual supplier is just suitable now, however. 
Martina Kemrová noticed to this: "The competition environment of the cellular market was recently still strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile telephone supplier, in addition. 
Under consideration of the character of the cellular market in the Czech Republic a new protagonist is obvious that his would on the market make services high demands alone and primarily." 
In view of this Herangehensweise of the mobile telephone suppliers the absolute lack of interest of the Czech regulation authorities astonishes, though. 
It this one isn't only it the attitude?TÚ which unfortunately doesn't have the competence in Czech as opposed to Great Britain and further highly developed states to intrude on the economic competition. 
This exclusively has the office to the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, this bought his quite typical attitude at these complete difficulties. 
"The market entry of a virtual mobile telephone supplier then would be possible after it has come to a completion of a contract between a mobile telephone supplier and a virtual supplier about the rental of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such contract was concluded till now because the supply of potential interested parties probably wasn't interesting sufficiently for the classic suppliers ", about in his answer to our enquiry Kristián Chalupa of the department outer relations of the ÚOHS. 
Of representatives of the suppliers such a wording wouldn't surprise. 
Of an authority which shall represent the consumer interests and among other things pay attention to it that nobody abuses his position on the market this is more than dubious. 
Particularly if Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad where virtual suppliers work quite normally it has to be observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction at mobile telephone services." 
The pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction probably are not part of the interests of the ÚOHS, however. 
The harmony of the three mobile telephone suppliers almost already stirring which arises from their reactions really is shocking at this case. 
The question whether it really only is chance is obvious. 
The absolutely identical price of gasoline for certain is just like only chance and the result of a hard competition for the gas stations. 
"The authority has discovered no symptoms in this thing which indicate a behavior aimed at the competition and it therefore doesn't have any reason to intervene in the matter in any way either. 
None of the suppliers has a dominant position in the market, he therefore doesn't have the corresponding increased responsibility for his behavior on the market either. 
The regulation authority probably also lacks the necessary instruments for an opening of the cellular market for virtual suppliers for telecommunications ", Chalupa led in its explanation. 
One is the interpretation of the dominating position on the market from many controversial points. 
Of course there is an analysis of the relevant markets TÚ, worked out of the?, one single market is after the telecommunications from the view of the economic competition. 
None of the Czech mobile telephone suppliers then holds a dominating position on such a market of course. 
Some on the right experts offer another position, however -- the consent of the network operator is always necessary for the market entry of a virtual supplier. 
And the mobile telephone supplier has the monopoly for his net logically. 
This one means that he takes a dominating position necessarily in a certain segment. 
Even if one, however, doesn't go along with this argumentation, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile telephone suppliers proceed conspicuously similarly. 
Troubles of a number of interested parties prove (including the mentioned society GTS Novera) that they push during negotiations with all suppliers on very similar obstacles. 
TÚ is then a quite usual trick with which the ÚOHS of the whole matter dissociates itself the Abwälzung of the responsibility on this one in the telecommunications services?. 
This had already to be watched in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, it isn't excellently, into the amendment of the telecommunications law recently adopted the?the expansion of the competences to succeed on the area of the economic competition in the telecommunications with TÚ although a number of experts had itself promised an improvement in the situation of this. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this only too well but probably they have other interests. 
It already works if nobody looks 
Unnoticed remains once the functioning of any pseudovirtueller suppliers of whom there is several in the Czech mobile phone networks at once. 
It is companies which spend price lists of their own on mobile telecommunications services which, however, only partly are public. 
It usually is namely companies which proceed in the area of multi-level marketing. 
Mobile telephone services of one's own offer Starlife and others to Amway, Bohemia Telecom, for example. 
The price lists of these companies usually reach only to chosen. 
The joke of the thing consists that the company appears as a classic corporate customer opposite the operator who orders one large amount of SIM cards. 
As an important customer he then receives special quotations (and other offers). 
The problem consists in the fact that the business conditions of all Czech mobile telephone suppliers forbid a resale taken similarly. 
"There should be cases, which you describe, then it can be an injury of the contractual conditions, which deal we then will, what can lead to a completion of the cooperation with the appropriate society", answered Martina Kemrová on our question on this problem. 
It is quite improbable that something like that doesn't get round with the persons responsible of the mobile telephone suppliers, though. 
Particularly in the fall of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands customers. 
No operator opposes, however, such a procedure. 
Profits to be not neglected namely go from the activity of these companies to them, they aren't impaired by the real official marketing as opposed to the actual virtual suppliers simultaneously. 
Miroslav draws one's attention to possible problems?epick ý attentive: "The law makes such kinds of speculation possible, despite everything the services of these companies are only used by a very little percentage of the customers. 
Furthermore these must accept that the SIM card doesn't run in telephone of their on name of their, so they cannot have it fully like the normal customers of the mobile telephone suppliers." 
Spare this alone but this one must?at least seem strange to TÚ. 
In addition, further question opens up for the ÚOHS. 
Do the mobile telephone suppliers lock the eyes before such a procedure, why do they balk at a virtual supplier? 
Himself it is added that the ÚOHS for the uncovering of such activities has quite strong competences and it must, if it doesn't want, the supplier, it wouldn't know nothing with the explanation and these would its business conditions forbid, be content. 
When Czechia isn't the most expensive any more 
How was emphasized already repeatedly in the text, did the market entry of virtual suppliers bring a clear price recession about at the different services? 
The classic suppliers have practically tried in all countries where virtual suppliers have arisen to prevent the emergence practically more or less. 
The arguments used by them were practically identically -- a too more smally or too very more saturatedly market, problems at the quality of the services etc.. 
However, the regulation organs which tried to keep the interests of the mobile suppliers but those of their customers not at all stepped in in the highly developed countries just at these moments. 
Be by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator arose and further followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulation organs throw the whole case to themselves like a hot potato. 
Starting out from our experiences we cannot rid ourselves of the impression that uncertainty is more than favorable in these cases in the competences. 
But we don't throw the shotgun into the grain. 
Perhaps soon, if the background information is correct and a virtual supplier appears soon, the Czech cellular market will get again into movement. 
If a supplier allows the origin of a virtual mobile telephone supplier, the ÚOHS won't remain idle if it is all about decline further interested parties (discriminate against). 
And then the Czeches will not make a telephone call finally any more expensively than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech hymn has four new versions. 
You choose the best one 
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday prime minister Mirek Topolánek introduced the new photos of the national anthem where on the occasion of the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony my native country is. 
The hymn got?new í B?lohlávek played in of the orchestra of the national theater under Ji's management. 
Four versions are available with masculine or female solo in choir setting and in an instrumental version. 
Ina Kn ?? ínková and Adam Plachetka took the song setting for Kate?. 
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiá? ? and Jaroslav Kr ek. 
You can listen to all four versions on the server iHNed.cz at once. 
The Czech national song is for B?one of the most beautiful hymns lohlávek. 
He had told the Czech broadcast already earlier he has selected for the solo versions singer with young, representative voices which are prominent and popular. 
"From the beginning I have at both and then tried also with the choir to adhere to a clear diction so that one understands the text well so that a harmony arises", so the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year. 
1834 resounded for the first time on the stage of the Ständetheaters in the originally Czech piece Fidlova??, the song Kde domov m J Ka of Josef Kajetán Tyl the music was from Franti?ek?kroup. 
It got popular and the people accepted it spontaneously. 
The first verse of the song then became an organic component of the national anthem after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918. 
It remained one of the seven state symbols also after the rise of the independent Czech Republic. 
How sounds the "new" hymn

In these places a switch suits the travelers also with trained staff ", which advises interested parties at the purchase of Internet and also the coupon on the card gives himself airs ", so the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrn ý. 
Next to the libraries one can be able to the electronic coupons give themselves airs also to self-service machines on the Open card, into some subway vestibule these are appropriate. 
What do such machines look like? 
You are red remind they perhaps already have to automatic ticket stamping machines, the passengers in the subway stations Roztyly, Bud?jovická, I. P. Pavlova, notices Florenc and Vltavská. 
At present is giving in this city of five "," shall it be eighty, however, until end of the year, Opatrn ý adds. 
A machine checks the coupon instead of the driver 
The operation of the machines which will work as of tomorrow is simple. 
One must import only the chip card and the before acquired coupon gives itself airs by himself. 
The electronic coupons aren't valid only in the capital as of tomorrow but also in the surroundings. 
Therefore with which the inhabitants primarily reach the capital in the suburb trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499 from municipalities of the region Mittelböhmen. 
"The conductors have film readers with which they can check the period of validity of the coupons to the time and zone in the trains which belong to the traffic integrated Praguely", Filip Drápal of the organization explains ticket control to Ropid. This organization compiles the schedules for the Prague transport services. 
The suburb busses have card film readers at the register with the driver. 
At boarding the chip card doesn't have to be produced only with the driver but the Open card is laid out to a labeled place on the side of the register. 
The driver checks the validity coupons the given oneself airs with that. 
A passenger wants the validity so Drápal " the given oneself airs coupons check, nothing is simpler but to ask the driver for this information ". 
Where the coupons are given airs oneself a passenger on the card who doesn't drive with suburb busses and doesn't know any more when the validity of the coupon ends, in turn can go to the self-service machines. 
The information about the validity of his documents is announced at the display of the device here. 
The Sudeten demanded a referendum of the USA 
The Sudeten Germans had requested the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes to the United States in 1945. 
This results from a letter which is stored in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library. 
If we cannot be component of Germany or Austria, then we would like to live under the patronage of the United States of America at least. 
With such a wish some groups of Sudeten Germans shall have addressed the U.S. president in 1945. 
Among other things this results from a letter which has remained unchanged in a private archive and which is kept in the collections of the south Bohemian scientific library today. 
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president, he in the letter the return of the "Sudetengaus" shall not permit -- this one was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement -- to Czechoslovakia. 
It is said in a letter which is signed with the words "people who are concerned about the destiny of the Sudeten" "we have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units don't enter a German territory as oppressor and enemies but as a liberator". 
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests in knowledge of the Czech national character that they would expect brutality, inconsiderateness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery to the Sudeten Germans, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take on the protection about the Böhmerwald for today and open eternally. 
We "cannot" think that you award this area to one without consideration for the view of a quarter million inhabitants for a state foreign to us which suppresses and has tried to remove and nothing at all contributed to the victory of the Allies purely minorities, has to be read in the letter. 
The reason for it why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge desires of the "Czech oppressors". 
If the U.S. president entertains doubt about the fundamental attitude of the Böhmerwalddeutschen, it is sufficient if he would initiate a referendum about this in the Böhmerwaldgau whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or to live under the protection of the United States. 
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of the after-war history, it draws, however, a good picture in opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans then. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to suspect at least that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only some of them admitted such a possibility to themselves at all. 
Some waited that the United States and Great Britain would negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten. 
Again others thought they simply could stay in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa who is from Budweis also confirms this one. 
He was appointed Budweiser German in the war in the navy at the Baltic Sea. 
When he came into a British captivity at the end of the war and one took him to a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of further Bohemian Germans came to him, he shall teach them Czech. 
You thought if they came home " so Chalupa would get them the Czech to fits come ". 
Nobody of the German prisoners of war which had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war calculated in his opinion that one would him expel decrees from the republic?on the basis of the Bene. 
You don't think, pays then! 
An emotion-laden campaign is aimed at drivers 
The most expensive action for safety reasons on the streets in the Czech history. 
This one would have an emotion-laden medium campaign for himself which wants to start the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday characterized also so. 
The authority of secretary ale? ek expects to achieve ebí with it??, to get drivers of dangerous behavior off behind the steering wheel. 
However, the campaign for 150 million crowns will be going on in watching TV in the radio in the cinema on the Internet also on flyers. 
She shall get the drivers of too fast way of driving and drink-driving off. 
And they also remind to fasten their seatbelts before journey beginning. 
The campaign wants to talk young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least also professional drivers primarily in the conscience. 
And what is shown in the commercials? 
Primarily stories of people who appeal to emotions. 
The "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign also shows it: 
You don't think, pays then! 
The words " denkst not " be in capital letters on a characteristic signpost. 
And then the word "pays" is in a pool of blood. 
This shall mean that one can pay inattentiveness for a moment with the life of his own. 
The commercials will "shock" the spectators to 2010. 
The department could be inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where one can see pictures quite normally with drastic photos of casualties. 
It expects to achieve with it, that the numbers of accidents and the number of road casualties drop in Czech streets so. 
The commercials were of arranged for the agency euro RSCG. 
Stick and a carrot for the drivers 
"The motto sugar bread and whip applies to the drivers. 
Sugar bread means that they save time, if they drive on red, for example. 
The whip is then the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of the risk ", so the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Ko?án. 
And the psychologist thinks information campaigns are therefore necessary in the press and primarily negative advertising. 
Panels which draw the attention of the drivers to a risk are already less effective in his opinion. 
Ko thinks "án one builds a static panel, which warns of a danger, this probably will pass with the surroundings soon and they won't of the drivers be aware any more"?. 
Olmert would give almost all occupied areas back in the exchange for peace 
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has himself for the return practically all area definite, were occupied the 1967 therefore also the Jordan land, Ostjerusalem and the Golan heights if one can make peace with Palestine and Syria in the exchange for it. 
He emphasized this in an interview which was printed by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday. 
Everyone we must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, what means that it becomes necessary to give almost all (occupied) areas back if not cooked " ", Olmert said opposite the newspaper. 
We will unite to the Palestinians " we keep a certain percentage of these areas, but like must transfer a high percentage (Israeli area) because there won't be any peace without this ", it added. 
It filled, that a possible return also will contain Ostjerusalem. 
The certainty in Jerusalem wants and doesn't want primarily that tractors or bulldozers roll over its legs as it has to one of my best friends happened " the one, will have to do without a part of Jerusalem ", noticed Olmert in allusion to two attacks in the town in July, which several people were killed and dozens of persons injured. 
According to words of the premier it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Tempelbern and sacred and historical places which are located on the territory of the old town". 
"The one who wants to maintain the Israeli sovereignty over the entire town will have to integrate 270,000 arabs. 
This won't work ", he further confirmed. 
Deduction of the Golan heights 
Olmert voiced of the Golan heights, what in favor of a discount of Israel an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty is over between Syria in its opinion. 
However, this would require also certain efforts on the part of Damascus. 
My suggestion "isn't" quoted Olmert confirmed to close on the basis of a deduction of the Golan heights of peace only and alone with Syria. 
"The Syrier know only too well what they must do to get the Golan heights back without. 
You will have to do without her present relation to Iran; they will have to do without her relation to the (Shiite) Hisbollah movement; they will have to do without the permanent support, (the hallow) the the terrorism the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network Al-Khaida and the Jihad ", in Iraq grant war the prime minister put in concrete terms. 
Questions about the accident: Are stewards unlawful in the bus? 
It doesn't know the law, this isn't allowed to Umherlaufen in a far coach 
The question stands up in connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student Agency nearby the Italian Padua, whether stewards and travelers during the journey in the bus to and be allowed to herlaufen. 
"We wanted to observe the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward contradicts the law about the traffic so", so the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident a twenty-two-year-old stewardess was killed last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck, the this bus crossed the way. 
The young woman was sitting next to the driver on the least safe place in the car at this moment for all accident although she still had another two places at the disposal. 
However, a bus can have an accident or slow down sharply also at the moment at which the steward delivers coffee or newspapers. 
A role also plays, whether the bus after the registration document also is equipped with standing rooms. 
If this isn't provided by the bus, the travelers must sit. 
The far coaches of student Agency don't have any standing rooms; .cz confirmed what the director of the company, Radim Jan?ura, opposite Aktuáln?. 
"We have discussed this with the department and this hasn't agreed to the movement of travelers first. 
Later has one taken this back, and we have reached an agreement, after what may the travelers go during the journey on the toilet if they have their seat ", it informed about its point of view. 
The law doesn't know any steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward -- no legal provision describes this role. 
There isn't any legal provision either which forbids the carrier to render services, though. 
The law about the traffic knows only the concept vehicle companion; it, however, doesn't define the rights and duties the spokesman of the department adds Hanzelka obviously ". 
The director of the department street vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn ý, however, thinks that the law covers these difficulties afterwards. 
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing rooms in the product admittance. 
All this then is ", he emphasizes. 
Busses subdivide themselves into town busses where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, short-distance traffic busses, with standing rooms and permissible a higher speed and far coaches without standing rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats which are equipped with seat belts. 
Like in the airplane says the expert 
Ín doesn't see any basic problem in the movement of stewards the BESIP expert for roadworthiness Jaroslav Ho?on board of a bus. 
"At a liquid way of driving many dangers don't threaten the situation is comparable with the service on board of an airplane. 
Himself isn't sure when turbulences come and the stewardess can also here push the head." 
"If a bus brakes, however, sharply, then the laws are for physics of course, too. 
Just like in the town bus or in a streetcar. 
The carrier must clear the safety of the stewards ", he says and thinks by internal regulations also that these difficulties aren't solved completely from the view of the law. 
Ura is ready to paint the services Jan? 
Student Agency offers services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company employs about two hundred persons in this function. 
The director doesn't consider her profession risk prone after the accident either. 
"I but the impression gets that the profession of the steward is risk prone as soon as I will paint it. 
Coffee and newspapers can get the travelers at boarding. 
This also would lower the costs ", he thinks. 
As interest in the safety the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin gives reasons for being absent of stewards in his busses. However, his society operates only a fraction of lines in the comparison with student Agency. 
"We don't have any stewardesses, we already fight against it from the beginning. 
This ends with any fatal accident ", sooner or later it intended not quite one spoken year for T ý den.cz. 
This was an unbelievable tragedy 
At the accident of a regular bus to Naples a young stewardess had had an accident from the region Pilsen which had worked for the society for two years. 
The Slovenian truck was probably bent by the stand stripe without flashing and had blocked the bus the journey. 
The driver of the bus tried to make way by a sharp maneuver collided, however, with the right front with the truck. 
Jan denies that the two places have been sold for the stewards?ura. 
"These places cannot be reserved at long-distance connections, they are blocked." 
Company wants to sue truck drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman the agency won't wait for the judgement, it, however, expects a financial compensation also on the part of the guilty person. 
An amendment of the law? 
Not in view 
A more exact regulation of the movement of stewards on board of a bus could bring about a legal regulation a thirty-headed expert team of the Ministry of Transport works on already over a year. 
"This hasn't reached any concrete end yet, though. 
Busses don't stand the agenda, rather the Punktesystem, the maximum speed on the freeway and the use of mobile telephones in case of the journey ín absolutely on ", so expert Ho?either. 
The Ministry of Transport "doesn't" regard the activity of the stewards as something which could endanger the safety of the travelers fundamentally how control of the safety of the busses is, so Hanzelka, in the competence of the police and the maintenance of industrial health and safety standards authorities. 
Hopes of Düsseldorf rest on Frankfurt 
Doesn't there be a lack of great words in the letter of the WestLB executive board to the employees of the house. 
It is said in the letter become known on Monday "the central capital market house of the savings bank finance group" can be made a bringing units of the financial institution of Düsseldorf together with the Frankfurt deca-bank. 
The WestLB would bring in a "competence block" with a lasting earning power to such a business. 
And such a connection can be the decisive annoyance in the country banking sector to further groupings at all. 
Then it gets if an executive board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult time. 
Because the shattered WestLB still is under an enormous pressure. 
Only on the part of the EU commission but also by the Federal Institute for financial service supervision which has only recently made clear to the Nordrhein Westphalian Land government the time is not pressing to find a future solution. 
From a connection taken like always between the deca-bank which savings bank customers know because of their investment funds and the WestLB the talk is also on Frankfurt side already for some time, though. 
Approximately the Helaba has let deca-bank boss know Franz Waas at the end of August on the presentation of the half dates in a fusion of the house at the Mainz secondary road with a regional bank or, the WestLB, it doesn't see meaning. 
But the administrative board has this one deca-, this one are shared by the regional banks and the savings bank associations, engage the executive board to hold conversations about common business activities with the WestLB. 
It could be all about the capital market business or parts of it. 
It has the conversations admittedly, is so called at the financial center, started just. 
For the first time, the talk isn't from the deca-bank which counts Frankfurt as one of the more important employers with its 3000 employees at the financial center if it is all about consolidation in the savings bank sector. 
In 2003 it looked for a moment for a long time as if the deca-bank can merge with the regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate and the Helaba. 
This three federation turned, however, into nothing. 
The plans had hardly got public, the Hessian Land government voiced against a participation of the Helaba in it. 
The two other houses not found thereupon to each other either. 
The regional bank Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg in Stuttgart. 
But there have been intellectual games about a connection of the deca-bank with regional banks again and again. 
Günther Merl, chairman of the executive board the Helaba, had voiced against experimental games about a joining with his house last, though. 
Independently of it, the knowledge of maturing seems, however, that a moving the different houses of the sector under public law closer together is necessary. 
After the regional election is in Bavaria over now, a connection of the BayernLB with the regional bank Baden-Wurttemberg details back could first. 
This isn't a piece of good news for the Helaba absolutely. 
If the pressure should increase to further fusions, the partners go out her after and after for this. 
It would be junior partner in the south only more, although, till now, they got far better through the financial crisis as the houses has in Munich and Stuttgart. 
The west in turn this one has LB for savings banks and bolts unite giro association Hesse Thuringia at the beginning of the year which is involved in the Helaba with 85 per cent pushed forward a join with. 
Had if need be the north LB left. 
However, such geostrategischen considerations are only this side. 
It is on the other one all about the question how the different business models of the individual houses match each other. 
Merl said in June, till now, the decisive question with which business model the Zukunftfähigkeit of the regional banks shall be guaranteed hadn't been answered by the German savings banks and giro association. 
At the end a taking apart also could the west LB which isn't wished there of course, though be. 
So the talk also is in the letter of this executive board there, then, in any case a "complete solution" for the house is striven for. 
Has units brought with the deca-bank under a hat, will let himself be seen still join like this with this single. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as an "Italian weekend" 
For Elena it is already the third or fourth time the first, for Luca. 
But he says Elena as his friend takes part and everything is different so this time. 
A solidly built bearded stands behind them, at the five liter beer barrel of the brand Kaiser and proves the about 200 October celebration travelers which low notes his throat can produce. 
Elena gives Luca a smack, then a kiss first. 
They have come after Verona from Bologna. 
Four busses start "destinazione Monaco, festa Della birra", arrival most likely 6.30 hours the bus parking lot next to the station Puorta Nuova, from here, in this evening at 23.45 hours. 
Three busses are left up to the Italians primarily, Brazilians exclusively travel in a bus. 
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have celebrated already in the night. 
And Marco Guarda so loudly says this is nothing for Italians. 
The busses belong to Marco who wears a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with broad silver hangers. 
For five years they go to the October celebration, these are alone three tours this year. 
At 22.30 hours at night to, during the day on the fair back. 
Stay would mean only unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
The fare, the welcome sociable drink with Kaiser beer, costs 75 euros faithfully -- this Bavarian purity regulations the health insurance and the German-speaking couriers Marco has gone to a language course inclusive in Frankfurt, brewed. 
And the busses already roll on the Autostrada direction "Brennero" in the night. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
It gets quiet in the bus, fast the travelers sleep. 
They still need good so, to become her strengths. 
You hold in Brixen and in lumber churches where quite a number of other busses have a break with Italian characteristics at the freeway 8 once again shortly before Munich, too. 
When Marco's group finally arrives near the Theresienwiese as planned at half past six in the dawn on the parking lot, busses already stand there to the 50 others from all of Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the others collect, Marco gives a last speech, explains the attack plan. 
Firstly: Putting on the yellow skullcap. 
"October celebration" suits on the left the Internet address of Marco's travel agency on this in Fraktur besides that: "conoscersiviaggiando.it". 
Secondly: "If the doors open means run it to the beer tent!"Marco calls, in the morning. 
"Run!" Occupying running and the places in the back part of the tent. 
"Not in front otherwise we and not all yolk caps jam on the same benches, distribute in the room!" 
The measure Marco shouts, cost 8.25 euros. 
And not forgetting tip. 
"Show safety people that we behave well! 
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!" 
Thirdly: "Come item half past ten here tonight again!" Understood? 
And it already works to the fair. 
Away one ties yellow caps as blazes to the trees to signposts and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian people's party. 
One claims to be prepared for the retreat. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende when confessed "Italian weekend". 
There aren't details on numbers; the talk is, this one get on the way over the Alps and the beer tents invade, ten per cent of all visitors shall have arrived from Italy extra at this weekend of 50 000. 
The Munich police are strengthened by seven policemen from South Tyrol which leads nation statistics in which the Italians rank first with about 200 medical supplies in front of brits (approximately 60 uses) and Austrians (about 80), Italian voluntary helpers support the Bavarian Red Cross. 
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians. 
Sleepless nights for creditors the Hypo real Estate 
The German bank system is relatively stable, Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück emphasized week only in this one formerly. 
How good, that the politician used the word "relative" and also einflocht, that the German banking sector isn't spared by the krisenhaften developments. 
Because this one has entered at the weekend now. 
This one in the DAX quoted Munich Immobilienfinanzierer Hypo real Estate (HRE) gets a billion loan from a syndicate of German banks to protect himself from the turbulences on the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday the credit helps amounted to up to 35 billions euro. 
The Hypo real Estate must pay interest on only the part which it also takes up. 
The money comes both of private banks as also under public law. 
Losses are background at the daughter Depfa. 
Extremely quickly, the Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself according to a newspaper report for long period projects for which it has awarded money, what is meanwhile no longer possible because of the distrust on the markets. 
In the first six months of 2008 the bar reserve of the bank had shrunk by 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the return on equity also had easily given way from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent. 
The regular yields and the net proceeds out of finance business had fallen to zero compared with the year-earlier period, the yields from ascriptions to demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolving of provisions in the credit transaction around more than sunk 70 per cent on 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher returns on refunds of after stored charging costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the refund of interest according to the Internal Revenue Code and from the Geschäftsbesorgung for group enterprises the yield minus had dropped. 
In the year 1990, formerly, Staatsfinanzierer had this one been out in its calculations after its privatization at first with commercial property loans which then had been hived off in the Aareal Bank. 
Because one earned too little in the classic state financing the Depfa then had increased in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint ventures of private investors and the state of dedicated (Private PUBLIC-Partnership, PPP) and international diversifizierrt. 
The Hypo real Estate must carry out deductions now on the value of the daughter which will have an "essential material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it hotly rakes uncertainly. 
It is fact that the dividend was cut. 
Already for 2007 she had been shortened around two thirds. 
The Hypo real Estate is an important state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer since the Depfa take-over. 
She is depending stronger than other institutes of the refinancing at the interbank market since she doesn't have any customer deposits. 
With the collapse of the American investment bench Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the credit award has dried up under the banks largely again since the banks hoard their liquidity. 
The Hypo real Estate needs the credit portfolio for a part, about 50 billion euros, the Depfa short-term remedies for the refinancing every year. 
After communication of the Hypo real Estate the financial requirement of the group is covered with the loan until foreseeable future and the enterprise protected "from the influence of the currently largely broken-down international money markets". 
It can be heard from other sources that thanks to the monies the refinancing is safeguarded by the end of 2009. 
The HRE chairman of the executive board Georg Funke explained, against this that must Hypo real Estate Group doesn't become the money markets until foreseeable future any more take up. 
Federal Bank and the Federal Institute of financial service supervision (BaFin) assume that the market ability of the Hypo real Estate group is safeguarded now. 
This stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank to hope. 
But probably doesn't give the crisis any certainty in view of the dynamics and imponderabilities. 
It even isn't unthinkable that the financing doesn't have to be taken up on a full scale. 
The opposite isn't auszuschleißen but either. 
After according to rumor the bank still faced the insolvency on the late Sunday evening the at least temporary rescue also isn't able to calm the people. 
The share price breaks in by 75 per cent to 3.30 euros. 
The loan courses keep themselves quite good against this. 
The prior-ranking debts hardly show themselves busy, the courses of the after-rank loans give way more considerably last. 
The loans of the former subsidiary firm Württemberg Hypo and understandably enough the over 2009 running times going out are concerned primarily. 
If Hypo real Estate loans seem formerly a speculative plant alternative, then the value must be looked at when dependent on the stability of the international financial system itself after the clear increase of the bank crisis and the institute which had fetched the crisis only into the house with the take-over of the Depfa. 
An amortization of the pensions in due time can be started out from as long as the central banks, governments and less shattered commercial banks are still ready for the support of the system, as long as. 
- or else what dares at present to hope for somebody hardly enters that the financial crisis is overcome within the next 15 months. 
But at present the reports estimating themselves with the partial nationalization have become only a legitimate hope from the probability bordering on safety. 
This might prepare long time creditors primarily, whether with the decision some sleepless nights they shall part with their engagements. 
After all, short time investors can final stroke do one use a loss lecture to the future settlement tax payments toward price gains of later years to it form. 
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, shall introduce itself at the Tachibana Highschool on the first schoolday, the girls begin to giggle: "Kawaii" is the Germans totally! 
What this means? 
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas -- it exchange-lied told in the new one of Japan. 
"The first schoolday in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had Bammel already in front of the way to school. 
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of the Kawasaki and go to Tachibana Highschool by train 40 minutes. 
The way I had alone to think I fortunately haven't got lost. 
The lessons beginning seems not fixed at the Tachibana so strictly as in the case of us at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils spin, as of eight o'clock one a short meeting round starts with the teacher until twenty to nine, the 'Home room'. 
But before the lesson started it was my turn to introduce myself. 
I am not the type in front of a class to this from 40 pupils at all yet who likes to speak in front of people. 
Because I didn't have any school uniform yet I have an old skirt of my guest mother blouse, blue knee-socks and black leather shoes dressedly, to this. 
In this elevator I have so gone and in front of the desk stood and tried to say everything correctly: I Sayonara am called Sylvana, come from Germany and have in a week birthday ' where she Sylvana ... '. 
I was very glad at the moment that I had already begun more than two years ago to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have whispered everyone, giggled and waved and I have heard the word "Kawaii" continually. 
I already knew this from my Mangas. 
It is part of the over-essential vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cutely, sweetly'. 
I then have darted fast onto my place. 
The girl next to me has grinned rather broadly, she found an honor that the exchange pupil should sit besides it. 
The rest of the hour was rather quiet anyway when the gong sounded I was bombarded really. 
Everyone talked at once and giggled and holes asked for me into the belly -- it is extremely hard to understand Japanese English. 
All its Bentos then unpacked in the break. 
My guest mother also had made such a Lunchbox to me -- this is something else than the deserted German somethings to eat at break. 
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
I usually don't have any pale glimmer what exactly I eat here in Japan. 
The things look strange and taste completely new. 
Tightly stands, that everything is extremely delicious. 
Naja, except for the plums marinated saltily perhaps, brrrr! 
The Bentos aren't only simply lunches at Japanese schools. 
Sometimes it happens in the hope to get to know the boy at the Pausensnack better that a girl gives a boy a Bento prepared which particularly artistically then gets it ready. 
Of this I have read in my Manga comic strips. 
I am curious whether I also can watch this here. 
Of all things Japan?mean friends asked, as me them told that I want to go in Tokyo to school for a year ' why because ', have me. 
I then have always said: 
"Because it fascinates me now." 
After all, I read best of all Mangas already for years. 
And, sometime, so that I understand the comic strips and the culture better, I have begun to study a bit Japanese, too. 
For me, so it was completely clear that I had to travel here sometime. 
Because I also have a liking for tradition and customs. 
One puts great value and on the here. 
Japan on the one hand is a country of the latest technologies and trends -- it is strict, disciplined and traditional on the other side. 
And because everything is organized so well, I have felt not lost here either even if Tokyo is the largest town which I have ever seen." 
Also rats have feelings 
Flees a rat or a cockroach this means in case of danger that they also feel fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Animals have also much feelings. 
Could one check whether she as only feel the same if she behave similarly like us? 
Contributions of famous scientists have been published in the Internet magazine "Edge" for several years. 
Mirror online presented in a series' select answers to the question "thinks" what to be able prove you for true, without it? 
I think that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without otherwise me or somebody being able to prove this till now where we cannot even that other people have consciousness prove. 
But in this case we may hope at least since all human brains show the same basic configuration. 
And questions we cut, enter a rough area because the hardware doesn't agree as soon as we turn to however other species the feel or quite generally the consciousness. 
If a rat gets into danger, it does the same like many other animals: It plays dead, escapes or attacks. 
People behave like themselves on experiencing a comparable one subjectively infer some scientists from what. 
I don't believe in it, though. 
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer to it experiencing us subjectively of animals. 
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with the human consciousness include the lateral präfrontalen Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution-/ control functions). 
This broad region, with man, is developed much more highly than at the other priorities and seems to be missing with other creatures completely. 
So reason for the assumption that man is even different from the other priorities insists to plan and to decide the knowledge who we are and the ability under this at least at those aspects of our consciousness which depend on the präfrontalen Cortex. 
Another dramatic peculiarity might lie in the language nature of man: Such a large portion it is connected to language, is often said the consciousness depends on it since experience his. 
In this case one could exclude animals. 
But even if consciousness wouldn't depend on language this would influence it certainly so that consciousness-ours would be different himself may be animal consciousness would be entitled, obtain like it also, probable very much of most. 
Therefore is hard to find out how consciousness may look among other animals. 
If it can be neither measured nor analyzed because of the special hardware using our own experience as a little internal and subjective, then its investigation confronts us with great problems. 
Most of my explanations refer experience on the contents of the conscious but still there is another aspect of the consciousness besides that which more simply might scientifically be accessible. 
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without consideration for their contents and this exactly happens at studies of the short-term memory of priorities particularly at the example of the visualization. 
But at this approach which Christof cook and Francis Crick followed one rather resorts to the neuralen correlates of the consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or also not. 
This approach interestingly enough also emphasizes the significance of the präfrontalen Cortex for the taking place of the visualization. 
What gives up for the feelings now? 
I explain it by it, that an emotional system like that one of the fear is activated in a conscious of its own activity brain. 
So what we describe as "fear" the activity of the defense system identified in the brain (or its consequences, how physical reactions) are the mental condition in which we are if working memory covers. 
So seen feelings are tied narrowly to the regions of the Cortex which honor primacies and man. 
Ascribing fine graduations of feeling also others around them next to us ourselves because we can differentiate and categorize conditions with the help of the words and the grammar to themselves connectedly to the language nature devotedly. 
Antonio Damasio on the other hand thinks, for example, that more concentrates, however, the himself, feelings result from more primitive activities in the body feeling regions of the Cortex and the brainstorm like Jaak Pankseep on the brainstorm. 
Since this network hasn't changed itself very much in the course of the human evolution, it can absolutely be involved in genre general feelings. 
I purely theoretically cannot contradict this it regards, however, as unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues what appears with rats and people like fear feels probably also in the two cases that way: How can one check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave similarly, however? 
Flees a cockroach whether in case of danger it also feels fear? 
Bare behavior similarity cannot prove any Erlebensgleichheit in my eyes yet. 
Although the neurale comparison helps along: Rats and people don't even have similar brainstorms, cockroaches a brain against this. 
But the brainstorm is responsible for feelings? 
And even if one could prove this for man: How did one want to prove it with rats? 
I think that have feelings rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows), ?. 
But I wouldn't know how I should prove this. 
And because her feelings are presumably basically different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats. 
At all events progress is in store here at the neuralen level provided that one measures the same with rats and people. 
I don't know how I don't investigate language and consciousness, not feelings, among rats so either, whether anyway they exist. 
One may regard this as nearsighted but I prefer to get on but permanently to run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist. 
Uefa president Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine 
The acting prime minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations would be put by president and prime minister under the direct responsibility soon. 
"The government considers the decision of the Uefa a mark of confidence in Bordeaux in the Ukraine and its ability to organize the EM together with Poland", said Wasjunik. 
"However, this isn't an amnesty for our country. 
Just has with the work started and there is still much to do in the two countries." 
The two hosts afterwards limp in the time schedule for the making or reorganization of the stadia, streets, hotels and airports. 
Even the number of the EM stadia is possibly reduced from eight to six. 
"We can waste no more time. 
We must work with maximum speed ", now the Ukrainian association president said to Grigorij Surkis. 
"The UEFA will constantly keep us in the eye." 
An even more radical step was decided on in Poland. 
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended from the national Olympic committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki after numerous scandals. 
The commission had come together on enquiry from sports secretary Miroslaw Drzewiecki. 
It insisted "to trade the grave danger according to the rules that isn't capable of the PZPN", Drzewiecki told to the Polish news agency PAP. 
"We have assured Uefa president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation won't suffer from it on the EM 2012." 
Several Erstligisten had been condemned because of manipulation to the coercive way down alone last season, even the league start finally had to be moved at short notice. 
Outraged Dennis Quaid hits back 
She wanted a new film promoten, trouble talked about private in the interview, and has now with this all over: Hollywood starling Meg Ryan would out itself her bygone Dennis Quaid as an adulterer. 
This one foams, and hits back. 
Delayed rose war with the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: The two Hollywood actors deliver an unsightly quarrel with each other in due public now seven years after their divorce. 
Meg Ryan had herself the reasons for the failure of the marriage for the first time to this one spoken week passed in an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle: "Dennis was disloyal to me for a long time and this was very painful." 
The extent of the deceit has found her out only after the divorce. 
Cause for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women", the history of an adultery is told. 
Reaction to his outing as a disloyal husband turned out clear Dennis Quaids: It is "monstrous", and umdichtet the 54-year-old told this one "New York Daily of New" that " Meg has rehashed the history of our relation for the repeated time ". 
Moreover, it is, that "regrettable" the common 16-year-old son Jack "is" reminded once more publicly of the pain and the radical changes which mean a divorce for every child. 
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became a father of twins. 
And testimonies close his with the side cut so: "At all events my life goes on. 
I consider myself happy that I have a wonderful family, which very well goes it." 
Prices for plane tickets and hotels drop 
In first half of the year 2008, in Europe, flights and overnight stays were cheaper than in the previous year. 
Flights got even up to 50 per cent cheaper according to a current study in Germany. 
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have got more favorable again, this is the result of a study of the journey and financial service provider American Express. 
The enterprise has analyzed its booking data from the first six months of 2008 and established a clear burglary after a rising of the prices in the first quarter in the second quarter. 
After the prices have increased on the hotel market for years, the overnight stays have already become cheaper in many places. 
The prices in 41 still increased by on an average 6.9 per cent from 48 examined European towns from January until March in comparison with 2007. 
However, the prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year from April until June. 
Most considerably has been the trend in Paris and Rome where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 per cent less as a year before. 
As a reason for it American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate which has led to a relieving "travel urge" of American tourists. 
Financial centers like Frankfurt or London are also concerned by the fall in the hotel prices more strongly than industry locations like Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger. 
The hotel prices hold even the record with an increase in 26.3 per cent in the Norwegian town in Europe. 
The trend still pointed up also at the airfares in the first quarter: 
Because of the kerosene price increase, in the cut, travelers had to pay in the economy class 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, fuel intensive long-distance flights got even up to 29.2 per cent more expensive. 
The prices for plane tickets of the economy class dropped by on an average 12.5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter from April until June, the price changes were, however, far more minor in the business and roof ridge Class. 
The prices collapsed in Germany still more strongly than in other European countries: 
The prices had increased by 11.9 per cent from January until March, in the second quarter they dropped by 23.6 per cent. 
The prices even have halved themselves according to the study on German domestic flights. 
The enterprise explains reason for the collapse of prices is on the one hand the economic growth falling off. 
The demand in many segments of the flight market crumbles. 
On the other hand there is an increased competitive pressure by the Open-Skies agreement which decontrols the air traffic between the USA and Europe. 
The cut unprofitabler ways for Airlines as well as the high number of the airline companies which would have declared themselves bankrupt in the first six months of 2008 is sign of the tense situation, these were alone in Europe for 24 airline companies. 
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0 
With a gate and simple methods becomes the Hamburg SV table leader. 
Furthermore at the Borussia Luhukay doesn't turn out well one to find operating eleven. 
Extending crash-landing for national player Marko Marin of Kristoffer Klein. 
The inhabitant of Gladbach came into the game only late and failed with a pipette to the slat. 
His message was formulated precisely, it went for him convincingly over the lips. 
Simple way knew that it was right him. 
"We need the second gate", Hermann Rieger sizzled in the cubicle walk of the Hamburg arena. 
Much wasn't going on into the was catacombs, the half break ended and most sat on its places again. 
Rieger was almost three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher reputation than many a bygone protagonist. 
And his request was so heard also in a responsible place. 
Assistance coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised the thumb agreing. 
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's boss coach Martin Jol. 
The order will have been similarly: Her with gate two! 
The putting into action failed to appear. 
"Today, everything didn't have to be looked beautifully here", Marcell Jansen admitted later. 
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have it himself " eased wanted ". 
The Hamburgers have the 1:0 (1:0) ; and to thank the header hit of Mladen Petric (for 11.) the circumstance that the weak Hamburgers' very weak inhabitants of Gladbach couldn't be aching. 
"It was a dirty victory", summarized Martin Jol. 
The Hamburg SV gets 121 years old on this Monday. 
On the Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena and the lightning table on the video wall which expelled their organization as Klassenprimus. 
It will become a birthday without a real party. 
"We know how to put this in order", said Marcell Jansen. 
He suspects that the tabular intermediate report stands for the unpredictability of the league more than for the dominance of its HSV. 
The team with its late obliged entrances, the Brazilians Neves and Silva, Jansen wooed away by the FC Bavaria from the goal scorer Petric as well as this, finds itself slow, however, isn't able for it to shine yet. 
"We need more flair and more dribblings", Jol demanded.

A dark matter influences flight of space probes 
For years a mysterious phenomenon has provided when searching for helplessness: A dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing by maneuvers. 
Experts fear that the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins could be not quite right. 
The space probe "Ulysses" flew almost 18 years through the space. 
Because of fuel lines freezing soon the death by cold threatens her now. 
A mysterious phenomenon has provided confusion, the swing by-Anomalie, under scientists for years. 
The swing by is an aerial maneuver of space probes at which they receive an additional swing in the gravitational field of a celestial body, approximately the earth. 
Through this the probes can save much fuel. 
The European American research probe Cassini-Huygens was of use this physical trick just like the sun probe for Ulysses. 
What astonishes the researchers already for years, though? The flying objects don't behave so 100 per cent as one would expect it according to the time-honored law of gravity. 
It rather comes to irregularities in the speed. 
The probes get unexpectedly faster or slower. 
Till now, the physicists couldn't explain this effect. 
You christened him swing by-Anomalie. 
Some experts fear that even the general relativity theory Albert Einsteins which describes the appeal of matter by a bend of the room could possibly be not quite right. 
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still thinks tightly that Einstein wasn't mistaken and tries to explain the swing by-Anomalie with the help of the so-called dark matter astronomers have agreed in the universe on. 
He writes "responsible for the Anomalie could be a dark matter which could also completely be nearby the earth". 
The space researchers have known about the existence of the dark matter only for about ten years. 
Obviously an appeal starts out from her whose effect on other celestial bodies can be watched. 
She is, however, completely invisible, this means she sends and no electromagnetic radiation, particularly flat don't reflect visible light either. 
After the calculations of the scientists the dark matter agrees on after all good one fifth of the complete mass of the universe. 
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free 
Being supposed to the tourists abducted in Egypt be free again after ten days in the hand of their kidnappers as the Italian Secretary of State confirmed. 
The kidnappers had demanded several millions of euro ransom from Sudan. 
At a shoot-out before the release six hostage-takers shall have been killed. 
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt. 
Ransom negotiations shall already be going on. 
Germans get into the visor of kidnappers again and again. 
World online describes the most important cases. 
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free. 
The Egyptian state television, the Arabian TV transmitter Al-Arabija and Italian media reported this correspondingly. 
The Italian Secretary of State Franco Frattini confirmed the release to Sky TG 24 after reporting the Italian TV station: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed. 
We just check her state of health ", Frattini said. 
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions were well and into safety, the Egyptian state television reported. 
The 19 participants of a desert expedition shall be already on the way to Cairo. 
The backgrounds of a shoot-out further remain unclear before the release of the hostages: The kidnappers have therefore been ready according to information from an Egyptian safety official on the completion of the kidnapping before the kidnapper surprisingly killed six the Sudanese army. 
"The problem was solved. 
You approved ", of a ransom the official said. 
It has "only been all about to receive the hostages" when "this surprise" suddenly came. 
Sudanese soldiers had shot and arrested two of them on Sunday in the bordering area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt six of the kidnappers. 
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom in the amount of six million euros of Germany; the money should be submitted to one of the hostages by the German wife. 
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported hostages to it under reference to a German mediator, the release is delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety. 
According to the report the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom. 
The men should as long as held tight be until the kidnappers would have a safe flight route. 
The German embassy in Cairo declined a statement on the report. 
Abuse of the stepfather "led to the suicide" 
It was reported to a court the abuse lasting for years by her stepfather has been the reason that a woman has killed herself. 
Michael Trerise, 57 from Stithians, Cornwall, got a prison sentence of six years after it had confessed eight cases of a sexual abuse. 
The punishing court of justice in Truro learned that was it regularly tied up Stephanie Randle its stepdaughter as it between five and seven years as. 
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for its death." 
The court learned that Mrs Randle killed herself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1st, 2007 in the age of 34. 
When it lived as a child in Coventry Trerise had tied them up and bandaged its eyes before it carried out sexual actions while its mother was gone to work in a restaurant. 
Trerise and its wife sought a divorce into the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall. 
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth. 
The court learned, however, that part of their time which had been caused to her two times in the week worked in an honorary capacity for the National trust, was pursued by the abuse Mrs Randle, uniting the great. 
Public prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends would have said that Mrs Randle who had been one eager a surfer and cyclist has been "emotionally dead" and would have "given up their life" since 2006 
Her right father found Terrance Randle her deadly in her apartment in Plymouth in April 2007. 
It is, that she has killed herself assumed by himself has suffocated himself by means of a plastic bag. 
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter which ended so: "I used to tie them up and to bandage her eyes." 
"I haven't forced her sexually. 
I feel responsible for her death." 
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely displeasing fetishist and for her victim it must have been frightening particularly first sift her was there. 
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim. 
The fact that it is very improbable that the matter would be ended in front of court if this hadn't done it worse is yet." 
He added: "I take note which consequences her deed had according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother on her daughter over the years. 
She would otherwise have obviously been a promising, successful and happy young woman." 
Officials responsible for lost data become accused 
The cabinet official who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June has learned the BBC that gemäss will the "public safety law" be accused. 
The man was deputized by the Ministry of Defense when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo. 
The documents were submitted to the BBC before they were handed over to the police. 
These are the weakest charges within the law and there isn't any reference to a criminal intention. 
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the action has been a surprise in Whitehall for many. 
He said: "You would have thought that himself would explained to thus internally for the Ministry of Defense and cabinet be." 
The employee whose names you cannot call becomes gemäss paragraph 8.1 of the law accused, the clause which deals with the safe storage of information. 
The royal prosecuting attorney's office recommended that the official shall be accused of his work by the Metropolitan police because of the most sensitive nature in the common Geheimdienstkommitee. 
The documents which he published contained classified assessments over Al-Quaida and the capacities of the Iraqi safety strengths. 
He was informed about the decision on the Monday morning and was brought by his house to a place kept secret. 
House-building associations see B & B costs in the eye 
House-building associations could stand British into the house after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank costs of more than 80 million pounds. 
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers. 
The interest for this loan which gets money of investors, inclusive of the 59 property companies, is paid by all enterprises 
The president of the union of the house-building associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was unbearable "" that the societies and their members must pay. 
Loan will be at long last repaid to 14 billion if Bradford & Bingleys loans are paid off this. 
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is imputed to the 700 finance enterprises every year which accept deposits. 
The program to the compensation of financial services confirmed opposite the BBC that the 59 house-building associations are contained in this number. 
It is bitter that these have those institutions behaved circumspectly, ... being now called to take on some of the costs of the institutions which were far less circumspect. 
Adrian Coles, BSA 
It said, that every enterprise in proportion to the deposits which it would hold, must pay and that the societies must pay about 18% of the costs together. 
The Treasury guesses that the interest for the loan on 450 million pounds in the year 2009 will amount. 
This means that the societies must obtain 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year. 
Adrian Coles, the president of the union of the house-building associations, informed the BBC that he thinks that this is unfair. 
It is bitter that want to those institutions these behaved circumspectly, to bear some of the costs of the institutions which were far less circumspect have called now during the property upswing. 
The BSA isn't according to failed society since the existence of the notes in the year 1945. 
"We will watch all aspects of this thing over the next weeks to see which alternatives there are to protect house-building associations and their members of possibly considerable costs." 
The interest which gets due in 2009 covers this off year by the end of March the seven months of the end of September. 
In the year 2010 interest gets due for a whole year and this almost could be twice as many. 
Since property companies are mutual organizations without companions, their members will have to pay for the costs by either higher charges or lower interest on savings accounts.

Sheikh Hasinas long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, became these beginning released against bail month. 
Sheikh Hasina shall return to Bangladesh in the next weeks but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the armed forces supported provisional government should grant unlimited liberty next to it once. 
The correspondents say that it isn't clear in the context of their release although suspended prison sentence was granted to her to be for a medical treatment abroad whether it will be able to remain further on free foot if it returns to Bangladesh. 
Your advocates show off that they will supreme court of justice against the decision of the head court appeal now to this one. 
The upper court has rejected sheikh Hasinas bail request ", because says that she doesn't have to get any bail granted since she already is abroad on suspended prison sentence to be treated abroad ", her advocate Rafique-ul Huq said. 
We will express an on the right complaint against the upper court." 
Your advocates object that she needs bail to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.

New examination in the U.S. American state advocate affair 
The American chief public prosecutor has engaged a special investigator to deal with the cancellation of the nine public prosecutors in the USA in the year 2006. 
The cause was a report of the general inspector of the Department of Justice in which the actions of the administration employees were criticized. 
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and the former chief public prosecutor Alberto Gonzales. 
Became the examination driven by the fears, the advocates have been removed from office for political reasons. 
The special investigator Nora Dannehy shall clear, whether the officials interrogated during the examination have lied to the investigators now to hinder the justice. 
Serious reproaches einschliesslich of a criminal procedure haven't completely been examined or cleared, the general inspector Glenn Fine said in his report. 
With the authority the vocation of a special investigator was one of his main recommendations to force the witnesses to the statement. 
The conflict started with nine U.S. public prosecutors of their offices relieved as the Department of Justice in December 2006. 
The department argued at this time the public prosecutors would be dismissed due to weak job performances. 
It, however, was stated later that something much observer arranged, had been the dismissed public prosecutor doesn't judge worse than many of their Kollegenbe to regard the cancellations as motivated politically. 
Some of these public prosecutors were included in the legal following of high-profile republican convention members while others had refused to examine the reproaches about ballot-rigging of the democrats. 
American public prosecutors are engaged to examine and to follow up legal cases for the government U.S.. 
Any time, you can dismiss, you may not remove for political reasons, however. 
The head of the Department of Justice chief public prosecutor Alberto Gonzales then has come under fire because of the dismissals and office has his in the end gives up.

It starts with an instrumental part which lasts for almost two minutes. 
The song has appeared in the sale in Great Britain as a single in the year 1979 and place has reached 15 in the charts. 
Meat Loafs has, however, " asked outly of bright " spent about nine years in the charts and sold worldwide more than 40 million. 
Meat Loaf whose true name Marvin Lee is Aday has suffered from serious health problems within the last few years. One under this was an operation because of an irregular heartbeat in the year 2003 after it had caved in on the stage. 
In the year 2007 he had to cancel concerts due to an acute larynx inflammation. 
It became known later that he had a cyst at his vocal chord. 
Selling an obscure street in town, often forgotten and perhaps soon 
New York city center has thousands of main streets, avenues, side streets and other bypasses what some famous and others are only comfortable of. 
It nevertheless is even for easy to say experienced taxi-drivers and long-standing local ones heavily where Place is extra because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs of the roof ridge Street direction the north between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching the Second Street. 
She is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and rather looks to a dusty lane than to a passage street used actively. 
There aren't any street signs either. 
It is practically impossible to find her on a standard street plan. 
This street has nevertheless her admirers. 
For example built Avalon Bay, a building contractor, the recently luxurious building on the roof ridge Street has. 
It wants to surface Place extra newly to create a clean passage to the stores and boutiques which are expected in the new buildings. 
The long-standing neighborhood which says it is fascinated by the short lane simply belongs to the other admirers because it is one of the remains of the past of the block of buildings. 
But the municipal authority department which is responsible for protection and erection of the dwellings and is responsible for the street isn't interested to get it. 
During a meeting of the committee for country use of the district council this month representatives of the municipal authority and Avalon Bay have drawn up a suggestion on the purchase of the street by the building contractor. 
The committee nevertheless prefers that the town has the street left in its hands and Susan Stetzer, the district responsible person in the district council 3., has asked for a new plan so which shall be presented next month 
"Only has very little room remained in the possession of the town and we would like that Place belongs to the town extra furthermore", she said. 
"There could be offers, how one repairs the street and what could be taken care of by Avalon operates but we also want that the public entrance remains guaranteed." 
Avalon Bay has announced some months ago which among other things are designed for a café to which the enterprise would like to rent out room the small ones surface street newly and set up seats. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public during the meeting for the first time this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman of the Avalon Bay, said that although the enterprise wanted to use the street it, however, doesn't want really to have it. 
It is "the main concern of the Avalon Bay" to renovate this dilapidated lane and to make a public meeting place, she said and added that the town had suggested alone the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the department of Gebäudeschutz thought it has actually been the wish of the town to sell and emphasized it is rather the task of the department to develop the real estate but to manage, the street. 
Compared with its colored neighborhood The Bowery Place has a little kept a historical impression extra of his. 
Some think that the street has got their name in 1802 when a big farm which belonged to Philip Minthorne was divided up between his numerous children and a narrow stripe country of no-one used. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk skirt monument, this in 2006, was closed, Place opened extra to this and the street is confessed certainly most as a scenery for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones. 
The plaster was excellent, Danny Fields, the manager the Ramones which had taken the picture in November 1976, said. 
The street was full of scrap metal, rags and parts of barrels, Postern, sheets and ropes. 
Some residents, einschliesslich of the Blogger which write about the Gentrifizierung of the East Village, have the idea of the sale of furthermore Place shall publicly extra remain with the argument that these public property, so modest are like it, declined. 
Others have extra praised Place as a rareness? a practically unchanged splinter of the town which should be left alone. 
Named "Jeremiah's insignificant New York" which operates the Blog the book the complaints, (Jeremiah Moss subtitles ": A bitter nostalgic look at the town dying out has a part of the conversation of the town history "), about published Place extra which had seemed "Thely New York" in the magazine in 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, has written at that time: "Place extra is a little narrow dead end which remains dark even during the day and it is labeled for the storehouses, locked windows and week old newspapers flying past to gutters by a rusty metal door". 
With few exceptions the street has recently in an evening looked exactly so. 
A rat ran through the back part of the street, today, far where a more expensive clothes business is not located in the door which used to lead to the CBGB. 
Could graffiti be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle didn't lie on the ground far of a fresh bundle of scrapped newspapers. 
Some passers-by said, they would seldom have about Place thought extra but suggested that the street could be polished up a little. 
Fields, added that people underestimate the attraction of the street in his opinion, some in their current condition. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places which were dark, damp and disgusting. 
Debate around a bilingual education: Education in English-speaking surroundings 
In this version of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates to the bilingual education. 
Leading scientific employee in Kalifonischen studies and leading director in the school education sciences at the Pacific research institute for PUBLIC Policy, Lance T. Izumi, a co-author of the book is " not thinks as well as one: Why the middle classes need a school choice ". 
It is a complicated task to appeal to the Hispanic voters. 
Barrack Obamas suggestions to the education topic are a typical example of it. 
Obamas election campaign mentions, " the probability to lock the school with afro American and Hispanic pupils successfully, this is lower than with white pupils " -- what is correct. 
To close this performance distance, Obamas education plan recommends a bilingual transitional phase especially under others in the education for those which first learn English. 
The question to Obama nevertheless consists, whether its use contradicts its interest for the bilingual education which puts the main emphasis on lessons in other languages than English to reduce the distance in the school performances. 
We take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles. 
Are the majority of the pupils Hispanic and come from families with a low income. 
More than a third party of the pupils from whom many are in the country only for a short time learn English. 
There has nevertheless existed the state examination on a good standard in 2008 astonishing one 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class in math. 
93 per cent of the children were also surprisingly judged from the fourth school year in the English examination when good. 
This astonishing success was achieved with other methods as those which are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its main emphasis on check and exercise on steady control of the knowledge and an attitude which doesn't tolerate any exceptions. 
Furthermore the school practices the approach according to which the education goes in English-speaking surroundings. Exactly this is the point which Obama shall take into account, so the principal Linda Mikels. 
This approach attaches importance to the almost ausschliesslichen use of the English language in the subject lesson. 
The idea more bilingually education declines, said to me Mrs Mikels, this one the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil who had come from Mexico only shortly before this. 12 months later one would be able to enter the classroom and to not recognize it any more. 
"It works", she said, "it works for us". 
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with great share in Latin American and other pupils learning English? 
The performances of the school would make the answer to this question easy but the politico-educational positions within its own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea of bilingual education already for a long time) and its own consistent support of the bilingual education make forecasts answer uncertain over Obamas. 
While he is agreing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently has the trivialisiert topic by saying that people should stop, worries over these make a transitive legislation to themselves in "only English". 
He said instead: "You shall make sure that your child can speak Spanish". 
If Obama wants to close the performance distance actually, it shall carefully take into account education models which work instead of disdaining them and to trivialisieren. 
The oil price drops by the economy because of renewed fears 
It is the mineral oil price on Monday due to the fears that even the American rescue plan couldn't suffice for the finance markets to revive the economy, fallen strongly. 
The crude oil financial futures at the New York trade stock exchange have fallen in the Vormittagssession by 7 per cent on $ 99.80 per barrel. 
The price has dropped by more than $ 20 since last Monday. 
Within the last two weeks the goods markets have both been shaken by Mexico on Wall Street and and of firm whirlwinds in the golf of the finance turbulences. 
After the prices had reached their highlight of $ 145.29 per barrel in July they are up almost liked $ 90 per barrel, around then again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty into the finance markets, to increase this month. 
Have himself on Monday, again, gottenly shown to investors, at the weekend, they would although convention representatives had announced have agreed on a rescue plan which should be the biggest in the history. 
This message was overshadowed of new worries that the financial crisis isn't completed by far yet. 
In the for the time being last chapter of the growing crisis the Citigroup shall buy up the banking transactions of Wachovia corporation according to a government communication on Monday. 
In between, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly have the European financing concern Fortis nationalisiert. 
It hasn't been successful after analysts at Barclays Capital apparently despite the tense negotiations which have taken place at the weekend and led to a rescue plan to stimulate the atmosphere on the markets. 
Since the economic situation further deteriorates it has to be expected the demand for goods, among other things for oil to want to diminish further. 
Analysts of Deutsche Bank have written in a communication to investors, the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have got uncertain äusserst. 
We think, they further write that the goods markets also will be concerned. 
"From the perspective of the goods markets we are, whether the U.S. American got most about this virus worldwide spreads particularly to China." 
The analysts of the bank have made their expectations go down for the oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the next year and lowered their forecasts by 20% for the oil and gas price for the year 2009. 
Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Inside defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything after he accumulated in the jet cotton jersey within the last few paying attention half years more often than every other one. 
He then saw the second quarter on Sunday in which the jets converted an unsuccessful game to a triumphal procession. 
"I have something like that never seen", said Ellis. 
The Arizona Cardinals which corresponded to the bad weather started past a sloppy game with the second quarter between the jets and. 
One 12 yard air down-hearted arrived as a however Quarterback board Favres passport with Lavernues Coles for, this marked the perfect prelude developing cooperation made a giant stride to itself at hers forwards to an afternoon. 
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two Touchdowns, the one slipped as an Aussenverteidiger and the other one for 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
Coles says over the passports "I haven't made an effort particularly" this one to Coles went. 
"He is a super player. 
Our coordination has been correct no matter what people think." 
Played, took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart the defense catch during Favre and Coles. 
Outside defender drying ulna Revis intercepted a throw gone wrong and converted it to one 32 yard air down-hearted. 
Sweeper Erik Smith came to another passport and intercepted it. 
Linebacker David Bowens then provided a loss of Warner. 
The craziest probably was the last ball loss, forced with Bowens. 
The Cardinal had got the ball with still 10 seconds left reconquered the ball in the game conquered as the jets and Jay Feely changed a 20 yards shot to the 34 to 0 leadership. 
These were most points these had ever obtained the jets in a quarter. 
You asked as it "the second quarter or the third quarter" answered Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets, the insanity to describe? 
Mangini said answers the both because the jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without obtaining an only on: "Believe me I have enjoyed the second quarter more as the third one. 
A lot of points was achieved in short time." 
Well rested Gebrselassie beats its world's record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia which has made the distance of 42.2 kilometers in some as 2 hours and 4 minutes has after it has broken its own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday and has become the first person shown again why some think it for the best long-distance runner of all times. 
With the victory at the flat course in 2:03:59 Gebrselassie has a previous result of 2:04:26 improves his by 27 seconds which it had reached in Berlin last year. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26th world's record in its versatile career in which it at least reaches a World Cup title or has a world's record built up to the marathon on every stretch of a kilometer builds with that. 
Gebrselassie has left the Olympic marathon out that in Beijing the air pollution could make its asthma problems worse last month out of fear which, afterward, perhaps was exaggerated. 
He has applied for the competition in Berlin instead. 
In almost ideal conditions at sun and 9 degrees of the start and 13 degrees of the aim Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since train runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed to long distances is the record time has fallen for marathon within the last 10 years by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo has won Costa over for Brazil in 1998 with the result 2:06:05 there in Berlin. 
After its victory on Sunday Gebrselassie has informed the press it would have had cramps two weeks ago in its calf and therefore couldn't exercise a week. 
Obviously he has come back refreshed after break and not rusted up. 
"I am so happy", he said to reporters. 
"Everything has run perfectly. 
I have resumed the training a week ago and, today, had still some doubts but at the end what everything super." 
It was criticized for this him particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa, that he excessively orchestrates his racing runs, avoids many world's best marathon stars generally, relies on the racing leaders too much as if this would be a train racing and puts world's records about the competition. 
But this criticism hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans Gebrselassie had reached the center of the way in 1:02:04 on Sunday. 
Furthermore two Eliteläufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie challenges after the speed doers had gone off. 
Gebrselassie has a little more than three miles from the finish made its last beginning to part with Kwambai which has arrived as second in 2:05:36 and has improved its best time by almost 5 minutes with that. 
Kamathi became a third party in 2:07:48. 
Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakstan and now German have completed among women a considerable year by having shown the siebtschnellste result of all times with 2:19:19. 
The world's record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
The 36 years old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London marathon in 2:24:14 last spring. 
She has the games in Beijing missed because of problems, these as a back injury, described were. She has, however, recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes. 
It has planned its run skillfully by a quartet let only ausreissen, overtook, however, after 30 kilometers her from Ethiopian and Kenyan runners. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia became second in 2:21:31 while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as third parties in 2:25:01 arrived. 
The pride and the hardships in the life of the black population in a town of the quite special type 
Hidden a quiet town in which the pride and the complications of the Afro American culture appear few miles away from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle is located in a radius of Orlando between the excesses of the amusement parks. 
It is Eatonville, the first completely black city of in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, to describe no longer as simply as Hurston did it in 1935: "the town with 5 seas, three Krocketplätzen, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more as enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison." 
Nowadays it is a pilgrim place. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are Zora to the annual one! Festival come in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem renaissance. 
And nevertheless is and remains the town which describes her? federal writer project you produced and this one made her to it to a tourist destination of the outing times of the depression of this to this one by accepting it into the Florida guidebook? in many respects a place of the quite special kind. 
This one is so independently, purely and privately Eatonville like into 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black municipalities often refused in Florida to share their true thoughts with the white man ", so some over us Weiss that he not Weiss what escapes him ". 
Even nowadays in a year about race conditions a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, calls upon for an open conversation in this, many are tired of being watched by Aussenseitern here furthermore. 
We are " told very concernedly about it like our history so Hortense Jones, 59, is ", from birth an inhabitant of the town and a municipality member of the oldest church of the town. 
It must be correct." 
Eatonville was defined for a long time as a paradox of the triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of almost 2,400 inhabitants in which the poverty quota is twice as high as the country average. 
It a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example are on the one hand -- this one culture of the rural south which is sentenced sometimes and sometimes praised -- black which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It isn't surprising that inhabitants are both proud and on the watch here. 
And really the doubts started with image actually around Eatonville with Zora, how here all Hurston call. 
She introduced her hometown to the world like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973) in books which came from hearts and were written in dialect 
Five paragraphs in the Floridareiseführer changed the town which completely lies near the route 77 this one through this often forgotten center of Florida leads to the scenes of black history and human drama, a street. 
First mayor, Joe Clarke, impudent and in the literature Hurston reader led to the store of Eatonvilles as Oskar both in the actual life and turned then to more private matters. 
"It wrote, ", " offside the street to the left hand the modern school painted brown Weiss is with its well-tended gardens and playgrounds about which Howard Miller always cares although he can hardly read and write." 
She mentioned the new husband of widow also -- and wrote that " lee Glenn sells drinks of any type also and what always fits to hour rooms ". 
So in only few hundred words Hurston brought Eatonville with self-government in connection but also with illiteracy rate, second marriage and sex. 
This wasn't quite certainly a guidebook. 
This indeed wasn't a portrait which was valued by everyone. 
Zora "described" the things as they were, so, so one of the Johnson girls who more fully more sexually were allusions immortalized the Hurston by quoting the men, singing beauty about hers the the 90-year-old. 
She added: "Some people didn't like this." 
One still remembers Hurtson as a lively eccentric here, the regelmässig returned after its family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, remembered that this one is conceited in a noisy Chevrolet smoking and dressed in trousers in a town about her venerable clothes style today if Hurston came to the town rinsed off, it usually did this without warning. 
According to the Mr Franklin most inhabitants were fascinated whereas many disdained them. 
"People were always glad to see Zora", said Mr Franklin. 
But it never "stayed", added too long he was baptized in all probability in the Hurston there while he was rocking in his chair on a terrace lain to behind which looks at the Sabelia lake. 
As Hurston in 1960 poor and its books died it was unavailable. 
Together with the large part of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten it. 
Although she was a famous author once, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at the Barnard college into the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived. 
There wasn't any great commemoration, no public readings in the great style, in Eatonville. 
"I don't think that they have understood their contribution in the world or their inheritance in the least", was published for Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography the 2003 about Hurston so. 
The turn came in the eighties. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-track freeway through the town to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow double-track main street of the municipality. 
Orlando's suburbs had already pressed the freeway 4 by the western outskirts. 
The suggestion was presented when Eatonville still recovered in its history from a difficult phase. 
Among other things compulsion had set an end the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality integration. 
The fight against race intermixing caused hate to the community in the fifties. 
"A heap of white boys often came and they threw oranges and things on out of the way sedentary people at this time", said Mr Franklin. 
"Once a woman even gave this one killed it was. 
You threw a watermelon out of the car." 
In 1955 Hurston analyzed the demand of the colonel the decision in the case Brown against the schools inspector in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, to force integration, by it as " offending instead respecting my race " court of justice described. 
Nowadays inhabitants say that this one weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its teenagers them, although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in many a regard. 
Black children were used to being hugged " so N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and managing director of the charitable group to the protection of the Eatonville community one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening ", I remember. 
This could be maintained so long, added her until teachers and pupils didn't come from the same place any more. 
One didn't hug his white teacher mine is availably a cultural ravine there I said to Mrs Nathiri because he was a white teacher " -- ". 
How have, however, the civil rights with positive self-confidence and statements contributed that place was made for further Zora Neale Hurstons, black authors, it did to actor and artist who disregarded prejudices like them? "How himself can somebody refuse my society the joy! 
I don't understand it." 
In the year 1975 the writer Alice got fullers on the way to Hurstons nameless grave and started to fight for the resuscitation of their glory. 
Five years later a Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway praised much could be found in the bookshelves and made them a part of the American literature canon once more. 
The highway project came exactly at a time, the most famous daughter was in the focus of the attention in the Eatonvilles once again. 
And Hurstons saw old neighbors her as a rescuer this time. 
What the district could destroy with the making of the freeway started in 1988 with the planning of a Hurston festival to point the municipality. 
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later and many return for the celebration every January. 
The district turned away from his street building plans for some years later. 
"The plans of a five-track highway" stimulated the town, accelerated the whole with top speed, aroused real citizen pride, said Mrs Nathiri. 
Mrs Boyd a little more simply expressed it: "Zora saved Eatonville." 
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change of the self picture of the town. 
Zugereiste like Rachelle Munson, an advocate who goes here to the church since 1993 and natives started to value the past newly, came more and more. 
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998. 
A new two-storey library (of course to Hurston named) opened in 2006 on the Kennedy surfaced new and beautified boulevard. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still an unusual feature in Florida: sometimes it can feel of the town center of Orlando like a backstreet in the summer rain, only 6 miles as smally as at that time as it was founded by only 27 black families into the 1880s. 
(Nowadays is you to 90% black.) 
Outsiders on the search for the history Eatonvilles and its meaning are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews an approval is necessary in the front-end and certain things like the wall painting of Eatonvilles of the oldest church which was painted of a white and represents black men at the fieldwork may not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like Mrs Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for deep red still fear that their protected community is misunderstood. 
And nevertheless became the Hurston festival more greatly, an increased degree of native country pride also got born at the same time to it. 
Primarily young people tend to see Eatonville just like Hurston saw their complete race: lovely, with all its problems, bad even better and just as impressive, creative and hard-working, silly and mixes like every other races and people group in America. 
It the sincere love for this town is this one one can hear nephews in the voice of Mr Franklins who intends to return to Eatonville after the college who could use a little help according to him, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, to work in the municipal authority or at the police. 
And even the Youngers, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
"Most people who go through only here will think: "Oh, nothing is this town in comparison with all the others", Alondra Kenon recently said to the church on a Sunday. 
"But if one actually stops and looks at his history for a moment, it is a very beautiful town." 
One speaks fluently finance Latin among us here in New York. 
Nothing has changed at first sight. 
If tourists kept away in Manhattan of the newspaper stands and the enormous TV screens in the Times Square, they wouldn't notice at all that they are in the middle of a debacle. 
You would never think that bankers and Hedgefondverwalter which have the monopoly in New York have the worst horror working day over their heads in the shoe box like offices with the glass façades daily since the stock exchange fall from 1929. 
The suppliers still traffic in loud rattles the metal Teewägen along sidewalks and trays transport these loaded with muffins for the having breakfast meetings are. 
Latinos which hang on a yoke similar bar lying on their shoulders still shuffle between Apartments around, load how human pack animals around the 50 pressed T-shirts. 
Clerks still wait for their breakfast bagel at eating states being on the sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow cab on a weekday between 16 and 19 hourses.

Muslemische graves violated during on the right slide in Austria 
Party of Austria and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right Pertei Vlaams importance, take part Heinz-Christian Strache in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17th, 2008, to represent the organization "towns against Islamization", a left-pointing the Austrian right liberal. 
Signposts support this one in the style from signs a mosque shown you are, crossed out with a red line. 
The police accuse right-wing extremists of the grave violation on a Muslim cemetery in Austria, at the same weekend extremely right parties at the parliamentary elections of the country record considerable gains in these. 
In the night from Friday on this morning were more than 90 graves damaged heavily on the cemetery in Traun at Linz in one, action organized according to the police. 
Jewish symbols like David Stern sprayed the perpetrators on some of the graves, detectives, however, regard this as an attempt to cover the motive of the extremists driven by the hate for Muslim immigrants up. 
It isn't clear whether the occurrence is in connection with the elections in any way. 
A spokesman of the local Islamic community said they are "shaken deeply" over the message of the grave violation, this one the religious month of the Muslim Ramadans took place as itself this end inclines. 
A round conscience research lines up in Austria at the same time after the country slipped in yesterday's parliamentary elections to the right. 
The almost 30% of the voices did parties directed the two far on the right good the FPÖ and Allianz for the future of Austria, anti immigrants law showed commitment to their election campaign for a strict one and some of their mottos were criticized by opponent when xenophobic. 
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman the FPÖ which won 18% of the voices, supported a ban on headscarves and Burkas and made even his aversion to food which one generally takes to connection with the Islam known. 
During his last declaration in Vienna he talked about a "European brotherhood" for the prevention of the growth of the Islam. 
Both parties want to forbid building mosques and minarets with the argument that these political ones are symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and analyses which were immediately carried out after the choice and which mean that the extreme rights are the politically strongest block in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who worry in the European Union about their future.

I 'greet' the master Günter Brauer photographer behind the stage to hold his character tight. 
No sales, no ruche, no outfits for the appearance. 
Getting the nature of the great flamenco dancers who do without the concentration and devote themselves to the interpretation around an eased appearance as woman or as man. 
On the one hand artist 
On the other hand personality 
I look into private lifes in these moments which are strange for the audience, I know when I can find a gesture typical of the personality, the depth of a stolen look or out pushing strength of the hands which are gotten because they won't enter the stage. 
In his project 'flamenco people' the German photographer Günter represents farmer change empires staginess of some productions on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarists. He was still little noted for the artists from this side. 
With this suggestion the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco representation at different levels. 
The exhibition the artist explains 'the international importance of flamenco which gets bigger and bigger from the day to day reflects' and makes clear the flamenco listened to, that this one for the program of the month of the photography isn't typical pictures on the stage that, ' it flamenco people can be any arbitrary person then however if one has a look at the photos the observer remembers of artist. 
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to move passion, sadness, pleasure of mediating and with that the audience on the stage. 
To be able to hold the personality of these artists tight, one doesn't have to take any pictures on the stage. 
Your personality and its character is in its hearts. 
What I was interested was this one would create a friendly atmosphere to hold the characters of the tallest flamenco masters tight with the photo camera make it possible for me '. 
Cante de farmer inspired by the festival 'read' Minas, made 1997 on a long journey to itself in the year to take a photograph of singer, Gitaristen or dancer with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture sorting function of the camera and the available material pictures which remind of a classic photography arose. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the classic basis of the picture through which the modernity and the idea are awarded to the picture as the farmer understands flamenco: 'Music with traditional roots which changes and surprises every day'. 
These are not only the dance, the song or the instrumental game to himself but the personality of the artist, his character which seduces the audience with its art. 
The search for the essential after a certain something, which one, in form of hearing his visibly becomes, the firm aim of this work which is presented arms in the gallery of the tbsp Fotómata in the near future is and was. 
Confessed Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente amigo and others belong to personalities for the narrow choice of the almost seventy artists who were photographed in flamenco under them. 
The project became an anthology of the flamenco and will be published as a book with all portraits from the exhibition soon. 
Bauer's passion for the portraits made him take up two years ago once again and put into effect as 'portraits of the veterans of the sports' this idea ('SportARTproject'). 
Although the concepts of the project 'flamenco people' are different the photographer admits ' so I like very much to take a photograph of people, become acquainted with them and put me into the life condition it is for a short moment or one for some time. 
I think that the portrait is the most difficult genre in the area of the photography. 
You meet or push on persons, personalities whom you sometimes don't know at all, or they leave you alone for a couple minutes to be able to take a picture. 
Except for these circumstances I try always as a photographer to put my ideas into effect.' 
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today with the title 'flamenco people' is, in the street with the name //de// exhibited in the gallery of the tbsp Fotómata the himself La calle La Mata is and parallel to the street La Alameda //de// Hércules gets lost. You can inspect the exhibition until October 16th.

He was introduced by Félix Romeo and noticed that, in front of itself, he had an audience which noticed that the Peruvian who has a wonderful memory and great humor feeling wasn't given sufficient time to be able to go through everything once again: how his appointment to the literature which results 'unusual thirst for adventure', 'joy' in reading and 'wanting to experience more than in front of it' arose; as he writes and 'keeps discipline' to complete 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentations, numerous corrections and revisions, he makes this one; this one forming the basis for his stories as Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and which 'memory pictures' it is. 
>> Der hispanoamerikanische Romanschriftsteller räumte ein, dass es `keine Art und Weise' gibt, woran man messen und woher man wissen kann, ob Bücher das Leben verändern, `aber ich weigere mich daran zu glauben, dass die Literatur reine Unterhaltung, eine flüchtige Erfahrung ist', betonte Vargas Llosa, wer behauptet, dass sie `Effekte hervorruft' und `die Menschen noch mehr auseinander bringt', because of this I asked the writers 'not leave themselves' to the ease and 'take on the responsibility 'for its vocation''.

'Sangre de Mayo': Hero book of Garci 
Inspired by 'Episodios Nacionales' of Benito Pérez Galdós José Luis Carci represents the revised version of the famous rebellion of the Spaniards in 'Sangre de Mayo' against the Frenchmen. This is an admirable film in the Filmografie with an around 15 million euros investment for the lathe works. 
Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long list of the actors this way the cineaste has tried 'to represent an amount of personalities and social analysis', what he has always admired at the works of the famous novelist. 
With a film length of more as two and a half hours 'Sangre de Mayo' is presented in cinemas on Friday and shown on the transmitter Telemadrid as a four-hour small series later to these. 
Assured to José Luis Garci, tall fan of the literature of Galdós, that thanks to this lathe work his 'childhood dream' was fulfilled. It has this one to thank Esperanza Aguirre for it, Madrid engaged it to shoot a commemorative film to the second Jahrhundertsfeier in Madrid on November 2nd three years ago of the autonomous community. Primarily because the story on the basis of 'Episodios Nacionales' is based, this one accepted the order. 
The picture of this Garci offers, how it caused the complete contribution of 15 million which was made by the autonomous community for lathe works to Madrid ' tangled Spain which chose the wrong leader for the fight up because the people by the fight for the independence and under the rule of Ferdinand of the VII in delay took had been to represent, the 'single possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding Bekleidungen, '. 
The cineaste isn't, however, that with the financing as in the case of 'Alatriste' or ' //de// ' (twice so high as at ' //de// ') sorry one Lo's fantasmas could, because of this Goya some scenes could from the film script with Horacio Valcárcel, with the Garci almost its whole career cooperated, not shifted, count Sangre be Mayo. 
For this reason Garci which was also a film director in 'Volver are empezar' has played a part by its ordinary mode of operation: it adapted itself to the stage to the actors, with which one must rehearse first before what one begins to shift and for those which hadn't made any casting turned up it ' humiliating a part of the profession of the film director consists 'and providing with respect, ' in helping in the theater and in the cinema to know in the cinema industry in which one works, happens.' 
Many actors they run in 'Sangre de Mayo' into must repeat in front of their camera like in the case of Miguel Rellán Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, Oscar candidate in four nominations it (has) won one of which, is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain this year in front of the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Sangre neither ' //de// Mayo neither ' nor ' Siete mesas //de// billar francés ' and finally also not the select film 'lot girasoles ciegos'. 
For this film Garci doesn't expect any awards. 
At the beginning you think ', that you work for the descendants, you notice later that it is for prospering only and you are content now if one has still produced a film ', Garci declares 30 years work after more. 
Isabel Bayón calls the memory of the dancer back from Seville Tórtola Valencia 
A flamenco dancer from Seville admires a dancer, this one also from Seville tribe. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: its father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it was born in the quarter Triana and when it was three years old, its family has moved to London. 
She was a dancer and an expert for Middle Eastern dances. 
It had a thrilling life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
She was a buddhist, vegetarian and sat down for the abolition of the corset which limited the free female movement. 
The life of this woman who has left her traces at the dance and esthetics revolution between the wars in Europe at the time fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
'I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she has suggested me this role, what seemed impossible for me.' 
We don't try the flamenco dancer said to talk about her life ', special to keep her wit, '. 
Your dance bases have helped me in flamenco much. 
'The dance of the butterfly' happened me, or 'the dance of the snake' like tango like Guajira, for example. 
Your dancing was sensory and it has been told to me that my dancing also lies in this esthetic area ', she claims. 
The production expects cooperating two extremely: with Miguel Poveda who will sing for Isabel at one of her ideas once again how he has done it also in 'La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral who for once wanted to work together with one of her former pupils. 
'Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality. 
I am happy because she agreed to play a part in my work and I feel honored.' 
The production also expects musical composition and the Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga with the song of Miguel Ortega, tbsp Pulga and Moi de Morón; the role of the companion of the artists who were stars with which he falls in love again and again 'takes on too much' . with the percussion of El Pájaro as well as the violet of Rafa tbsp of violet and the cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, it 
In this work one tells stories also in a certain way of the life of this woman, this one in places as far situated as India, the United States or Russia, and in addition into whole Europe was confessed although she has usually lived in London. 
'I wanted to call her back in memory because I think one is she from the women who have an enormous influence on a particular epoch and for whose work no-one still less appreciates more and them because of this today', claims Bayón. 
The idea takes place at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega today. 
The publication of the book 'Diario de Un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium 
In that one of Saint Stephen at a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 married Zenobia Church (New York) offers a corresponding atmosphere to the first illustrated version of 'Diario de Un poeta recién casado' to carry out planned activities in the order of the Andalusian piece of advice for culture to celebrate the 'Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008) the presentation. The aim is the memory of the fiftieth anniversary of the awarding of the literature Nobel prize and the day of death the two. 
So 'the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is ' completed Juan Ramón Jiménez with the new version of this work with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez Zenobia and with the touring exhibition with the international convention which takes place in New York: Which was, and, opened in May 'Aquel chopo de Luz' after which it was in different places in Andalusien, New York reached now and is presented in the course of the international convention. 
The Andalusian piece of advice for culture also has received eight hundred copies from 'Diario de Un poeta recién casado' which were returned by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez Enciso. The person and the work are the aim to make the Andalusian world poet knowner. 
The USA can introduce themselves badly without Paul Newman 
'Sometimes God creates perfect personalities. 
One was Paul Newman of this.' 
This sentence is from the actress Sally Field who cooperated with it into 'sensation reporter' and of the presentation of the U.S. cinema ruling at that time which one let down became, from all of America to Newman with its inspiring performance came and her followed. 
Look, now how much she cost for him to award to Oscar. 
And when he retired in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
This was nevertheless a great blow for everyone. 
'Sometimes what one feels is fundamentally more than an expression and I have lost a tall friend now ', said to Robert Redford crying, ' my life and my country were the greatest Drolligkeiten of its life.' 
No-one was afraid neither to make nor to exaggerate himself ridiculously. 
As a 'father' of the cinema and the native country he has died at a sad moment at which fear of terrorists and of the market collapse prevails at which the dejected self-esteem of the U.S. Americans is on the hopeless search for being based to have dignity returned. 
If only few people whom one can admire stay without virtue in this hard time, then one cannot certainly be for Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For everyone he embodied virtually a platonic ideal of the beauty and the truth. 
Also he was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered both as different losses profits: devoted himself to the fight against the drugs of the foundation this one has and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose up to the own brand of home-made and organic products. 
All this is a present for the country in which much effort cost for him to win through against a fatal diet culture. 
A broad wave of the astonishment beats high over Hollywood without taking into consideration nationality. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man has died but era the whole. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscarpreisträger said that the work was no more or not less than the top of their career with Newman. 
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration. 
This one confirmed to George Clooney, perhaps one of some, today dare to live 'the greatest has us left by all of us' like Paul Newman have a try lived: leading high requirements at the honesty received, a responsible private life, far the camerae away. 
This isn't always simply or not possible in today's Mediendschungel once. 
But there is somebody who tries it and Paul Newman was an example of it. 
He sought a divorce one times and, after the fifty year, was married to Joanne Woodward who was faithful although there were surely many possibilities of being not it. 
For what I should eat a hamburger in the street ', if I have piece of tenderloin at home?', he often joked himself. 
He will be proud of it in the sky that his daughters have the same opinion as his fans on the earth what isn't absolutely usual in America. 
'On none, he was as impressive as on those of the faithful husband, the loving father, the attentive grandpa and those of the philanthropist from all large roles he played', they say. 
For the Olympic Games the streets are unsatisfactory in Madrid. 
Yes, it is the dream of many of us to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012 it really can be 2016 perhaps. 
But I wonder: 'Are we prepared for this?' 
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets I say that it isn't correct! 
It became judgement as perfect street described and mine after, it was the worst street with everything around this and at this which there was. 
Of course this is if one would notice the assessment and I could check it obviously wouldn't something like that be a lot of nonsense come through. 
But we go through everything from the beginning. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen which permits you to go when the former. 
Chip it doesn't seem to me either to be bad but they also should then, if they let already you proceed, give you everything (inclusive, to avoid around the jams in the street). 
So not. 
Here they let you fetch only the ticket (the first nonsense which consists in going there only because of this) and (after an infinite queue), there the surprise is! There was the T-shirt a second nonsense only in the size 'S' (because I need the size XL) 
Where do we live actually, then? 
Or is it so that it was decided after the crisis to buy only small, much cheaper shirts made of less substance? 
Therefore, well, things like this are a small thing in the street in comparison with the days. 
Except for it it is already of at least 15 minutes a queue there that one must go very early to fetch the chip and in addition, one must leave the rucksack. 
The waiting has lasted more than 35 minutes which is difficult to understand in the case of a street where 11 000 people are expected. 
Finally as it also had to be expected, began the street and we didn't have our moving bags in front of that to be left even if it had turned out well once but they to be fetched back had already more difficult. 
In addition, it saw, within these 40 minutes waiting time after rain so that it came to the temptation organize a revolt and attack the cottage. 
I think some 500 people surely will have pneumonia and some like me will because of this chip, which got I have, at the classification seem punctual, even I cannot imagine already that the exit was postmarked wrongly mornings. 
If one would ask me for a perfect street, this street would of course never occur to me. 
So I think we still will dream of a town for a long time which is prepared well for the Olympic Games 
Microsoft on the search for a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
>> Auf der `Emerging Technology Conference', veranstalte von MIT, hat Microsoft den Fortschritt des neuen Bilderkennungssystems und der Mensch-Interaktion vorgestellt, ein Wesen der künstlichen Intelligenz ohne viel Intelligenz, welches jedoch fähig ist, einige primitive Aufgaben zu erledigen, wie zum Beispiel ein Taxi bestellen (oder im Fall von Microsoft ist das ein Routenplaner, um sich auf dem Campus des Unternehmens zu bewegen). The system takes what it hears during the conversation into account. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and Gesichterkennungssystem this 'Rezeptionistin' can recognize how many persons are in the room who they are and remember even itself it can as they were dressed listened and the keywords conversation get on it. 
It also can put in order the persons present after the conversations into the groups. 
In the presentation video 'the Rezeptionistin' notices a third person but it understands that this person isn't accompanying to the group which holds its conversation and that no company employee is either. 
She enquires whether the person here wants to pay a visit to somebody and answers that he will listen soon. 
Everything without the blue screenshot 
Impressive 
This is surely the future. 
The enterprise has better things now for example on the next version of her operating system Windows it can concentrate on. 
One talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft this week. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many tied programs. 
Steve Ballmer stated that, five times, she would then, if the computers were equipped with the most necessary one instead of filling her with the commercial garbage, work faster. Yes, Steven, this only becomes man the some for be. 
Everything is only an observation if one considers that Microsoft caused function and 'Extras' one or others in Windows versions. 
The change of direction is worthwhile 
Microsoft is right, this the operating system loses gradually meaning exactly like the software. 
As Google chrome in the net appeared, was a part of the theory this that it is the first step of Google to compete with Windows. 
Many skillfully pointed out that the browser isn't an operating system. 
The operating system as an indispensable part will always be necessary so that hardware and software can work at the same time. 
The operating system fulfills the function which can be compared with the function of his wife or his husband if it is all about to inform his mother-in-law about something. 
This is correct. 
The system will never disappear but one must think not when an absolute one but as a relative truth of his 'death'. 
What this week told Ballmer is the confirmation of this idea. 
The people give the operating system less attention more, for this the Web browser every time. 
It becomes the computer to execute the Explorer or chrome and every day spend we around the Firefox, started only, more time at the surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'. 
What does the half serve applications in the computer more availably for? 
Some are more 
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than sight. 
Lighten less complicatedly, not exaggerated so. 
More consists the interest in integrating its online services which then finally can become the alternative to Google of Microsoft. 
In the reality they need this without doubt. I bring a small example of it. 
I have the photo of this place in Redmond, made in one of the relaxation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
Refreshment drinks machine is a shield on this fastens: 'Your search. Our future '. It prints a request to use tool of one's own for online search. 
In the year 2006 an independent study added to the end that this one was of use the 66% for employees at Microsoft, Google for the enquiries in the net. 
The new version of the Windows mobile 7 in this by the way also was confirmed last week that delay has turned out. 
She doesn't become beginning but appear at the end of 2009, sooner even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility, Windows 7 and Windows mobile 7 on bring to the marks at the same time. 
The telephone changes into a computer every day. 
The android and the iPhon already are on the market but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso has had it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in 'Blood Diamond' of Edward on 'the godfather' of Francis Ford Coppola pinch on, exactly like Al Pacino into. It is part of clothes of a well built parish priest at the same time.

I am I in addition have to present come to have my sister Penélope and I designed this one around the new collection for these fall/winters season for mango the presentation of the second version gone by 'mango Fashion Awards' and share taken at the dinner in Valentinos honors. 
A very intensive working time which is exciting at the same time. 
You work for the Spanish house what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango? 
My sister, both is also I of the cinema the 50 he and 60 he fascinated years; we find many ideas there. 
I go through a town and watch women, how they are dressed, how they combine their garments, I often do this with pleasure. 
Are you a very versatile woman dancer, actress and fashion-designer, isn't that right? 
I think yes but after all everything meets in one and these areas have many things in common. 
I was small since this, I was enthusiastic about the clothes; I wanted always to go to my grandmother to rummage and see her clothes in the clothes cupboards of my aunt. 
This was incredibly, almost better but to go to an amusement park. 
Already later, I tried always as a dancer to pay attention to the clothes. 
Yes, you know how to have a style characteristic we dancers like it so much of ours in lessons and at the tests to mirror look into it and feel good. 
If one gets the outfit, one gives himself actress in the actual actor role as. 
Everything finally gets connected to each other, it is that way, a lot of respect for the outfit designer and their professionalism. 
You have recently got 30, you haven't sunk into any crisis? 
Oh what. 
I feel better than ever, when thirty years', I feel good. 
I think the woman gets ripe, the life has experience and can enjoy faults with some. 
I am not afraid because of my biological watch. 
I have made the things, I was the small already since this, make wanted and this has given me much inner joy. 
So you consider becoming a mother or not? 
For long time I have known already that I mother am because my body requires this and in addition I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss this. 
I don't worry there what concerns the candidate. 
I become arrange great feelings of happiness for my child and bring it up with a lot of love. 
You keep in it what the cinematic art concerns, eyes so the work at which you have taken part and which was turned last year. 
Exactly so this is and I would like very much that they are presented to the public. 
I as a woman who comes from the theater am very impatient and restless and want to have everything suddenly which of course cannot immediately be. 
I wish very much that be listed for the first time 'La última hora' ' //de// La tumba //de// En busca and ' Cristo. 
Seeing how you like them. 
Days, in front of a couple have you appeared on the Laufstieg with Naomi Campbell, is this correct? 
Yes, is good, don't say to something like that. 
It isn't so that I went on the Laufstieg around change. 
Naomi Campbell whom I have known for some time has simply called and invited to London me to take part in a parade for the Wohltätigkeitveranstaltung of her organization 'women for a better world' and the clothes which we show. I know that two garments were auctioned from our collection for mango to collect the money for Naomis NGO. 
The people don't know Naomi's good heart. 
Many are told to things about her. I as the one which she knows would tell you that they aren't correct. 
I will nevertheless support this good thing in which she is involved. 
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing but, if she comes to and asks me to make a handstand, I also will do this. 
To support the women in the third world what is also necessary? 
The drivers who can get relapsed because of the alcohol mirror will have to install the 'Alcolock'. 
The authority orders that the three had official punishments because of the alcohol mirror, installs in its car this system which forbids him to start the car in the drunken condition the driver. If it is inebriated, then the car doesn't start. 
The initiative was and spare a part of the report now already announced last month in June this one is general public prosecutor sheep. According to her information it is a pilot project which will last for one year. 
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver why this gets a course for the re-education of the traffic behavior. 
Also wanting to as experience shows the Ministry of Transport and the foundation of the technological institute for safety of the automobiles take part in it apart from the general prosecuting attorney's office. 
According to the statistics between 30-75 % of the drivers who were shown more than one times because of the driving under the influence of alcohol, sat down to tax again. 
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it connected is, it measures the alcoholic content in the air breathed out and prevents car start if the driver has made breath test a system with the car; or if an alcohol concentration is stated, this one more highly than permitted is. 
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes the sanction. 
In connection with this, a study which was carried out in the USA in 2007 has shown that cars equipped with this equipment prevent already in the first year after his introduction to 65% of the infringements of the rules. 
One expects in Spain that it could be saved to 115 human lifes every year. 
The measure confines itself to the administration sanctions for two reasons: it get to tackle this behavior, before for a criminal offense. 
And to make its implementation easier, a legal reform can be carried out on the ordinary way and a reform of the constitution which is necessary for the criminal prosecution process nevertheless is demanded. 
The device still isn't, in any business available, although on the Spanish markets it was already installed into some commercial vehicles and vehicles of the public traffic. 
The parliament will take a vote because of the initiative of the Spanish socialist workers' party which suggests to install this system in school busses of all things tomorrow. This was already made in France. 
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes' 
The airplane of the Spanish air force landed presidential hangars of the airport Benito Juárez de México DF, with this prince and princess von Asturien traveled with British punctuality at 5:40 p.m. around the time which was provided by the program besides which. 
The sun went down but its beams still have forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple who got off the airplane. 
At directly this gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities 
I had a couple asked a taxi-driver in the street hours before it whether he knew that the prince and the princess of Asturien went to the town to formalize the official journey. 
Very well, so, Ah, one can isn't people mitnehmen.Sie of hier.oder so at the airport around this time there. 
No, she is the Spaniard but she has lived a couple here years. 
Oh so, very good-. 
But the Mexican press knows quite exactly the prince and the princess of Asturien who are and know the importance of the journey. 
Many which wait in the hangar of the airport and at the red carpet are also armed forces protection of 27 soldiers of the navy who hand in honor salvo. 
The prince seems smiling, it the princess dressedly was informed about to her in navy blue and her with long hair blown by the wind without ordinary 'peep-toes' perhaps that a thunderstorm in DF is expected. 
Before they enter the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers, in this the official retinue waits. 
A reporter of the Mexican television who likes to make jokes waits for her at the door of the hotel in which they are put, one of the four greatest in the town. 
The best quality of the fashion 
There probably was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present the fashion a quality and there were probably no fashion-designer jutting out fundamentally and Bonvivanten as Valentino. 
Mango presents the second version of the fashion competition 'tbsp of Bóton mango Fashion Adwards' for the support and international increase of young fashion talents. 
This is honored with cash prize in the amount of 300 000 euros. 
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first version, have yesterday seen Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement her drawings in the shopwindow of the mango branch office on boulevard. 
This by the way is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a selling space of 1 335 m ². 
The largest business is in London. 
So many events which are connected to that have happened that one would like to thank the fashion-designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship at the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner into Opera National de Paris. 
The executive board table which was organized by mango seemed to the surroundings of many famous people to be spectacular. 
Which one of the pain, Nati, with the heavy heart was tear himself together broken because its brother recently died? He has put the suit of the fashion house on and had some jewelry things of ELAH which were breathtaking on. Held on to the arm of his son Luis, this one is almost two meters in size and has Valentino at the dinner, accompanies honors to his. 
Andik, the owner and sir of the house mango, welcomed the guests and was such a gentleman so that it ended together with the baron of red signpost without jackets because jackets have lent them to the ladies. 
They have hurried to the business, Mónica Cruz, and had trousers which modeled them themselves and a shirt on and for the dinner wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk by the opera accompanied by Goya Toledo they showed us a hall for ballet tests, they have got into excitement, remembered the old days, a bar gripped and made a kind of 'grand plie' that way. 
Didn't follow the walk, Inés Sastre, by the premises of the palace but in front of that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile telephone. 
In the next morning we could be pleased about the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always arouses a stormy enthusiasm, and on Jon Travolta (with bed varnishes of our own and towels) in the hotel Internacional in Paris, this one after his arrival has to have a room without smells asked in advance. 
The stars under the starfull sky of Paris. 
The life Laly oh indeedly is that way. 
1001 advice against stress 
There is not 1000 but one possibility more, around chaotic a rapid everyday life to forget us. 
And, if these are also some, everyone is collected in a book in which it is as one comes to the diversion. The book comes into the bookstores on September 30th. 
Rhythm a punishment is the alarm clock if it rings at 7 o'clock in the morning but the idea seems even worse, again into the hectic one, required which one the current life, reinzukommen. 
The tension and the computer which lead to the backache is called the office. 
This is the 21st the stress badly century. 
But there aren't one and not two methods to fight the daily exhaustion and the problems as one switches off of the working world. 
The number rises however, no more and not less than to 1001. 
Besides yoga positions, the classic massage or Spa treatments, Susannah Marriott represents the whole list of the possibilities, and these to the taste single you adapt, in the book the time of everybody. 
The work against the stress is called '1001 possibilities of relaxing' and the quiet which arranges the book comes so into the bookstores of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK. 
This manual disproves so who thinks that it is impossible to achieve the quiet with the help of personal contacts in the areas like job thinking such. 
In addition, the methods are offered, how one remains in the contact with nature or the 100% natural one recipes which lead to the diversion suggested. 
In your veins no more hochsteigt to establish balance of the body again and the stress has become a problem the moment has come so to sit down on the sofa to switch the brain off and to concentrate itself on reading if the adrenalin. 
Talking in the sleep 
Some children speak at night 
I mean not those which wake up and tell us something what has happened on the day in front of that but the children who speak during the sleep. 
It happens to you for the first time, you will have been frightened in the best case but in the reality this doesn't have a meaning if. 
This is a positive sleeplessness which speaking in the sleep is called. 
She is rather common primarily with the children and teenagers. 
More than one was surely told by you that you have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can appear occasionally (live one times in it every day for example as lasting the high fever) or regularly (one times per week, one times in the month) ., can the child remember nothing the next day. 
There isn't any single reason which causes this appearance. 
Connections with other appearances in the sleep looked for, like nightmares, panic-stricken fear, often are Enuresis noctura bed-wetting, (at night), speaks in the sleep looked for, there, however, isn't any reason for it at night. 
As we have already used to mention it it can to very high fiber, stress situations or overtaxing lie. 
In any case this is phenomenon investigated a little. 
The frequency with which it appears is very variable. 
It can be that one speaks quietly in single words whispers or it can completely be an opposite (cries, wines, long discussions.) 
If the remark is very intensive, it is recommended to the cases to watch the child and to let advise itself with a specialist to check whether there is a problem which causes fear and this way takes place into. 
We have said that it is a positive disturbance therefore it isn't treated, it is, it is connected to another sleeplessness which can be treated (for example with the sleep apnea or with the stress). 
What one can do is carry out one series of simple preventive measures: 
Attempts not to excite the child before sleeping. 
Quiet therefore, choose game for the child and avoid stressful stations which are terrible and a little too wild. 
Among the nervous children whom diversions are recommended diversion methods can be used to help them to get a certain inner quiet. 
This helps the child to sleep quietly. 
Keeping the quiet temptedly, if speaking in the sleep happens once. 
Thinks that it is harmless for the child and, the next day, it will be able remember nothing which has happened. 
Useful advice 
Don't wake it up. 
This is useless because the child is unconscious, you will wake it from the sleep so. 
Although the child speaks, it sleeps therefore it rests. 
It thinks if himself shows after a couple to appearances frightened it is recommended so to let advise himself or to find out which reason the child has for the fear. 
If they understand what it says (what is not so ordinary), the child doesn't put under pressure to carry out an examination and get more information back. 
So you will be able achieve nothing with that because if the child sleeps, it is unconscious and can't think. 
In addition, you will hear what it says but you won't know what it dreams and they are carefully conclusions with the interpretation of the information and this one which you draw from it because of this why it says this. 
It perhaps doesn't say to the child that hear this at night and know its secrets for her. 
Not even as a joke. 
This causes a lot of fear. 
So nothing bad causes you no worries, it is, this is a moment which lasts for only few minutes. 
Illhäusern ... finite 
After a long lean period Illhäusern is on a run of success on the field finally again. 
Himself without a great effort erspielten and the yellow black managed to convert one of this and to win the game so numerous scoring chances. 
The speed of this meeting with which the attackers had trouble, their knowledge to point, wasn't very high. 
After a first attack of the guest captain Kauffmann whose far shot only just passed by the angle shot Illhäusern should dominate the game with no trouble at all and only Fonderflick turned out well alternately with a far shot, then brain with a high passport and Romain with one with the toe, the defense Denmark to challenge. 
The opposing team blocked in the country middle and let through only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm. 
Should be decisively the beginning of the second half at first two scoring chances and the same won by Riahi and temporal after those with the first gate for the Illhäuser by Marais which exactly stood correctly around again this one, into a first test of Diebold fended off been assume a ball had. 
But the illhäusische goal scorer should be able to not enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent on the bank about twelve minutes later, through what his team comrades had numerically to play on inferiorly. 
However, Denmark didn't know how to make use of it and didn't pit any great problems against an illhaeusischen eleven which only a little retired around its defense to 'increase' unless within the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed by the slat after a great mess very near. 
Sarkozy meets furious fishermen 
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy still will make an excursion to Brittany. 
In view of the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked the driveways to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday the French president decided to come in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday mornings to meet there the representatives. 
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he comes with 'concrete suggestions'. 
This one finds the visit of the president a record value instead of as a general meeting of the crisis committee which was founded by the Breton fishermen to succeed with measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price of has reached more than 1.14 euros per liter on an average at the same time. 
The president will discuss possible solutions with them according to the press agent of the Elyséepalasts David Martinon to help their enterprises to get competitive again and secure for the job conditions and the payment of the sailors. 
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination. 
On Tuesday mornings they led protest marches in the Morbihan and calvados at, which caused jams of almost ten kilometers length. 
The sail port of Quiberon also was blocked, the connections to Belle île, however, didn't break off. 
The peninsula Quiberon was fenced off with a lock. 
Already on Monday the sailors of their determination expressed by burning of the early morning to tires and pallets in front of the fuel depositories of the ports of Brest and Lorient while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint Brieuc. 
The movement expanded on other ports of the Atlantikküste and the Channel, such as Sables ' this where Olonnes didn't drive the fish cutters out in Vendée or where about twenty boats blocked, Le Havre, the maneuvers of the merchant ships. 
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique resolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening. 
These from Boulogne-sur Mer decided to wait in the department for the course of the meeting on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures. 
The crisis committee must actually decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in Guilvinec at the discussion planned in the department for farming and fishing in Paris. 
But some Breton fishermen don't claim to be deputized by the persons responsible of the national fishing committee which hasn't supported their movement. 
'The strike will go on' because the fishermen 'won't' give way in any point and 'don't want to go to Paris', announced Liliane Cariou, president of the fishing committee of Lorient, for example. 
Currently, the liter costs the professional fishermen whom no taxes pay on diesels about 50 cents but they think that the limit of profitability of a boat can be achieved only with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.

Obama, winner after points in the first TV duel 
On the first debate of the two candidates for the White House of the Friday a further one followed John McCain or Barack Obama to find out who resulted as a winner from it. 
As expected the QGs announced for the choice both the republican and the democrats their own victory in this TV duel which should be pursued by a third of the American families. 
The political analyst David Gergen guesses that John McCains performance wasn't 'brilliant' enough although quite considerable to make it possible for him still to stop his fall in the choice surveys five weeks before the presidential elections. 
The Gallup institute by which an opinion poll was published on Saturday which lies according to Obama with five points in front (49% to 44% for Mccain) thinks that the democrat makes the better figure obviously. 
With the still undecided voters, that is the ones it depends on now, Obama resulted with 39% as a winner from the surveys while according to a CBS survey 25% of them are considering Mccain a winner. 
Obama should lead is expected with the good performance, the one of its fellow applicant Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with its rival Sarah Palin, on Thursday, his can confirm 
'It would be a fault to underestimate her. 
She has good instincts ', this weekend Bill Clinton warned, however. 
The seventy-year-old Mccain didn't stop moving his unquestionable experience in the field of the foreign policy to the foreground and underlining the 'naivety' of his opponent quite considerably regarding these questions which formed the center of this first TV duel. 
Senator Obama doesn't seem he emphasized several times to understand ', that ... '. 
In addition, he assured 'I don't think that senator Obama has the necessary experience and the required knowledge to become a president'. 
A target is, lectured to choice commercials this one since yesterday in the republican. 
Obama itself emphasized that it represents the future. 
He spoke shortly and precisely without having anybody bring himself from the setting. 
He moved his ability to the foreground to take good decisions and to replace the picture which has the world of the United States. 
Mccain still hasn't understood, it was to have accused of to Obama in the republican, however, spare, on the other hand, a democratic choice commercial put this weekend grasped not the complete extent of the crisis which weighs heavily on the 'American of the street' '. 
During the 90 minutes John McCain had to tell the debate a lot of things over me ', but nothing over you ', Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had assembled on the occasion of a choice event in north Carolina in pouring rain. 
He mentioned not even the words 'middle classes' or 'worker'. 'The financial crisis provides the Americans to Obama, this one for keep the most suitable even still to save the economy on the edge of the precipice, a clear advantage. 
The next week 'could' represent a decisive turning point, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer estimated yesterday. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the government Clinton, compared the 'good economic instincts' Obamas with these of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the democratic candidate the short-term crisis 'the degree verdict of an eight-year bad economic policy which has been converted by George Bush and supported by senator Mccain' has. 
After he had emphasized once more that he even would manage well to cut the taxes for 95% of the Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energetic independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies together with the introduction of a health insurance system for him would have a topmost priority. 
Mccain however wanted to build a plant to 2030 out of 45 nuclear power stations. 
The two candidates evaded the himself carefully the questions, on the plan for the rescue of the finance market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) which was adopted by the convention last night and is extremely unpopular with the people. 
'Have you remarked that a choice took place in Minsk?' 
Teenagers and opposition demonstrated evening on the main place of the Belorussian capital on Sunday to decline the results of the parliamentary elections already in advance. 
Some hundred White Russians assembled Sunday evening since shutdown of the polling stations on the market place of Minsk, to protest the deceitful character of the parliamentary elections. 
Although no result had been announced yet, numerous teenagers had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: 'The dictator shall step down'. 
Some admit that they haven't voted first at all: 'What uses what, if they make voices anyway with mine anyway, they want', says a teenager. 
You don't think that the regime which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light to resume the negotiations with the European Union is ready to perform a democratic turn. 
The sanctions, among this the Nichterteilen of VISA for 40 leading Belorussian personalities and the Aufeislegen of certain fortunes, could be lifted if these elections were assessed by the observers when clean. 
According to the opposition they weren't it. 
Heterogeneous association of twelve parties 'we were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the counting', one Juri Potemkin, press agent of the union of democratic strengths, was sorry. 
Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the presidential election in 2006 and leader of the pro-Europe movement, emphasizes this is a cosmetic change because it is of importance, who counts the voices and is this the executive with us. 
If representatives of the opposition move into the parliament then because they were appointed and not voted. 
But her move to the parliament can mean broadcasting time on the television, meeting in the regions and law suggestions. ' 
So the opposition owes itself to interfere in the political game because the dialog with the European Union must ' be opened. 
Our economy which is responsible opposite Russia strongly gets into a crisis and we don't reform each other, we run the risk of becoming a patronage of Russia because if. 
Well, we claim to be independent '. 
The opposition fears that the organization for safety and cooperation in Europe which has pursued the choice course doesn't respect the choice as valid. 
She emphasizes that the poll numbers seem too high and that the expansion of the voting has in advance paved the way (for 26% of the voters of Minsk) for any kind of manipulation. 
'Year has noticed you, that a choice has taken place?, the leader of the social democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the two last political prisoners, asks this one this in August you released. 
Nobody was in the polling stations. 
And it will be at most five representatives of the opposition in the parliament and although those, these correspond to the ideas of the government most likely. ' 
The silence of the night sinks over the October place again. 
President Lukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission congratulate themselves on their success on television. 
Discussion got sure -- of the blood, that again 
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to be happy because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks of the world. 
And she has primarily recovered the confidence of the public which had deeply been shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood within the 1980s and 1990s years. 
As one knows, the national blood reserves managed by the donation of blood service of the Canadian red cross were contaminatedly hepatitis C virus with the hi virus and this during the 1980s years. 
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public the government of Canada started an examination in February 1994 which is public and escorted by the judge Horace Krever which aimed to take light to the circumstances which had led to such a tragedy and to work out guidelines to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this type. 
At that time, while judge Krever still was hesitating to hand in his report, several provinces adjusted a committee to the legs whose aim it was to develop a new system for the administration of blood preserved foods in Canada. 
The committee fulfilled Gélineau this order in Quebec. 
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec which is responsible for Quebec and the Canadian blood company, provide around the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998 when Hema-Quebec has taken her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood preserved food system in Quebec, Dr. Décary remembers. 
The situation was discouraging. 
It says before it emphasizes proudly that almost 94% of the population of Quebec had confidence in Hema-Quebec at the beginning of 2008 meanwhile won back to improve the safety of the blood preserved foods and we have the confidence of the public by the work in this field during the following years by the enormous efforts '. 
Dr. Décary keeps, however, that ' a little extremely fragile in the consciousness confidence is '. 
Since its foundation on September 28th, 1998 Hema-Quebec acts according to the principle of the caution. 
We saw the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of the Mad Cow Disease, a new nature of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness, in Europe at that time, this woman who holds the line since the foundation in 1998 says. 
'And we didn't have the slightest idea whether this illness over the blood could be transmitted. 
Therefore we referred to one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau according to which one uses exclusion measures if one doesn't know this and if an illness progresses only slowly as obviously it is the case at the Creutzfeldt-Jakob illness which speaks by a degeneration of the brain what inevitably leads to death. 
Therefore one didn't accept blood of persons who had stayed in the United Kingdom longer than a month since 1980 in April 1999. 
Well, it was proved some years ago without any doubt that this illness over the blood is transmitted. 
So the principle of the caution has shown us this event that has, the used, absolutely a meaning. 
A much more exact technology turned up for the reconnaissance of HIV on the market in 1999: At the tests used till now how it was the case the nucleid acid tests (NST) which make it possible to prove the occurrence of the virus itself in the blood of the donator directly and not that one of the antibodies against the virus. 
The NST made it possible these between the time, to shorten the incubation period to which the person was infected and this, if the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, takes place, explains the specialist. 
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week. 
So became the risk that certain donators could be infected without knowing it and one couldn't recognize this, reduced fundamentally. 
These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk in considerable measure of transferring AIDS about a blood transfusion. 
Nowadays one runs the risk of from 12 million persons getting blood infected with HIV. 
'With other words this means that one must distribute 12 million blood preserved foods before somebody would be infected with HIV. 
Since Hema-Quebec distributes every year between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserved foods, it would last more than 24 year before a case appears, was transferred at the HIV about a blood preserved food. 
I think that nowadays one can feel comfortable with if one gets a blood transfusion or prescribes to restore the health ', the management boss of Hema-Quebec thinks. 
'It is our challenge for the next ten years to get the safety of our products. 
One never knows which pathogene can reach the system. 
Only last year the Chikungunya virus which is transmitted by insects over the blood just like the Westnil virus has appeared on the island of Réunion. 
We must supervise ', incessantly Dr. Décary continues before she emphasizes that Hema-Quebec in addition must provide a sufficient supply besides a safe supply. 
'The need increases because the population ages. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive for the cancer fighting the patients often need new red blood corpuscles or blood small plate. 
The increase in the percentage of old people of the population also has an effect on the blood donor net, to this on average only 3% suitable this one to this donations of blood inhabitants of Quebec belong. ' 
Every healthy person can, the 18 years or is older and the suitability criteria satisfies, everyone donates blood to 56 days therefore six times in him year. 
On average 14% of the persons who make their blood available are adopted not because they have fallen ill with AIDS or malaria, for example and who has traveled to a country, malaria is common in it, donations of blood get impossible for a year of this. 
'With these 3% we manage to get an inventory which corresponds to the needs of the hospitals. 
Lacking stocks are very rare. 
But one must replace the members of this donator net if they can get older and donate no more blood. 
It is primarily but, hard to convince people to donate blood think them and get them to become regular donators. 
Nowadays the life is so hectic that one seldom finds to spend donations of blood an hour the time ', Francine Décary is sorry. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema-Quebec doesn't deliver only blood preserved foods but also human fabrics among this bone transplants, cardiac valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively at heavy fire injuries. 
These fabrics are examined, treated and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank of Quebec. 
Rich blood is to stem cells which can serve to treat serious illnesses, such as leukemia, in the umbilical cord who was regarded as a biomedical waste earlier. 
'Some weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test and we plan to remove more than one thousand every year. 
Dr. Décary further explains 'we should start well at the beginning of next year to make it available' for transplants, which when very popular describes this program the umbilical cord blood removal. 
Many mothers 'are' convinced to not have access to it in all hospitals of Quebec offer because Hema-Quebec lacks the means, this complex and costly program.

But I think he has liked the end of the game. 
He received a stormy approval. ' 
Charest backs the north 
The prime minister doesn't exclude still to start elections before the end of the year. 
Yesterday, as soon as the general meeting of the liberal party came to an end, Jean Charest went after Jean talon in Quebec where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (the Left) tries to be elected in today's partial choice. 
'Moving the course of our last great limit in the north': This is the long-term aim which introduced Jean Charest with visual means during the general meeting of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis yesterday in which he completely followed the guidelines. 
During his lecture a kind of picture mill was projected behind him. 
Spectacular pictures of hydroelectric power stations, mines of Quebec in 'Google Maps' looked at, maps etc., turned on three gigantic screens. 
Large means like during the legislative period. 
The prime minister refused opposite the press by the way to rule out that he will hold the elections this fall even if he indicated that his appointment book is very full. 
The 'plan the north' is the fourth element of a 'vision' which the prime minister has allegedly for Quebec, namely that one of a 'new working area', this agreement with France regarding workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario provides. 
Although it was frequently mentioned in the speeches of the prime minister in the last time, the opening of the north, the northern area on the 49 sten degree of latitude, had never been topic of a presentation. 
The prime minister confined himself to it, however, why explain oneself the north 'a jewel with an enormous potential' be, no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for the coming projects, however, called. 
At the most some views of on what more could be worked: Primarily at the water energy on the woods but special at the mining sector favored by the growth of the fast-developing nations and the renewal of the public infrastructures. 
According to the enumeration Mr Charests the north 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, Titan and even diamonds' has. 
Area is in our proximity, is in Quebec twice as big as France this '. 
How it isn't only in our proximity, it is in us ', he emphasized, around clear to show that he tries to put a national founder dream into effect? 
He emphasized Quebec has grown very much by its connection with the north: the street to the gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James bay. 
'It belongs to us', it is our future, he added after he had had a theatrical break to look at the gigantic card behind himself. 
The prime minister of the press opposite explained the north, 70% of the area of Quebec, surrounds a part of Labrador which Quebec always called in. 
'This is a traditional attitude which all governments followed up. 
There is a border at which hasn't there been any agreement for very long time if the opportunity offers itself I will take this attitude in the name of the government again ', he explained himself. 
In addition, he declared 'we must reconsider our vision newly of the north' with the climate change and talked about the northwest arcade which will be passable due to the thaw the whole year. 
The prime minister thinks against this new geopolitical background that it is a duty virtually to occupy this area. 
And the inhabitants of the area, the natives and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of Quebec would handle them very cautiously and that they would profit from this project the boys primarily. 
Two former secretaries of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pekistischer representatives of Ungava) have already started consultations among about thirty communities. 
A secretary committee escorted of Benoît Pelletier in which Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) takes an important position has taken the work. 
The prime minister doesn't exclude a great meeting one a common vision will itself create, ' not unconditional a peak ', but an opportunity, at which ' '. 
The development of the north will take place as for the rest in agreement with the principles of the sustainable development. 
he promised the plan the north will be 'discussed, regulated and environmentally harmless'. 
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as if it is a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers which were in the office in front of him. 
'How the liberal ones which were in the office in front of us do we have changed to convert the challenges to new growth and Entwicklungschanchen? 
This was by the way one of the topics of the weekend which was opened by Jean Lesage with a great cocktail party for the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the take-over of the party leaders on Friday raised again and again. 
One of the adopted decisions intends to rename the power station of Beauharnois in Adélard-Godbout dam. 
From Godbout which has created Hydro-Quebec about Lesage which has reached the quiet revolution and the nationalization of the water electricity to Bourassa this one has made the James bay, knew our party always ' to determine ', Jean Charest declared, the future. 
It referred to a different one, this time conservative plan cover, and to be more precise to the program ' Roads to The North ' of John Diefenbaker, prime minister of 1957 to 1963., opposite the press 
With respect to the project water-power dam Eastmain1a-Ruper which is whose putting into operation for provided in 2012 Mr Charest emphasizes. 
'This remains under us but I intend to take part', he trusted his party members on what caused approval storms with those. 
The prime minister who has that 2008 and surely either 2009 wouldn't become elections geben said in April has the possibility of holding an election this fall, what, for it indeed from the law possibly is, not excluded yet. 
He emphasizes primarily because of a mission of the community advice in China and a peak between Quebec and New York that his appointment book is, however, full. 
The general meeting of the weekend provided the liberal party leader with a platform from nationalistic plans primarily from 'aims concerning the constitution' which were accepted straight away: The PLQ demands quite particularly the recognition of the unusual feature 'of Quebec' in the constitution. 
She also would want that Quebec appoints members of the advice of the Canadian broadcast and telecommunications and that these have a veto regarding the decisions made in Quebec. 
On the part of the opposition the guidelines of the plan the north were taken with scepticism. 
The boss the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has the north you got back the politics got Quebec out again, has this one established the government Landry 2001 for the development. 
The liberal government has done without according to her when it came to the power in 2003 using these. 
Today, if it had done it, we 'would' already be much further Mrs Marois on the side of her candidate judged in Jean talon (where the choice takes place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has declared in favor of supporting the acceptance of a plan the north by the government. 
'But' what we want is that this becomes not only a great performance the party leader declared Sébastien Proulx into representation for Mario Dumont who comes back today from the vacation. 
Letters, a dishonored country 
It was Mr Vic Toews, all over-'justice' secretary (which one irony) in the high quality German white wine Harper which permitted itself to say over Louise Arbour last summer she is a 'disgrace' for Canada. 
This woman himself who has waged a fight for the justice not wanting to end and all our admiration deserves to cover with ignominy so says just as much about the persons, like around the prime minister about Stephen Parker. 
We have to do it here with a government which hasn't fetched their compatriot captured in the concentration camp Guantanamo as the only one home from all the countries concerned. 
A government which doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things which he is accused of happened. 
The only government which breaks its word and lets a child soldier eke out a miserable existence under inhuman conditions despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva convention. 
This one condescends for a justice parody to assess the fault of the defendant the only ones. 
We call each other, that in memory UNICEF, Amnesty International and the union of the Canadian advocates of it plead primarily to fetch Omar Khadr home so that he gets a just process in Canada. 
Exactly this government also locks the eyes before the torture: It interests little that a young adult surely will be broken for the pain spiritually after so many years for ever. 
We aren't still conscious of this one but we just experience an insidious curtailment of our rights, our liberty and our 'democracy', this word which permanently carries Harper like a flag in front of self here and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth, here. 
So it has come the time at which there are no more morals: One may completely maltreat, torment and lock in a Canadian citizen arbitrarily after discretion of a head of the government, to this day, which only is supported by the minority (he may completely belong ... with the minority) after October 14th. 
Many voters think to find their well-being at a party which preaches virtue, law and order. But they don't see that this government has renounced what agreed on the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this breakaway and nowhere differently. 
Liberal opinion, Orwell's talk of Barrick gold 
In her version of September 17th Le Devoir published a letter of Mr Patrick J. Garver, vice-president of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms and the largest gold extraction company of the world one of Orwell's logics pursues that a little publishing house without means strove for a slander action more than six million against three authors and one with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they don't judge the truth primarily not in the case of slander actions but the law. 
As expected this basic difference was hidden by Mr Garver completely. 
Because for Barrick gold the best way to lead a public debate to drive everybody into the ruin which dares to hold an opinion set against hers is. 
Identically the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will as the process ends spend considerable sums, these must to prepare their defense and fight with very dissimilar weapons against an army of advocates be paid to the gold mine from the almost inexhaustible bags. 
The tactics at these dissimilar fights are as for the rest often to ruin the defenders to force a conjoint regulation which the opposite side silences and everybody in addition deters, which dares to deal with the question once more. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, it ought to have presented its view of the things with the public opinion. 
What unlike this and would pass through, into much the countries walk in which Barrick gold works are, debates are usually delivered by the exchange of ideas and not by stick strokes in Canada. 
So it would have sufficed by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent examining teams which could have brought light in this question if the gold mine had disclosed her books and files and opened an actual debate. 
But Barrick gold doesn't seem to have confidence in the public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to the support of the authors of Noir Canada with a gesture aside. 
Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate simultaneously and the opinions just disregard for this public really? 
This word apparently contains only the generously paid advocates and not the community of all Canadians in the world of the vice-president; a quite beautifully cramped position of the concept. 
Slanderers have the right in a democracy to speak themselves. 
What Barrick gold doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand are that the public which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada primarily therefore does this because it declines the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments and many are aware of it not in a frame as a gag complaint (Barrick gold hasn't judged a demand on the authors of Noir Canada, in which asked it of them in the course 'of the public debate', this concept, just any more to put ...). 
Refrained from the surreal talk by Mr Garver the complaint is a direct attack on the liberty for the academic research and the establishment of the truth of Barrick gold which are basic every democratic society. 
She denies completely the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations which form the base of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to investigate and to discuss topics which the rich enterprises of this world don't like, otherwise who can do this then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could lead these by following the scientific norms which were used by Noir Canada of the authors. 
She has a right to answer. 
For a long time, the universitäre environment to which we belong has known how to get a grip on debates and discrepancies and to solve conflicts. 
The unverhältnismäßige complaint of Barrick gold shows clearly that it doesn't feel like a transparent debate unlike what it provides. 
This is a loss for the university world, just like for the public debate and it becomes time that the governments take up measures which limit this type of unjustified complaints. 
Democrats and republicans get on rescue operation for Wall Street -- 
Yesterday, the administration Bush and the leading convention representatives, republican and democrats finally came to an agreement about the most extensive economy rescue plan similarly, since the deep depression of the thirties. 
The new version of the plan over 700 billion U.S. dollars which shall stop the financial crisis which shakes Wall Street already for months still must be accepted by the two convention chambers. 
The main contents are: Better control of the representatives over the practical application of the plan to check new mechanisms around the number of houses impounded due to payment delays to safeguard the repayment of the invested public funds, new disposals, as well as the right to supervise the salaries, these to the leading ones, supported employees the enterprise paid be. 
Finance secretary Henry Paulson, the president of the representative chamber Nancy Pelosi, and this one during the negotiations announced representatives of the republicans, senator Judd Gregg, present the American after a two-day negotiation marathon yesterday some minutes after midnight, the good news. 
'We have made great progress in the direction of an agreement which will be market effective', explained the representative of the administration Bush, Henry Paulson. 
'Everything happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis on Wall Street', explained the democrat. 
'This is the basic point: If we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disturbances will be enormous ', in the daily life of the Americans the republican explained Judd Gregg. 
During the last two hours, the negotiations had accelerated themselves for fear of the effect which would have had a renewed failure on the atmosphere of the investors. 
The period which had been agreed on was the market opening this morning. 
The two American candidates for the presidency who participated in the negotiations only late let themselves be seen sooner than supporter of the agreement without failing, however, to express their dissatisfaction about this that one must meet it in this extreme way. 
The democratic senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain disposals, primarily such, which shall to keep their houses make it possible for the owners and such, which concerns the salaries of the executives of the enterprises saved by the state for the agreement. 
'If one asks the taxpayers to take up extraordinary measures due to certain of the irresponsibility persons, this is nothing on which one could congratulate himself. 
But these measures are ', necessary he explained at the American TV stations. 
You asked as him on another transmitter his republican opponent answered John McCain whether he will vote for the suggested plan: 'I would like to know the details first but I hope so. 
'The basic principles which I have read [point], that this which all of us must want to digest is a thing and with which we can want to get on. 
Is not ', very simply acceptable he said to do the option, nothing at all. 
The 700 billion dollar plan is aligned with it with the money of the taxpayers 
It comes mortgage loans (Subprime) led before it expanded on broader forms verbreiteterer loans (PCAA) and the banks and financial institutions finally led a freezing the financial power and into the ruin 14 months after a crisis by the bursting of a property bubble triggered, these at first for the collapse of the venturesome. 
It was a group of republican representatives who let the first attempt fail for the agreement last week. 
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'poisonous' assets of the societies only shall be safeguarded and not bought by the government into distress, one believes himself to the dead end escaped. 
To round off the viewpoints for everyone in the convention, one also has added a disposal which means that it then can impose new taxes, if the government should make losses with this program within five years, to have its invested capital returned so. 
The new plan provides the payment of a first sum of 250 billion to which another 100 billion can be added if the president takes it for necessary. 
The payment of another 350 billion must be adopted in a renewed coordination of the convention. 
In return for its help Washington gets shares in the supported enterprises which earn it dividends in the case of profits and which can sell to it again if the storm has filed past. 
The Federal Government will have the possibility of holding back the distraint methods regarding the apartments which are bound to the property loans affected by this plan and in addition fixing deadlines for the repayment and the compensations which are paid to the executives of the enterprises concerned. 
The developers of the plan would like it, that the representative chamber coordinates already today over it, and the senate then on Wednesday. 
Despite all her efforts it isn't sure yet that her plan will get green light. 
Broader voices actually arose and the democrats against this plan both on the part of the republicans yesterday. 
Quite obviously Washington 'doesn't' understand us, explained the republican to Scott Garett, a member of the finance commission of the chamber, his voters. 
'Yes, we have a great financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But the one who consists in it doesn't ask the taxpayers ' to the register. 
The democratic representative Brad Sherman, head of a group in the convention which is called 'the Kaukus of the sceptics', represents the things differently, however, comes to the same conclusion. 
'Four hundred excellent economy professors, among this three Nobel prize winners, have written us, around us to communicate: We ask the convention be been able to not under pressure added and too superior, which way be carefully taken can ', it explained itself yesterday. 
We got the evidence once more at the same time in Europe that it is a worldwide crisis. 
During an emergency meeting the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the bank group of Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion U.S. dollars). 
The intervening of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bench BNP Paribas announced that it would do without to buy up its competitor who is in great difficulties since she has lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion U.S. dollars) through the crisis by the venturesome property loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85,000 persons and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
'The Dutch Minister of Finance explained yesterday this isn't lost money to Wouter Bos. 
In compensation we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and households value now since unsafe times are heralded. ' 
During this time the British government was about just on the other side of the Channel to nationalize another bank taken from the financial crisis to distress. 
According to the English press the government would take on all outstanding loans of this more than 41 billion (75.5 billion U.S. dollars) from property loans at the bench Bradford and Bringley. 
The Spanish bench Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the branch offices and the charge accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be to Northern skirt the second bank which must nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) -- death of a dedicated icon 
His beauty with the azure blue eyes was long time his trump, nobody would say, his weakness. 
Had the American actor escaped with the charming smile of the narcissistic mirror? 
Yes and no. 
His sensitivity, his sensibility and an obvious talent have as well well kept him away from a position of power which takes the really terrible monsters to the world. 
But what a great regular runner! 
83 years Paul Newman deceased at the results of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains this one on Friday in old age one of the last icons of the American cinema of the it golden year. 
He was more carefully less monumental in his play, at this sure also fragile, than Brando which but just the same an apostle of the liberty and the sprinkle of dramatic conventions he resembled and for which he was one kind of rival on the canvas for a long time. 
Mixed blood often yields wonderful children. 
He was born in Ohio as a son of a German Jew and a Hungarian sturdy mother in 1925. 
One of the glorious faces of the American dream should arise from its European roots. 
Without an excessive ego, utmost quality characteristic. 
The Self maggot one was in love into the fighter who was injured in the battle in the Pazifikkrieg which studied dramatic art in Yale at the beginning of the fifties and then went to the Actor's studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema, too because a whole country was mirrored again in it, this into. 
This man who fought for the civil rights was also the driver who became a second at the 24 hour racing of Mans in 1979 and in addition a sex symbol although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward in a top relation since 1958 flat. 
The unknown facets also disappear this mysterious, restrained, dedicated and opposite the glamour of the show business of oversensitive starling whose puzzles one will never solve completely with it. 
A decent man in the purest meaning of the word. 
The death Paul Newmans put the cinema enthusiasts into frenzy this weekend while all its large roles were played on the dark screen of the memories. 
More than half a century of American cinematic art in permanent change files past with it. 
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and The Sundance kid" (1969) in the memory and the young man who turns his sensory Mrs (Elizabeth Taylor) away into the cat on the hot tin roof who was filmed in 1958 of Tennessee Williams presses themselves again there. 
It a memory being behind much more briefly is, evoked (1990) the one to his sensitive Mr Bridge who is disturbed by a wedding in his high age who didn't keep all its promises. 
There was so much other Paul Newmans in the course of the history. 
Boxer Rocky Graziano announced Ther Likes Me (a handful dirt) this criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable from Somebody Up of Robert Wise, a role which was designed for James Dean, after whose death you resumed and the Newman confessed 1956 correctly. 
This pleasant crook in the outstanding The Sting (the whole point) which was honored with Oskar for the best film in 1973. 
As an embittered and vindictive billiards player in the wonderful The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
Through this face by the times, this was he. 
Still he. 
Epochs join together in his résumé. 
The youth knows him primarily from the cult movie Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an Eishockeyteams. 
His fans found him again into The Hudsucker proxy of the brothers Coen in 1994. 
With a last role 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes the circle closed. 
Unlike several cinema legends which have retired from the film world early enough Newman should stay in the saddle and betray his splendor and his concessions to Hollywood, his fortune, for a long time. 
The French writer-director Bertrand Tavernier saw it challenge not without humor to the 'Underplaying' when living when he judged his too expressive performances. 
The job wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles of a long time flew only in such a way. 
He more seldom played, however, Sunnyboys as an outsider: Neurotic, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate with a whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and his revolt. 
As a director Newman revealed unknown sides of his true delicate sensibility. 
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his Mrs Joanne Woodward in the leading role, drew a sensitive woman portrait full of melancholy. 
He his lost son Scott through an overdose, film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness, dedicated to his these 1984. 
At the high tide of honors which poured over Newman yesterday his close friend and earlier weapon companion explained Robert Redford (they had played in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and The Sundance kid) together extremely movedly: 'His presence has my life and improves this country.' 
Generosity and zest for life were major qualities of the deceased actor. 
Except for his legendary career a tall advocate of the civil rights, the environmental protection and the independent cinema comes in one opponent the leeways Hollywood, there now, too. 
We often have him well with the foot into bowls full of vinaigrette, see being in sauces, pastries or other food and for considerable tasteless held although this found us them funny still at first. 
The profits from his sales flowed nevertheless for children into need to his foundation. 
Instead of resting on his legend, Newman itself committed until the shot. 
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: 'Your father always and till completely for the end was unbelievably grateful for his good star. 
It was an honor of being allowed to be here. ' 
And for us it was an honor of being allowed to pursue the life of a so intelligent and generous American actor. 
An exemplary citizen in the narrowest and in the broadest sense.

As two of surcharge and co. has to be taken in 2003 issued invoices, the catering trade business shall have fed the ninety-headed group of the organization Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
The boss of the business says now, however, such a large group wouldn't have fitted into the restaurant suddenly. 
Another invoice have a job, exhibited in summer 2002 on the foundation?Jöv ért also showed serious form and contents faults, later than Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért, confessed. 
Being supposed to have held back themselves 130 guests as per account in a pension in Badacsonytomaj which has three rooms merely and can't house simultaneously any more than ten persons. 
No limits were apparently just sedately, as it the imagination of the invoice forgers around the Pigal Kft. Jöv went in the accounting documents of the customers ért and Hoppá according to the District Attorney on not only at all bills have a job?, a catering trade business. 
As managing director Gy?z? Informed Farkas of the hvg.hu, it was immediately clear to it that it was forged documents when documents were presented to it of the prosecuting attorney's office during an interview. 
"Our company name and the taxpayer identification code were attached wrongly on the stamp". 
And: Except for flaws the fact was also wrong that the business shall have housed one hundred persons after they have altogether eleven rooms which offer by no means so many persons place. 
The restaurant also has been led on the invoice catering, is no more into business for quite a long time. 
Verabsäumt also have to check that the Budapest travel agency taken by them into the visor exclusively offers journeys abroad and the busy invoice forgers they have said Hungary journeys on the cash payment invoice so what also contradicted to the accounting practice of the company. 
As you confessed in the course of the inquiries, furthermore they also have led the value added tax on the invoices although travel agency performances which refer to a country outside the EU are vat-exempt. 
Altogether, the amount of the value added tax was on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. Jöv have a job to the foundation?invoice issued to ért are issued by the employees exclusively machine invoices wrongly, the forged documents were, however, handwritten, in addition, since the business settles VAT instead of 25 only 15 per cent. 
The prosecuting attorney's office informed this one was another mistake which the "Rechnungslegern" had made that they had indicated in a case "goods transport" as a rendered service although this isn't offered by the company specialized in investment advice. 
Was thanks to broader flaws, wrong invoice format, wrong stamp, that these to Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány as well as to XXI. Invoices issued to Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont as fakes could be exposed. 
As well in the case of the Ravenna Bt. and the sports store Kunfehértó whose managing directors declared to have never issued the invoices. 
A different one "fault" is for the forgers at the HIB Kft. got from Nyíregyháza: At the moment, this society just was (2001) namely in dissolving when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület shall have eaten there, the mass administrator claimed consequently to have issued not the invoices. 
Consciously forged 
Persons to whom it was definitely conscious that fictitious invoices must put them are the invoice casual the other group. 
On requests of the Fiatal Baloldal -- Ifjú Szocialisták has the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány invoices for the foundation Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért, issued to 4 m. in a height of approximately hoof. 
According to the indictment the managing director became the Collab Kft. talked into the exhibition of the fictitious invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi. 
The Biogate Kft at the moment also situated in liquidation. shall have cooperated also with surcharge and co.: The GmbH shall in 2003 the foundation have a job Jöv?ért Alapítvány as well as the organizations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny? Having Egyesület provided 5 m. in the total value of hoof with forged invoices which referred to not rendered services. 
However, payment transactions admitted it make a note just as little since the invoices were immediately canceled after their exhibition what the persons affected have forgotten, however, in their documents. 
The invoice casually contains persons the third group who are immediately taken to connection with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman the Ukrainian managing director the delta Trió Kft ., an in Budapest resident, there however not traceable fuel and vehicle trade company. 
This company shall have issued several invoices to about 18 m. about the sale of EDP components in the total value of hoof in the period of October until December 2005. 
This one shall investment Kft according to the office of investigation into liquidation situated Cash since September 14th, 2005. having functioned as a buyer of these invoices from Kiskunhalas. 
Managing director of this company was a Romanian to whom the company documents also should be delivered by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has Kubatov during the inquiries confessed, invoices in the name of the GmbH. having exhibited and collected the equivalent to the organizations Atlasz and Hoppá as well as to Együtt are Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány. 
The companies Fa ban Jos Faipari Kft. as well as these Jo investment Bt. shall from Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs express have wish been founded to. 
None of these companies, however, was active in truth which was due to lacking orders according to the defendant. 
He could nevertheless profit from the enterprises: He has issued to requests of his accomplice, the advocate Zsolt Szente who was engaged to do the preparations for the company formation documents, in the name of the companies invoices to the organizations taken to connection with surcharge such as to Atlasz and Y Generáció. 
Altogether, Kubatov 15 invoices shall have issued investment and Linaxtrade for 14.2 m. in the name of the companies' cash investment, delta Trió, Fa ban Jos, Jos in the total value of hoof to the organizations. 
The prosecuting attorney's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% each of the invoice sum as well as the value added tax. 
Even the company Szi-Beri Bt shall Kubatov. having used for the exhibition of fictitious invoices, in this case the invoices were enclosed in the applications by Biztos Pont. 
Magyarországért have modernly given their applications at the charitable organization of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") to the company Y Generáció and Szövetség are in January 2006. 
Both 500,000 Forint each got, these amounts have, however, used misusedly. 
To hush this they have the TMA five fictitious invoices of the Works team Kft. presented. 
These invoices were guaranteed by the way by Árpád Kemecsei at the search of the office in the Ministry of Education. 
During the negotiations some defendants are calculating now with a confession about the procedure of the invoice fake as they were put down already in front of the prosecuting attorney's office. 
A sensation could be if the principal defendant János surcharge decides on a comprehensive confession. 
His previous details were namely less detailed and although he had accepted already repeatedly to report about everything comprehensively his confession is still due. 
So the question remains open whether this is in his interest whether this one 50 m. have into a pact entered with it regarding the compensation of the large part of the arisen damage of hoof and whether surcharge is ready in return to take on the responsibility for socialists. 
However, it is definitely possible that surcharge plays the "insulted" one now after its petitions for moderation of the detention had discovered numb ears. 
While other criminals which have caused far bigger damage and not compensated for these with economy crimes are standing on free foot or at least under detention surcharge remains this possibility refuses. 
Psychology of outbidding or why we are ready to pay more 
At auctions the buyers tend to distribute more and the offered for sale to overvalue therefore. 
Neurologists and economy researchers of the university of New York have managed to discover the neurological economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior now. 
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine the people want to act not beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and therefore are ready even to pay excessive prices. 
The researchers have tried to find out the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions. 
National lottery should play a group of the volunteers while the other one was taking part in a playful action, in the two cases the active brain regions of the experimentees were examined by means of a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
At the two games the participants could win money, one became increased activity of the Striatum, a complex below the cerebral cortex, though, measured in terms of with losers of the auction for this one an essential role plays outbidding the opponent. 
Besides many other functions this brain region is responsible "alone for" the reward of the nervous system. 
The researchers therefore thought the price increase could be explained by the avoidance of an overreaction of the Striatums. 
To support their thesis, the economists have made examinations for the backtracing of the money in addition in the researcher group. 
In this case three groups should against a partner under different conditions con-bidding. 
The control group the true value of the product was informed about, after that they have made to their uses. 
Furthermore 15 dollars became reward promised another group in case they result as winners from the game. 
The third group got 15 dollars before the auction which also were lost in the case of a lost game. 
So the difference between the two groups consisted merely that lay the emphasis unites on winning this one, lasting at the other one on losing. 
However, the members of the group playing "against losing" were ready for higher uses hypothesis expressed by neurologists as a proof for it than that one in the Kontroll or the "profit" group. 
"These results cannot be derived from any earlier economic theory. 
These have justified the behaviors watched at auctions namely only with the joy at winning or the risk avoidance till now. 
The inconsistency between these two theories was resolved thanks to the picture giving neurological methods so that we have a third explanation readily now " -- Andrew meant gravel, professor of the economy faculty of the university of New York. 
Hepatitis: When does the doctor to go? 
Around half billion people worldwide suffer under chronic hepatitis B or C, and this chronic liver disease is listed under the leading causes of death in Hungary. 
The number one hundred thousand are estimated at in this country, only seven one thousand are treated, though, what lies that the patients often don't know that they are infected the infected. 
Hepatitis is the collective name for liver diseases which are triggered by different viruses and infectious. 
The symptoms are often similar, frequent, though be different the pathogenes and the illnesses are hepatitis and jaundice from each other. 
Depending on pathogene the Hepatitisviren spread in two different ways: food or water polluted at hepatitis A and E by the digestion section (by for example) the viruses can be assigned to C and D by blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, sheath secretion or saliva) at hepatitis B. 
A vaccination becomes travelers against the viruses A and vaccine gives none C against the virus, recommended B at all events. 
The symptoms at hepatitis A show themselves about zwei-drei weeks after consumption of the polluted food and are generally accompanied by unwell condition, weakness, stomach ache and nausea. 
After that the jaundice appears on the skin and in the eyes, bright, the urine become the chair dark and the recovery can last up to zwei-drei weeks for a long time. 
Every year, about 1 m. people worldwide dies of the illnesses like cancer of the liver and hepatic cirrhosis which are triggered by hepatitis B and far more serious. 
Estimates according to only everybody are main reason for it that is tenth infected in a medicinal treatment. 
Hepatitis C also can have serious consequences: it can untreatedly lead to hepatic cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. 
Not knows even over her illness since the pathogene destroys the liver cells insidiously infected most, the first symptoms let themselves be seen in many cases after 20-30 years. 
Preventing on time such as regular control examinations is therefore imperative. 
There are three groups in which this illness happens more frequent: those which have undergone a blood transfusion in front of 1991, addicted to drugs and tattooed. 
At present, the number becomes fallen ill estimated at 200 m. worldwide this one of a chronic hepatitis C. 
Since the illness is provable already at a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to find the family doctor at the first symptoms of obscure origin. 
The illness is curable, the virus can be wiped out, the danger of infection is captivated by what and prevented to the origin of cancer, recognized on time. 
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, organized by patient representations for the first time in 2004 worldwide. 
It, the sensibility to this chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, is aim of the action to strengthen their emergence and the meaning of the early diagnosis. 
Do believers of few pains have? 
How latest research results prove that the religious faith like a way works "painkiller" which shall already have made the death of Roman Catholic martyrs easier. 
Scientists the Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: The British sheet of "telegraph" reported it was examined, how far the faith in God influences the Schmerzempfinden of man. 
In the course of the rather bizarre examination 12 believers and each atheists received electric shocks while they were studying a painting of the mother of God. 
How the results pointed, the believers could turn the large part of the pains off. 
Brain scan technology even could be proved means of one, that the Roman Catholics could activate the part of their brain which is responsible for the pain regulation. 
The examination was the first one in a research project in which philosophers and theologians of different departments of the university also take part next to scientists. 
At the test a scintillating device which handed in the electric shocks was tied for the experimentees to the left hand. 
The participants were asked to concentrate on two paintings strongly: On the one hand a picture of the mother of God painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "lady with the ermine". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin would call Maria under the believers a kind of religious trance to come out while she was since Vincis selected picture, because it was hardly different from the other painting and when calming being found. 
Spent the test subjects in a MRI scanner one half hour each and altogether 20 electric shocks got in four stages at this time while they should look at either the religious or the other painting. 
The Roman Catholics reported they would have felt at the sight of the mother of God "into safety" as if they were "looked" and they would have felt "quiet and peace". 
They have reported about 12% less pain during looking at the religious painting as if they had Leonardo's work ahead of eyes. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also took part in the test thought one also could cause similar effects with the atheists also with pictures which are other and seeming strong, one merely must find the corresponding photo. 
"We should find a picture which arouses very positive feelings such as a mother or a father", so the psychologist. 
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice the faith should change our personality and does it in many cases, too", so Wright. 
After these excellent results the question which effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or one of other comparable painter on the pain regulation of the believers had only remains. 
Would the high-quality virgin Maria achieve even better results? 
You are, about what you inform over yourself 
Google can claim with good cause on the occasion of her tenth birthday: in the bags of the people, she can be found just the same as over her heads in the sky: She knows where the people have spent her vacation to which specialists they go and what she moves. 
And thus still not enough, according to the Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google. 
In the direction of the sceptics who are bothered by Orwell's horror visions he has lined up: These would become the essential precisely the overlook web 2.0. 
Financial Times recently meant Schmidt with this, it is the primary objective of Google to collect still more personal data over the users and to come closer to the original target of the company so according to which it wants "to organize all information of this world" in an interview. 
Schmidt explained, the information is still Google after ten years world changing work only at the beginning collect. 
Asked after the status Quo within five years thought for Schmidt: he wished Google were able as "what I shall do tomorrow"?, questions ? or "really which job matches" me software programs are not able yet, though, since they wouldn't know over the users enough to answer. 
Clear that in the course of their Internet enquiries the search strings would be registered as well as also the IP-addresses not all Internet user was searched by which out and the frequented sides is about this in this. 
For example the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago permits the visitor to store its own search course and to go back to it later so that the hits can be generated later much more precisely and the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system recommends custom-made products and services due to the earlier preferences are also based on the same logic. 
The users wonder, though, what happens in the case of a data misuse, "if one has a look what I do", show some gottenly whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases it is the feelings of guilt or the fear of punishment, the striving for liberty or the on-desire against the power which at many rejection open pushes for Internet users, however, rather represented these of the company, potential power, which seems frightening and less. 
It is a proved fact that the search strings are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the cause case, though and in these law cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user. 
Recently, a prime example for this was the procedure against pedophilia in Brazil in the course of which Google presented the Brazilian government information which was collected named "Orkut" and also made an identification of the pedophilias possible of the community site. 
However, users worried for personal rights still could breathe a sigh of relief in May when EFF went to court Google together with the civil right organization successfully against the FBI: also Google cannot be in future forced therefore with any point of the constitution information to hand FBI over to it on a secret enquiry. 
The Federal Government has obtained the handing out of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search strings successfully (was, though the list of the individual users or its web and search string list withheld from it for two months retrospectively) under reference to the protection of children and young people law passed years ago, though. 
So Googles image remains controversial: Those which reluctantly return their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and private life by the use of the Google services scourge the enterprise with the indignation due to the companies appearing conservatively. 
The American "Geek culture" which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, is the next generation of the "cool businessmen" in them unlike Microsoft, this thanks to Windows market leaders, sees meanwhile even if both fight for the same aim. 
It is a possible reason for it that Google doesn't demand any identification codes from its users unlike Microsoft and provides with its services free of charge so that a source code updated more openly, permanently and program package seem than the official methods of the software giant to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler. 
On the other hand the Geeks are the problematic relationship of the personal right and this Internet getting it razor-sharp -- a relationship, this particularly within the last years thanks to the concept, has moved "web 2.0" into the center. 
Traces leave a message saying deliberately it is for web 2.0 " namely all about nothing else than around collaboration, speak, the users and the available communication channels are of use and the main thing remains the same namely even if the extents are different individually at this " to show oneself public. 
An average teenager can manage his image for services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm on several community portals -- of Facebook about Xanga this can by means of others -- with connect, and at the same time into one each other can finally backtracing system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm tie all this. Furthermore they can lead Blogs, which represent the newest photo galleries automatically which are on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of broader exemplary cases proves: When looking at the party photos of the last night the friend finds out soon with whom he her unfaithful friend has amused or the employee will dismiss himself because his annoyance over the corporate management makes only too honest in his Blog, one is certain: The concept "privacy" was interpreted completely newly meanwhile. 
Who leads an online life is what he surrenders of himself, one formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth as approximately could. 
And who tries to keep secret or to avoid even the Google monopoly a little is welcome to do this, such as with Scroogle, deliberately any traces not leaves to a tool which although accesses the search engine of Google, though. 
No few people deliberately don't on community sides register the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS-Feeds, however, also have themselves so that they aren't traceable avoided with alternative versions which are bound and therefore don't generate the best possible profile of the user either to no gigantic server parks. 
The public opinion waits spellboundly for it meanwhile until Google shows its real character. 
With its present value of USD 156 bn Microsoft the enterprise even in front of IBM (USD 140 bn), Intel (USD 124 bn) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 bn), the advertising spaces of AdWords, lies/the revenue of the advertising agencies threatens AdSense and not only this one prepares always faster to established services others software, but also developers headache. 
Critical observers also find the worrying counterpoles, though: So approximately the central management of a group has rejected a protest of the employees completely after the charges of the company nursery school were doubled, in addition, the employee meant the management, repeated catering is too costly. On the other hand, however, all this appears virtually mild, that Google in the year 2006 went even into the knees and agreed with an agreement in front of the Chinese government after which all regime critical hits or those which violate the good taste would be filtered out. 
The internal regulation of the group is, that no new service in advance is advertised but first if this is already available, too. The events of the next months and years could nevertheless turn something up strongly again: Reconciles mine, Googles book and Magazinscan or storage project accepts extents meanwhile while, that the enterprise must to itself explain court of justice with the colonel soon, others are rather worried so because of the Systems "Health" which makes the construction of a complete health profile possible using results, doctors and problems. 
Approximately "Scroogled" -- and the fact that Google builds up a genetic database already supplies to the next generation of the Sci-Fi authors with the substance, the famous novel of Cory Doctorow describes a future in the best Orwell's manner in which a man alarmingly gets approaching cash thanks to data obtained from Google. 
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd at the trace elimination 
The spokesman of the police commissioner's department informed Borsod on Tuesday the police have interrogated two teenagers now who are in the suspicion to have helped at the elimination of the traces in connection with the double murder of Ózd. 
The teenagers were confessed, at present, they are accused of financial assistance. 
According to information of the news agency MTI it is two girls who defend themselves on free foot. 
Financial assistance is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years. 
The suspicious of the double murder was taken by Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, into trial on Sunday. 
The man is under an urgent suspicion to have murdered deliberately more persons from avarice. 
In the course of the inquiries has proved that the 23-year-old had owed a 53-year a larger amount of money. 
The suspicious didn't want to settle his debts, however, he therefore lured his creditor on an area in Ózd on last Wednesday where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter. 
According to information from the MTI the man has planned the deed by a long hand, this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime. 
Together with experts the police examine the weapon used in the crime as well as the circumstances of their use now. 
A Warsaw stock exchange puts offer to buy for Prague stock exchange 
The Warsaw stock exchange has offered about 200 m. euros or 5 bn Czech crowns for the one hundred per cent purchase of the blocks of shares of the Prague stock exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw stock exchange, confirmed the supply which the Poles had put despite the fact that they were in the past excluded by the Czeches as possible owners of their stock exchange. 
It is reason for it that the Warsaw stock exchange belongs to the state completely. 
99% of the shares are, in the hands of the Polish state this one wants to sell more than 60% of the papers within the next months, though. 
After entries of the Czech daily "E15" the offer of the Poles contains the so far highest selling price which was ever offered for the Prague stock exchange. 
As reports the newspaper, up till now the Viennese stock exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York stock exchange, the London stock exchange and the German stock exchange have put offers. 
Petr Koblic, boss of the Prague stock exchange said last week that the Warsaw stock exchange probably would be the worst new owner from all the interested parties and he didn't rule out either that, in future, this even could lead to the shutdown of the Prague stock exchange. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 bn crowns. 
According to the agreements of the shareholders 90% of the shares could be sold. 
The tallest owner of the Prague stock exchange is, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the tiger the Patria Finance investment Bank holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent with a 25 per cent participation. 
The financial crisis from the view of European newspapers 
In their comments dedicated to the international financial crisis getting critical always further some leading European sheets spoke already of "September second 11th" on Tuesday. 
"La Repubblica" thought approximately we have for the global finance catastrophe to thank the American president -- the president who should take alleviation to the alarming situation a little hasn't been able to unite his own party for the law outline behind himself once ... 
As the investor worth a few billion, Warren Buffett, called it it would be one "new Pearl Harbor" more appropriately, of "September second 11th" to speak instead of. 
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate to the scapegoat in Washington. 
In opinion of the "El Mundo" the missing political leadership is to blame for the world economy being now on the edge of the collapse. 
The American financial system threatens always more to cave in and under this the whole world will suffer. 
Bushs plan wasn't perfect, the danger that no political means has the crisis management for Washington to readily threatens after the coordination in the convention now, however. 
The world economy hangs in the air and to be more precise precisely at a time since one of the greatest transformations of the history of the capitalism takes place. 
Approximately the Genevan "day indicator" thinks one cannot disregard the threat any more. 
Some states still could provide their financial institutions got into swaying with rescue packages and save the banks from the bankruptcy with the money of the taxpayers although. 
A domino effect is triggered, though and still more banks go it broke, neither further cash injections nor other immediate measures then help. 
In the long run the EU member states should jump over their shadow and centralize control over the money markets. 
Alone on Monday more than EUR 100 bn were paid out to weak financial institutions, the Viennese "the standard" reminds. The doubts are in addition, so far, still more realistic that the newspaper must grip the European taxpayers into their bags after the Americans also a little more deeply now to get out of the crisis. 
Till now, the EU hasn't seriously had a good look at the crisis which sweeps like a tsunami over the old continents now. 
The "rescuers" wouldn't immediately have "to wave" several hundred billion euros, however, it would be held tight advisably, in which case it would be sensible to grasp the money of the taxpayers to turn an even bigger damage away. 
An intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumble-bee 
What would be the best method for the development of new technologies to the accident avoidance, to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature if not? 
For example that one of the bees. 
An astonishing project at which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumble-bees of systems avoiding accident more newly at the creation was introduced at the CEATEC in Japan. 
Nissan has equipped the biol mimetic system, a mini-car, steered by car robots of the type BR23C built in cooperation with the Tokyo university with the qualities of the bees to support the development of a system with the aim which avoids any collisions. 
Every bee forms its own, oval "private area" in the flight which is very similar to our own "shield", Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and development of the research, said at the exhibition. 
The combined eye of the bee which can see in every direction and in an angle of over 300 degrees plays an important role in this. 
To imitate the function of the combined eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser controlled distance knife. 
This identifies obstacles in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters in front of the BR23C, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor to board which immediately starts the collision avoiding process. 
The obstacle is registered in split seconds and the car robot immediately changes the course like the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the corresponding angle. 
Unlike previous systems this maneuver takes place purely instinctively. 
"If it weren't that way, the car robot couldn't react fast enough to evade the obstacles", explained Toshiyuki Andoh, leader of the "Mobility Laboratory" and the car robot project. 
The system must a layer within which accidents are at present still valid as inevitable react instinctively and immediately since this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield. 
The complete process must reflect the behavior of the bees if they make way for other bees. 
And this must go off in the fraction of a second. 
The alternative solution cannot be diagonally carried out up, down or even unlike the bees, though, it only can be two-dimensional and but only in the direction of the Wendbarkeit of the tires. 
While many possibilities are open to the bees here infinitely to make way for other bees, the researchers could make use of only the rotation or and of accelerating of braking at the car robot. 
The BR23C contains lithium Polymerbatterien which are easier and more energy efficient and therefore have a longer life time lithium ion batteries when conventional. 
Andoh explained it depends on the instinctive, intelligent reaction and less on the processing of the data and still less on the ability to save these. 
This device must process merely some inputs and react to them correspondingly per second. 
This must not store or produce an intuitive, logical reaction using earlier maneuvers so that, constantly, it merely takes Memory a handful kb. 
It doesn't require any gigabyte and megabyte heavy Memories. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology which will be standard in production in assessment of Nissan within the next ten years. 
Further application could find the technology at the GPS satellite navigation by managing the driver around obstacles consciously and leading him to the aim so. 
A name for the wickedly expensive child 
The written version of the 700 bn dollar difficult rescue package law which will have to be used in several stages and aims at the purchase of the bad loans of the banks is available now. 
Half of the money shall be distributed in the first gateway. 
This one reported East coast came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time, the convention representatives have made their way to an agreement about the 700 billion dollar heavy rescue package after several days of debates to Reuters in a meeting. 
Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the American parliament, said "we have obtained essential progress", and thought one must only bring about the agreement to paper. 
Both candidates for the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the reached compromise on the rescue package. 
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson thought about the result: The program will show effect and it gets efficient, however, one still must do more. It wouldn't be all about the rescue of Wall Street here according to the Pelosi but around this, the oar of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written setting of the package was still published that is Washingtonly the time Sunday evening 8 o'clock (Central European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning) before the opening of the Asian markets, however, hasn't triggered any high-altitude flight at the stock exchanges. 
On Monday the parliament votes on the law outline for the stabilization of the economy of 2008 first, then it is the senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on the Saturday evening and the White House also welcomed the messages about the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the progress obtained in the night and the efforts of both appreciate parties, our markets stabilize and protect our economy, Tony Fratto, spokesman of the White House, said. 
The program differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, though, according to which the 700 bn dollars should be spent on the purchase of securities which are bad and charged by loans suddenly. 
Half of the 700 billion amount shall at most be distributed in a first tranche in which 250 bn are immediately available after the convention will as expected vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum shall be spent for the purchase of credit loaded, bad securities and more than the further 100 bn USD the president shall decide. 
The program is, checked by a commission of its own this one also the president of the Federal reserve belongs. 
Other half of the 700 bn depends on another decision of the convention. 
According to the law the Treasury also can use composite tactics: It can purchase bad loans, mortgages, and securities charged by mortgages simultaneously or loans also other "poisonous." 
The purchase reported how responsible persons of the department, can be carried out both in an auction and directly. 
The law makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program at which the Treasury guarantees the alarming means and the enterprises pay corresponding charges to the damages to be expected. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means so that can be provided up to 700 bn dollars as an emergency aid for the American financial system, is for the large-scale purchase of bad means, her insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk which is triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution it. 
We set Paulson the necessary steps so so that we are ready for introduction of the law as soon as it was signed. 
The bosses of the banks got into difficulties and instructed on state help now can expect, though, that their clearances which sloppily are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang are shortened by the government. 
A cut in the salaries will give it only in certain cases and these cuts will depend on it like the Treasury respectively helps out. 
The cut means essentially that if purchases the department in the context of an auction, "Golden Handshake" is taxed so unless the clapped-out bank boss is deported in the pension. 
In the case of a direct purchase of the bad loans the government will switch itself on aggressively to make sure that the manager salaries aren't exaggerated. 
Is also proper to the picture, that existing Golden Handshake-Verträge isn't changed, the restrictions refer only to new agreements so that all the more people take part in the program. 
This is the first the democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure, commented on case in the American history that cuts are regulated at manager salaries by law. 
The state wins participation rights at the participating banks so that the risk sinks for the taxpayers since they also can participate as soon as the economy and thus also the bank saved feel better again. 
The law outline provides that the president must present a suggestion to the convention within the next five years how the taxpayers shall get their lost money back from the finance sector again. 
There were sceptics on the two sides who have expressed their doubts with respect to the plan, though. 
This which protects plan isn't what ours American citizens expect the money of the taxpayers under no circumstances, so the Californian republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur meant: The measures which are responsible also for the collapse to Wall Street were advanced by the same persons.

Press review of the German-speaking room 
The right store is intact, only the voters got more self-confident within the store, "the mirror" comments on the weak performance of CSU in Bavaria so. 
In Austria Haider and co. are ready for it rule to prevent a red black coalition. 
The mirror (spiegel.de) 
In the online issue of the German news magazine established on the left Franz Walter analyzes the reasons of the dramatic defeat of CSU in his article "Bavaria's revolution eradicates its fathers". 
In opinion of the renowned political scientist the erosion of CSU already started before for a long time the sad Beckstein-Huber duo assumed its offices. 
The Christian Socials have replaced Bavaria over decades, the modern citizens are just turning away from them now. 
The epoch break is a problem of the Christdemokratie, as also for Angela Merkel, at the same time. 
The disaster of CSU quite as a surprise didn't come but on Sunday what already stood out rather exactly ten years ago, though has come to an end a little: the undoubted hegemony of an official party 
Ten years ago 1998 then already CSU lands at 47.7 per cent and fell thus for the first time for the fifties under the fifty per cent brand 
This recurred at the parliamentary elections in 2005 three years ago that is still in the much quoted Stoiber era. 
The modernization operated by CSU in the federal state consistently has in the end eradicated its own mothers and fathers. 
Sociologists had forecast this already 40 years ago, however, miscalculated it in the speed considerably. But couldn't remain the secularization, the education successes, the draw without consequences from east and North German to the prospering regions of Bavaria on the faithfulness of the CSU voters. 
Modernization is always accompanied by Options increase. And this has political consequences. 
The right store is intact, only the voters within the store got more critical and more self-willed. 
It is striking that within the last weeks the classic citizen groups said the biggest distance virtually to CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voter with abitur like degree. 
The support of CSU sank on even under 40 per cent here. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
Does the conservative Viennese daily report whom " with whom in hers? Articles on the chaotic domestic situation entitled holding party leaders back in coalition questions " after the new elections in Austria. 
The SPÖ would like to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP forbids itself the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ shows itself open to conversations in all directions while the Greens don't want to commit themselves with respect to a coalition yet. 
The new elections are past and everything is turning now around the coalition; in the debates on television under public law the party leaders had hardly looked in their cards. 
SPÖ boss Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to want to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation of both parties is very probably possible, this is already the case in some federal states and in the social partnership. 
The question whether it could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the present ÖVP boss as a vice-chancellor, then left Faymann open. 
As he said, the voters would have voted the bowl Molterer course out. 
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question. 
Molterer has reacted to red offers carefully meanwhile. 
He thought the cooperation cannot go fertile if Faymann tries to interfere in internal requests of the ÖVP. 
At present, whether its party goes into opposition or in the coalition is completely open and these questions should be discussed ÖVP internally. 
BZÖ boss Jörg Haider showed himself straight in all directions. 
So Haider is " we to take on ready, government responsibility ", to prevent around red black. 
Járóka: The vicious circle of the poverty and the segregation must be broken through 
The European peak which this year is organized by the EU Council presidency country France has started to the equal opportunities in Paris today. 
In their talk addressed to the plenum made Lívia Járóka, Fidesz representatives to the European people's party, this awarely particularly of the education segregation is the biggest obstacle, in addition, since this is one of the most serious on the right injuries which happens to Romany children, for the drive for personal prestige. 
The high-profile meeting was opened up by the French occupation and Minister of Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand in the name of the French advice presidency and Vladimir Spidla, EU inspector for occupation, social matters and equal opportunities. 
Representatives of governments, the European management and employees, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizen organizations were under the participants from the area of equal opportunities. 
How the press office of the EP representatives reports to the Fidesz, Járóka has drawn one's attention that the job search, the Romanies would at besides discrimination be primarily replaced because of their low standard of education of the labor market. 
"No middle school education has the vast majority of the Romany teenagers and thanks to a bad elementary school education only a small portion of them can reach a degree". 
Járóka emphasized that education is a basic human right which a pivotal role would befit at the Geltendmachung of other human rights Weiters. 
The economy of the EU member states can strengthen investments into the early education of Romany children. 
In opinion of the representative it is important that a circle as broad as possible, that is Romanies and not Romanies, becomes conscious of these connections. 
Because the earlier one Roma Schüler starts with the school, all the more strongly his chances to become the productive member of the labor market increase; and by income and sales tax they make their contribution to the national expenditure. 
As union citizens so Lívia Járóka must the right to high-quality education be secured for the Romanies " -- the bad and blessing ruled over lesson must be stopped ". 
As the representative explained, an action of the European Union which is concerted, am aimed and action oriented is necessary to accelerate the process of desegregation on the education sector. To this the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti discrimination directives is imperative. 
We must break through the vicious circle from poverty, segregation and unemployment "and" the democratic give Romany children possibilities of contributing to the future of Europe as citizens with full rights, Járóka demanded. 
Since the convention in Berlin last year the peak is organized every year with the aim, a unique forum for the pre-attachment of the aims of the equal opportunities and discrimination liberty at a European but also national level of making according to the "European year of the equal opportunities". 
CSU: Mercy for a limited time 
You decide about the destiny of the pleased duo Huber-Beckstein at the end of October 
No heads roll despite the choice debacle in the meantime yet, the staff debates were adjourned at the head of Bavarian CSU. 
Party leader Erwin Huber and governor Beckstein still stay in their offices, the question only is how long this mercy lasts. 
The destiny of the tandem after the disastrous 17 per cent voting loss is decided on at the extraordinary party convention at the last October weekend. 
However, the duo scolded much had already been getting it, that it wouldn't like to stick on her armchairs. 
They want to calm down the annoyed parliamentary group and the grass-roots which demanded personal consequences after the "Bavarian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority a day with that. 
The Christian social union still reached 60.7 per cent five years ago, admitted under the leadership of the Edmund Stoiber being at his career highlight. It could secure only 43.4 per cent of the voices now though, a year after the revolt against Stoiber. 
For 46 years, CSU was "Alleinregierer" in Bavaria which gains 18 per cent of the German GDP. 
The conservatives remain the defining strength in the southern federal state also important to the Hungarian economy, however, will have to rule in a coalition in future. 
As the first sign of the internal party restructurings the potential successor Hubers, vice-president and federal agrarian secretary Horst Seehofer also is tied into the reconnaissance team which helps "free voter" orientated towards the right exploratory talks over a possible Munich coalition with a liberal FDP or this one. 
It comes an irony of destiny at once around then that the determined politician that Gabriele Pauli gets in to the legislation with the list "free voters", the anti Stoiber's appearance the Huber-Beckstein has made use of duo first merciless abzuservieren. 
The CSU leadership concentrates all its strengths on the stabilization Becksteins now. 
In this transition process an active role will befit Stoiber who pulled the threads out of the background till now. The former governor and CSU chairman called September 28th this one "bitterest day of his political career". 
On Monday Huber made a couple of poisonous remarks in the direction of CDU -- in his opinion CSU would have earned far more support of the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel. 
If CSU which has contributed much to the success also at a national level in 2005 should be put not again with a common show of strength on the legs, Merkel cannot become a chancellor after the parliamentary elections again in September 2009. 
Merkel who hasn't made any secret out of her disappointment about the fiasco thinks that the land loss of CSU won't have an effect on the large coalition in Berlin negatively. 
What is relative, though? Wounded CSU won't more easily have to be ruled and the crisis of the social democrats goes on meanwhile. 
With 18.6 per cent SPD obtained its till now best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukaschenko opposition: 110-0 
In the elections on Sunday it has taken nones of representatives of the opposition to the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers think this is due to the prosperity and stability in the country commanded by Alexander Lukaschenko, the OECD suspects law adversities at the counting of the voices, though. 
The OECD which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries hasn't respected the elections. 
Although De legislation of the 10 million inhabitant state has got by without opposition for decades. This one has nevertheless seriously hoped for the other side assembled under the name "united democratic strengths" (ODS) before yesterday's elections that Lukaschenko which replaced its presidency mandate in the dirty elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 already for the fourth time would allow "some representative of the opposition" in the parliament this time. 
Therefore the ODS has taken distance even of the boycotts planned before. 
The Ukraine gets economically still dependent on Russia thanks to the increasing prices at the natural gas import. Even loans were raised for the alleviation of the price increases and the country also has agreed to the disposal of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline running through the country, to the Russians. So the hope was in the background of the expectations of the opposition, the Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukaschenko and other high-profile politicians have refusal of entry because of the political system classified as antidemocratic in the EU. 
The evaluation report of the elections of the OECD provided a temporary diversion, in which, instead of movements the emphasis rather on the positive one lay on the defects, such as the end shutdown of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections. 
The fast report of the OECD criticized the campaign -- already on Monday, though, therefore opposition might not happen in the press -- and particularly the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present at the counting of the voices. 
The opposition is able for a recovery recognize despite alledem in the political system: Political prisoners were put on free foot approximately and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by furthermore refusing south Ossetia and Abkhazia the appreciation of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces although Russia with which the Ukraine on the paper forms a federal state has regarded the two areas as independent for a month. 
"We have two steps forward and unite made backward, it is, however, the most important that the dialog has started between White Russia and the EU", said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our sheet. 
In opinion of the opposition candidate of the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable although have letting only an opposition one also to the parliament "fear got the powerful ones". 
The opposition doesn't plan any protest measures in view of the results but rather tries to make the necessity of an economic reform clear to the voters. 
We have to contend with many problems " -- the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way at the sales stones but I nevertheless see that more and more people support the change, even the old person " -- told Milinkewitsch in allusion to it here that not even the most supported layer of the Pensionisten approves of the Lukaschenko regime whose only income is the production of a social safety. 
Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit merely one "is" question of time until the "social safety" bringing to mind the silence of a cemetery starts to crumble, so Milinkewitsch. 
Russian observers have described the elections as democratic unlike the opposition politician. 
Sergej Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States explained Ria Novosti to the news agency: "The people believe the deeds and not the words". The being absent of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belorussian voters. 
Brunetta: "As of now you have breakfast before the work" 
There are rotatable doors for the one and exits of the officials for the first time in the history the Palazzo Chigi. 
As of today the measure becomes those clever-dicks become effective, first postmark and then go during the working time Kaffeetrinken this one against this one. 
Anti lazybones law was introduced by Renato Brunetta, the secretary for public administration and of Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the committee of the ministerial committee the new?" today. 
">, "rotatable doors are a means for the increase of the work efficiency by a higher presence quota and more services", so secretary Brunetta. 
"A new era of the responsibility and transparency starts now. 
This is ", reformism Brunetta underlines once again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi the appointment ends in all buildings of the committee of the ministerial committee. 
Masi thinks about it: the choice is also worth the rotatable doors " of great symbolic value ". 
On the part of the officials there was no resistance, the Secretary General insured: "This process was supported by everyone, the cooperation came from all sides". 
So there all in all is no more breakfast during the working time now; End with Kaffe or croissant. 
Brunettas guesses regarding this with a smile: "A good cappuccino works wonders at 7 o'clock". 
During a conference of the upper trash of the public administration (Scuola Superiore Della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
of Rome the secretary announces that themselves "have reduced the Abwesenheiten of the officials to 50% within three months, this means 60,000 persons per annum more are present at work". 
He adds, it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy 
"the pay dynamics was last 8-10 years twice as in size the secretary just like the private area and far above the rate of inflation into this one". 
The Brunetta decree in the context of the vocation entgegenzuarbeiten supported by Codacons has combined forces thousands of officials, around in the meantime. 
"While the secretary for the public service is making a name for himself with numbers about lower Absenzen at work, the consumer advice center writes -- the people of the 'active lazybones' grows incessantly so. 
Thousands correct and worthy officials of the public service have indeed combined forces to declare the war on the unlawful norms of the decree." 
Additional financial compensations particularly are fought for for a work conditional illness in front of the regional Administrative Court (TAR); so become the planned expansion of the obliging detention of the ill worker recipient also, during which one control visits can be made and far aspects of the innovations of the secretary contested. 
Napolitano: "Prevention of work accidents is decisive" 
Every day 2500 work accidents happen in Italy, three persons die and invalids have 27 left for life. 
For the year 2007 the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm namely that the fatal work accidents were around 1200. 
These numbers cover the seriousness of a phenomenon, which causes almost twice as many deaths than by murders arise. 
Today will do the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi Del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy for the victims of work accidents the 58th national day to steer the attention of the social institutions and media on this dramatic situation so. 
"The data which are alarming and spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how decisive the question of the prevention is at work."the president of the republic of Giorgio Napolitano confirms the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati Ed invalidi Del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli, in his communication to the president. 
The leader expresses his "great esteem for the constant engagement to the prevention at works to the protection of the injured workers, to financial assistance for the families of the victims and to the sensitization of the public opinion". 
""Basta" has risen on this an outraged; understandable at tragedies which trigger some whirl for the public in the media and sympathy, measured in terms of their order of magnitude. But the everyday reality frequently confronts us with dramatic events which even can recur in their momentum ". 
Napolitano doesn't hide that in any case there also is a resource problem ": it must decisively be invested in education and information." 
These accept numerous initiatives a special meaning, these himself for a more direct Bewusstwerdung into school frameworks on the part of the teenagers nurse the working world. 
It is our duty to turn towards this phenomenon and not to turn away of his social seriousness the attention. One must put and improve a legislative norm in operation. 
The president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini has "to aim" at decided rules which have the aim of setting the problem an end emphatically as the phenomenon of the work conditional deaths forms an urgent social emergency which offends the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions for his part. 
"The data of the work accidents" seem to signal a slight improvement, this, however, doesn't rule out that the number of the work conditional deaths is far too high, emphasizes president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We wouldn't like that this "positive trend" means less attention. Exactly this causes the tragedy at the end." 
"How think that one does too little in reason to counter the phenomenon of the accidents? One can fight against it by different actions. 
Stronger controls and inspections are necessary in our opinion? so Mercandelli; " but stronger measures for the clearing up of the workers who already start in school also. 
"Another effort is he necessarily -- so adds -- what the communication and the sensitization of the public opinion tackles. 
A grösseres sense of responsibility which represents a social emergency but primarily is " in demand on the part of the employers compared with a phenomenon. 
Mercandelli also spoke abolition of the social system about "the progressive deterioration of the protection for the work casualties" and this one denounced " at, we within the last few years fight which ones ". 
"It is consequently the aim to give the worker recipient a guarantee back on insurance so that the destiny of the victim of a work accident doesn't get dependent on voluntary or coincidental donations which are decided by a legislator at the moment of time". 
Mp3 player under charges: Danger of hearing damages 
Can lead to permanent hearing damages to hear loud music with portable music equipments, like e.g. Mp3 player, over a longer period of time. 
This reports the European Commission which quotes the EU the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee about the current one and health risks recently identified) in a report distributed in Brussels today. 
"From the report? it is called that way in a remark? 5-10 % get, clear that the ones who listen to loud music with portable music equipments, risk the durable loss of their hearing for at least five years weekly longer than an hour on the day ". 
I worry so Meglena Kuneva without knowing it irretrievably damage such a large number of teenagers who put normally portable music equipment and mobile telephones on a high volume, their hearing, ", that ". 
"From the scientific results? it is called that way on the part of the Eu? a clear risk which is pressing to a fast behavior lets itself be seen. 
What really counts, it is to sensitize the consumers and to make this information about common property. 
We must check the control systems already existing in view of this scientific knowledge again so that they are completely effective and hold step with the new technology ". 
Brussels had engaged the independent scientific committee in view of the common use of the portable music equipments under teenagers. 
The communication of the EU excludes " the scientists -- - confirm that one is got rightly and that the Eu commission will examine the necessary measures together with the other Eu members and the things concerned now to be able to protect children and teenagers better from the noise which comes from portable music equipments and similar equipment " so. 
A European norm which limits the standard of the noise of portable music equipments on 100 dB already exists at the moment. The anxiety about the damages which could come from a too large noise load. 
One can delimit these damages very much, in which one reaches for solutions like the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise abandonment. 
In its report the scientific committee shows the Eu, that at this these are regarded, if the users of portable music equipments listen to loud (loud than 89 decibels) music only five hours the week, regarding the maximum noise level at the job so that the legal limits are already exceeded. 
Those, the music exceed this limit risk the complete loss of the hearing within of five years. 
So this would concern 5-10 % of the users of such equipment whose number can open be valued between 2.5 and 10 million persons in the Eu. 
The signal for the "commission for the future of the capital" gives Romanies, Alemanno 
We begin today, it shall be past, balance sheets are struck in June in March. 
This is the expiry fixed by the capitol for the work of the "commission for the future of the capital Rome". The commission has met in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal springs this morning. 
Within six months the president Marzano and the further 49 members of the commission will work out the leadership lines for Rome. 
As soon as the project will be completed, the town and the district council will judge the analyses and projects to be able in June to be able to introduce the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the capitol and the mayor's Gianni Alemanno provided. 
The commission is absolutely independent "and" all political, social and cultural opinions are represented on it -- Alemanno emphasizes. "It will this one offer suggestions on a development plan for Rome, persons responsible of the town and the district council politically stay. 
No repartition of responsibilities, only the will to have a place at which one can develop a great project for Rome, exists. 
In March its task will be ended and one the commission will dissolve again since such a project must have a from the point of view of time certain end-point. 
We will the mayor introduce the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the commission announced in June so -- ". 
Who the competence of the commission does question Alemanno since the opinion lacks to liability, replied this? "Everything depends on the work which will do the commission and of the quality of its suggestions. 
She provides the Attali commission, qualityfull results if, like in France? and this will be the case in Rome surely? its contribution then will be fundamental. 
The politics too often deals with the everyday problems and emergencies which appear from time to time. 
On the other hand, we want to have a longer time period in the look, around in a deeper perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the town seriously work " so. 
The mayor of Rome attaches much importance to it, " to render the following more precisely this commission is worth neither useless facilities nor a wreck: it is absolutely cost-free, it won't cost the Roman citizens any cent and it will make us think. It will employ the best minds of the capital ". 
It is necessary to have a strategic plan which is neither hermetic nor static sound Alemanno ours unite town " around -- it really needs this one -- to make it possible, and take such a common step in the future quality jump ". 
Which will not confine oneself only in the current municipal limits but look much further a future, so the mayor of Rome, not only with regard to the role of Rome as metropolis and political capital of Italy but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean." 
Obama? the first anti American president? Here an explanation 
A well-known American politician has much lies but to be looked at independently written, this: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti American president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, this one by his decisions which decimated economy of the USA and which cultivated relations with the befeindeten Islam (and does this as a private individual certainly today), ". 
The attacks against Obama are getting still more intense, straight now where the elections approach. 
A lady from Miami has written in an Internet page: "This person is full of ambitions. 
Obama is very impudent: he thinks he will get the highest office of a nation which has seen altogether two black governors and five black senators!". 
Actually these attacks don't have to say a lot, however; it is racialist attacks and they don't answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the surveys, too; everyone says that Obama with a great lead will win. 
Also in this case there are people who speak with the heart and not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi in the deepest south of the United States has written in hers in the editorial: we will know only in the polling booth well whom the real American patriot will give his voice. 
Here a mentality of the USA appears, up to this one was held in secret lastly. 
"Say we will then decide what you want, for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether for Obama or for Mccain". 
It is people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America. 
What one a little never heard before? the success so surely seems the black candidate only now where. 
In all cases despite all these considerations the definite weapon for the democrats is George Bush. 
1500 persons were questioned: Which faults has Bush made during his period of office? 89% have answered: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick into the bottom again. 
In Iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their life and the Americans weren't forced to pack. 
Iraq nevertheless remains the weak point of Bush for the majority. 
The one who will take his job stands before a gigantic task. 
The USA. The financial collapse leaves its traces also with journalists: One can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press. 
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW research center about their situation and their mental control concerning the future. 
Today is what pessimistically concerns almost all journalists her future. 
They nevertheless didn't explain this one to responsible concerning the information really gottenly because of the general reliability opposite. 
You don't feel as alone as early. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model which was destroyed for these journalists. 
The great problems come added to that the Newsroom meeting cuts, that is the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper there. 
It is a problem which must be solved? interviewed these journalists so? if one wants to prevent that the traditional journalism doesn't shrink fundamentally as the large audience understands him. 
A clear but complicated pessimism fulfills the American journalist today. 
Six of ten journalists and Executive senior of the printing press are of the opinion that the journalism is national on standard on the wrong way. 
It is in the local area with the Executives even about 65%. 
Printed vs. broadcast. 
It isn't difficult for the journalists to imagine in which direction the web goes. 
The most important publishing house groups force the way to the Internet which is seen in the printing press by many as the "killer". 
The "economic pressure" which the journalists feel has increased by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted in the hope to want to follow the new technology "it takes something good for the journalism". 
Today, the greatest rip consists in the American journalism between the editor-in-chiefs of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them. 
56% of the editor-in-chiefs are sure, their reporters share their values with them on national standard while it is merely 23% at a local level. 
Some think it has with the "certainty in the work" to work. 
The works managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at a national level. 
With the journalists it is 30%. 
The topic of the "safe work" in the team talk (.) . "our editors, note" this a current theme always is in the USA. 
Only 13% of the journalists work under contract. 
They wish and it becomes a question of take it or leave it so in a gigantic nation as these are the USA with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers offer the employers like it to magazines, radio and TV transmitters and Internet operators. 
The editor-in-chiefs very often get very high pay, pensions and insurance monies the editor however can get only 10000 euros per month occasionally to it. 
The thing concerns what the vacation, gets complicated so: crowd determined in the first year, so and so many after the third one on days to finally after a certain number of years reach 15 holidays a. 
But the American journalists frequently will in the course of the year "illy" as they themselves admit. 
It is a question of the climate. 
University pole: Court in the ROM: IN GROTTAFERRATA has DANILO COPPOLA left 
The president of the second division for criminal matters of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to turn down the application of the realtor. This had asked to be transferred by Grottaferrata to Rome. 
It becomes against Coppola because of bank red in the context of the investigation on the counter-agreement in the case of the take-over of university pole Bnl. investigate. 
In the course of the process against it during this one week lusts, its dismissal was changed into a stay duty from the detention in Grottaferrata. 
His advocates Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to permit the realtor to be transferred by the provincial town into an apartment in the capital. 
According to the court could derlei transfers against which ones (had the prosecuting attorney's office voiced) gives it the possibility of influencing its society and reaching body of evidence accusing him. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had revealed itself already some days ago when the representative chamber voted against the 700 billion dollar economy package of the White House: A tall portion of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street but to save the economy one. 
This confirms yesterday's version to the New York Times which reports how the crisis divides the republican party in the trot always more splits in its old and moderate East Coast soul, always and which business community favored this one the state institutions and that neon conservative, the and "these in Washington" the financial world hostilely contrasts and V . . are this one wins in the south and the center of the states of voter. 
This part of the party owes its advancement to V . are . the voice the one whom I mentioned above. 
This example just mentioned is only a small portion of the great changes meanwhile which the short-term economic earthquake announces or even already represents: wanting to be affected by these also beyond this in the complete west and perhaps not only in the USA. 
The crisis seems both in the states and in Europe to accelerate the events feared for a long time which take shape under these new conditions and come to the light. 
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the outrageous renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy. 
The crisis indeed means a decline of the bank and finance institutions which close connections to the foreign countries have and an enormous set of the fortunes of private households which live in one single state manages at the same time. 
This means an immediate political problem for the governments: one enormous voter mass yes also representing which ones namely as it is necessary to behave opposite the families concerned. 
So the crisis seems economically global, it is almost purely nationally political against this. 
The political internationalism seems to have advised to be and lost its talk right to himself so to the offside: The plausible evidence for it has been given by the EU which doesn't know how to find any common way due to its division in different national and international conflicts. 
Everyone therefore expects the intervention of the state of one's own now; Rescue plans, new rules and V . are . distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis got graver and graver, merely the USA are an economic situation in it to save himself without strange help. 
And furthermore they also have the identification besides the means to employ these: therefore two to not about judging prerequisites? otherwise to which ones will under certain circumstances?, be able no international organization and no market go back in a similar way well? 
That new stress which is put on the state national element is in a perfect harmony as for the rest with the bigger and bigger importance which is taken to connection recently with a sector put into the narrowest in the economy: the territoriality. 
More paradoxically it is way to have already just now when we were so convinced of it anyway entered a networked entire empire, to an empire of the always subtly differentiated technologies, the immaterial one that, suddenly, we must how our future will always depend on the essentially material things more anyway notice: Waters, harvest and oil. 
All these can be transported by a place to the different one of the world certainly, however, are connected nevertheless on outermost piece paraphrased narrowly with one earth? a territory. 
The one who has such a territory therefore is, a different one, opposite, which lives in a harvest unproductive, waterless or free of oil deposits area in the advantage. 
I come now to the second novelty which, however, presupposes a short slide-in unit. 
Government thus also tells Leadership who says politics whom territory, whom. 
In this sense seems the financial crisis to cause two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand is there knowing respected Leaderships around the necessity therefore the need for somebody who knows how one regulates the things. 
A wave of the indignation at the existing leaderships, V exists are on the other side . . now those the economy which have turned out to be insufficient and full of shade zones. 
Aspect sufficing more deeply a and worrying still in certain meaning finally joins: A confidence loss, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of the distance which all of them focuses on a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It seems so the conviction under large portions of the population to itself to clear the way that it isn't first the deeds of the social elite but already its idea world, her Way of Life, its culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary appears to be more foreign to the majority as always and come. 
So the demand for Leadership nurses underground a branched but powerful movement of the deprivation of power of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden reversal of the collective frame of mind of the last time: starting (and) perhaps the victory of the rightists also plays a role here in Italy with the advancement of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria about the collapse of the Labour party in Great Britain to for the rebellion of the American representative against Bush. 
One gains the impression when is this one has an old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectuals creditor, some still would say its format more and more, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding this one, nowadays which goes in the lower social layers of the west in front of himself and of the financial crisis the Überdimensionalität and up to driven. 
It would have time face all this one simply exaggeratedly, of a rebellion "of the masses." 
Meanwhile, however, it for certain isn't to keep the eyes wide open. 
This one rounds up the super adhesive, to walls 
The strengths to defeat the gravity thanks to an adhesive and walls hochklettern to be able to do like Superman. 
This is the object of four American research centers of which one has apparently arrived almost at the aim now. 
The researchers have managed with an adhesive found on an area of only 2.5 sq cm to fix a 100 kg heavy body on a vertical wall. 
The studio? an American magazine the Georgia institutes has, has the results of the researchers of the university of Dayton, Akron, of Technology and the Air Force research Laboratory published. 
The material invented by the researcher team is which one carbon little nanotube a further development of the adhesives already used, called, use a special carbon structure. 
One can " the principle of the adhesive " imagine spaghetti of arranged tubes like a row to a stack, of Technology in Atlanta Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia institute itself explains. 
The scientists have themselves of the can be inspired feet of the geckos which are covered by microscopic little Hares who give the animal a perfect support. 
The tests carried out with different materials like glass of teflon and abrasive paper have so Liming Dai, researcher of the faculty for engineering sciences of the university of Dayton, "has removed without problems from the wall" shown as the hold ability of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time that the new adhesive is stronger ten times. 
To walls ENTLANGWANDERN? This material could be used as transitory adhesive " ", Liming Dai adds. 
Approximately around as Spiderman on walls emporzugehen? Perhaps spare but the researchers rather think of a less fascinating use, such as the connection of electrical equipment, because the little nanotubes are as well leaders of warmth and electricity. 
Wider application areas could fall to the area of the space-travel. 
For the moment, so the super heroes still must wait. 
The other manner of the research? the university of Berkeley, California, also devotes itself to a new adhesive type. 
In an article of the American Chemical Society the Californian scientists present an adhesive these clean themselves like hair by movement on a surface from the dust and through this maintain always a perfect liability of micro fibers. 
Drug: never taking with fruit juice 
Caution with grapefruit, oranges and apple juice. 
Are is consumed in summer these drinks, quality refreshing which ones due to them and their vitamin wealth V, it can cause serious health damages if they are taken at the same time with a certain essential medicine . since this can have an effect on the photo by the body in an extreme way. 
David Bailey, professor the University of western Ontario in London, points repeated to the risk packed as also fresh fruit juices in connection with medicine taking to. In the context of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he beat alarm once more: A glass apple, oranges or grapefruit juice suffices to on the whole reduce the capaciousness of a certain essential medicine that these is eliminated practically and the health of the patients is endangered so. 
Grapefruit juice already was under suspicion to be responsible increase the effects of some medicine like antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, heart circulation medicine, anxiolytic and neurological means, up to toxic standards. 
Medicine IN danger? The same agency of the drug had warned mixes of the dangers of this and emphasized in a report in front of two years doctors and patients to pay attention to it which is drunk in connection with means such as Diazepan or Metadon. 
It isn't only grapefruit? According to the experts orange juice and apple juice also contain substances which can impede the drugs. 
The list of the active agents impeded by the fruit juices is long. 
Therefore the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately passed on to the different international manufacturers to whom it is so up to change the consumer information. 
It is therefore advisable to read the packet supplement always and to not ask any shyness to have a pharmacist or doctor, if there are still uncertainties, the expert of the Ansa agency emphasizes ". 
Economy Nobel prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economy Nobel prize is Paul Krugman to the American for its analysis of trade samples and the settlement of economic activities. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, which teaches at university of Princeton and noted for its regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of the economy and Aussenpolitik of the Bush administration. 
Krugman had claimed in a lead the New York Times a few months after the stops of September 11th, 2001 during the days of the Enron collapse this second event has been more decisive for the history of the USA than the assassinations. 
A forecast which which didn't receive little polemics as an answer and the economist still was reproached for years later, proves to be completely right today, however. 
"I am surprised and also shocked about this, how shoots the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or WorldCom has disappeared from the public field of vision", explained Krugman end 2002. 
An "economist of great value" is worth Krugman according to the Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive committee of the European Central Bank, but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style which is particularly aimed at the excessive liberalism of the Bush government". 
The third version of the "anti Microsoft" package is published Open Office it 
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open source software wins Microsoft Office a bigger and bigger number of users both at home and in the office both under freelance and in the public administration as a cost-free substitute. 
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers which is supervised by Sun Microsystems the new Open Office itself presents the audience with some novelties now: next to an initial menu revised and formed Spartan now one finally is now compatibility entirely ensured operating system Mac os x reached as well as the support with Apples for the new ODF (Open Document format) format, that is the latest standard ISO version given 1.2. 
Pay attention against furthermore was on the compatibility with a Microsoft Office 2007 whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx), can be read by Open Office. 
Are also some new feature programs, approximately that one which permits to reduce the size of Powerpoint presentations, in an interesting way what sending e.g. via e-mail makes easier. The possibility of importing PDF files into graphic processing modules and maintaining the original phenotype of the side at the same time also is part of it. 
So being able to to generate now also "hybrid" PDF files which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processor system. 
The cooperation is one of the elements of the applications improved most strongly: Tables can mehrhändig be processed by different users now, conflicts at changes be avoided through what; in the case of the word processor system a Frabe is assigned to every editor to one guarantee a better correction method so. 
Some companies just are about (on The Cloud) to publish different functions of Open Office on the Internet, the definite result shall publicly lasting be made within the next weeks. 
The Italian version stands left for the download on the following at the disposal: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It therefore follows the English version which has been on the mirrors since Friday. 
Os is the program Ausser availably for Windows and Mac also for the operating system Linux. 
On enquiry one can have his installation CD sent home or to the office. 
Open Office the cost liberty can be an incentive in the private households for the distribution of the program meanwhile, it is just that way in the area of the business, too where the great throw could be successful: different implementations of the public administration and schools to Open Office finally have already changed. 
Actually doesn't even there be a lack of a training supply which an optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises means and therefore reveals to even business prospects. 
Open Office consists of five principal ingredients: Writer, the Word corresponding text generation pro-grief; Which is aimed at a superseding of Excel Calc, this table pro-grief; Impress for the construction of presentations like with Powerpoint; DBASE for operating databases instead of the knowner Access; and last Draw, a graphic module. 
It is the target for the year 2008 to reach 5 million downloads? an aim 3 million reached this at already now and 600 one thousand can be exceeded also easily. 
Also cabbage tested positively and with that the fourth doping case 
A new doping case Mi Rahmen of the former tour de France opens: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, this one as third party classified and winner of the cotton jersey of the best climber. 
The message published the daily L team on its web page '. 
The 26-year cabbage of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who was tested positively on Cera, the EPO of the third generation. Before, this was already correct with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analyses from the blood tests cabbage be part of those which were concluded by the laboratories Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry within the last weeks. 
If the crosschecks confirm the positive results on Cera now, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the runnings for two years. 
The boss of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive EPO test and informs according to the Associated also press the Austrian responsible ones. 
The 26-year-old Austrian mounted behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans the platform and furthermore also used the shirt of the best climber for himself. 
Immigration topic: The new YORK Times asks: Is Italy racialist? 
"For a short time, Italy, one of the preferential countries has become the former country of the emigrants for immigrants who are taken only with reluctance". 
A nation of racialists make this from the Belpaese? This asks the New York Times in a long article, this one is completely dedicated to the topic of the racism in Italy and of the case the has young, Burkina Faso of sturdy Abdul William Guibre out goes out which was murdered in Milan a month ago after it had nicked a packet of cookies. 
The case shows what the Times as a "paradox of the north described" it: those are the northern regions most integration and work opportunities, in which " at the " insist, and "the highest degree of anti immigrationistischen sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega the north can nevertheless be recorded". 
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants the Times refers to further episodes of the intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not only this. 
The legislation against immigration and for the faster expulsion of the illegal immigrants which is new and brought in by the Lega is also specified as a sign of the climate change in Italy. 
A movement which the pope and the president also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the pope for a cooperation at a meeting on the Quirinal between church and state for the fighting the racism." 
Female students the victim this one up to 900 euros per room high Mietspreise 
The market for apartments doesn't know any crises for studying. 
According to the last examination of the Sunia, the tenant labor union, 650 in Naples and 600 can cost a single room a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, in Rome. 
"This phenomenon has already accepted very serious trains. Whole crowds of students lose so in actuality their right to study since their families are not able to support them in this height "?so the responsible person the Sunia, Laura Mariani?" the great demand leads on the part of the students in these towns to a deformation of the market which also has hurt the other inhabitants. 
Moreover, most renting offers contain a number of violations: liberal contracts, missing registrations without renting price limit, forbidden tenancies. 
For the Sunia there is the necessity after unusual measures which lead to lower rents by a revision of the taxation. 
At a more exact analysis of the examination proves that a sleep place be needed in the quarter Brianza approx. 450 euros in Milan; Vittoria starts with a single room at 650 euros (in the quarter gang Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the quarter. 
A sleep place costs on an average 350/400 euros, a room 700., in Florence 
250/280 euros are for a sleep place from needs, 370 to 500 for a single room, in Bologna where the students concentrate around the university in the quarters. 
The prices are in the quarters around the university at about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleep place in a double room, in Rome. 
The rents are only little lower in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Who makes way in outlying areas can save money only: 300 euros for a sleep place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar accommodations. 
One need in Naples, 300-450 euros for a sleep place the price is in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and collie Aminei between 400 and 600 euros for a room. 
A sleep place costs 250-350 euros, one single room at least 350. in Bari 
The prices are lower in the smallest towns but they have a greater weight in the municipal economy. 
In which ones to non-European students the phenomenon of the letting is more frequent such as in Perugia in the towns, even another Anomalie exists: one, rents which are above the average by 25-30 % are demanded by foreign students. 
Meetings to the old cinema Paradiso? the towns close their historical cinema halls 
The historical cinemas close due to the favored Multiplexkinos. 
"A town without cinema halls is a blind town, like a face without eyes." 
What is happening in the big urban centers of Italy and also in the provinces at the moment describes this picture of the director Giuseppe Tornatore with effect. 
The process of the marking off of the cinemas which started with the birth of the big multi-hall complexes in the periphery means the death for the one hall cinema in the long run in the center. A process which doesn't only seem inevitable and irrevocable but also carries the trains of a cultural crime. 
Concerned historical places full of memories usually shall, "it has to be lost like a friend with whom one has put a piece Strasse full of emotions back", so the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso" which earned it Oskar and the large price of Cannes 20 years ago. It is to live the history of a suburb cinema and its nostalgia which consists of it in a cinema world lost for ever well. 
The numbers deliver, the Anec, the central trade association which one speaks one considerably language: within the last five years the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas must have closed; the cinemas paid this check for the most part in the large towns: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The Emilia - Romagnas belong to the regions most deeply concerned, resulted for the Lombardy with 41. by the tuscany with 44 and with 82 lost cinemas 
This shows it that this one is main offenders the Multiplexkinos because these are just these three regions into which the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 within the last 5 years leads the Lombardy the lists on, it is 81 both in the tuscany and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has so Paolo Protti the president of the Anec developed in an irrational way ", " it is useful that also new structures give up but the receipt is at first place the already existing because a hall closes in the town aren't all his regular customers ready to go to a Multiplexkino instead of the old person in the periphery. 
Eight and still the missing budget stays outerly for the meat juices of the trade association: the debts recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros. 
It is a disgrace of the ethical moral point of view that the government doesn't observe the existing laws. 
To get the sector were between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of needs ". 
The case of Bologna, the first Italian town which has decided due to the worries about the old cinema halls to protect these by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec, is interesting; it is the first agreement of this way to protect and to support the traditional cinemas in Italy which aims at it and this both in the historical center and in the periphery. 
Under the foreseen measures also tax Bevorteilungen are regarding the short-distance traffic for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the audience: it will be permitted to go to the traffic limited areas of the center and in addition to park at more reasonable parking fees. 
"It is ", " a pleasant initiative so Giuseppe Tornatore, I hope that other towns will follow our example and draw up furthermore also new concepts. 
We also need a better audio and video equipment, certainly however, to be able to take a message for the Multiplexsäle against the superpower because the audience of today is finally more demanding. 
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the shutdown of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point which got me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso" even if I had played with the thought for 10 years already. 
For 25 years I have lived in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale in this one via Nazionale there where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn round aside to not have to see the dust covered posters. 
The connections between politics and ' lead Ndrangheta to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the mafia group of Piromalli. 
The accusations of the legal profession of the Antimafia authority Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and its representative Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro who were arrested this morning because of involvement in mafia business are serious. 
Gioacchino Piromalli was also taken into handcuffs, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration as well as his nephew: the advocate who bears the same name as the boss of the clan had already been convicted of involvement in criminal unions of the mafia, at that time to an amount of compensation of 10 million euros. 
"The two local administrations had decided to pay monies for advice activities to the advocate Piromalli disregarding every type of moral and legal norm ", write the advocates, " so." 
"It had therefore been made possible for the mafia group? so the judges? on an official way to penetrate into the city halls and to have an influence on the policy of the public administration." 
The president of the regional committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero doesn't say no it "anything but is an exception to discover connections of local administrations and the crime organized" in his region, that. "There are places, in which ones the concentration of the mafia is greater than into others in which such are practically unavoidable for unions. 
But there also are restaurant politicians, these this one ' resist Ndrangheta the pressure: A white vest gets itself heroes, these." 
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July with which the clan Piromalli was beheaded according to the police. 
The district council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro since the end of last April but already 1991? due to alleged connections between organized crime and the local administration and also at that time? the local politicians had been relieved of their local authorities. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, at that time mayor the Udc, has been elected the head of the Mitterechtskoalition after the final ballot of May 2006. 
Scandal as the prefecture shouted the dissolving of the district council he ordered. 
He prosecuted on this into the vice-Secretary of the Interior Marco Minniti whom he accused to have invented everything for political strategic reasons. However, the judges explain in connection with the warrant of this morning that the Piromalli clan even had dared to apply for a change of the A3 project. 
From a bugging operation in connection with the examinations to the case Dal Torrione which is as is well known a representative of the large group around the Piromalli has shown himself the readiness to meet the wishes of a businessman?through what the measures of the public administration got identical with the interests of this clan." 
If the energy arises from the waves, the great ones suddenly accumulate 
It is a source of income not drying up, which covers more than 70% of the surface of the planet and the great seem this to energy companies of the world only now to understand. 
Waves, flows and tides are the new renewable energy sources on these everyone looks now and tries also to occupy for giants like Chevron approximately. 
The possibility of winning energy out of the movements of the sea is drawn and examined already for 70 years into consideration; these studies didn't intensify themselves considerably since the first earth oil crisis by chance. 
As the price of the oil at 1980 one broke in the idea of the sea energy gasify, the environmental organizations and the oil price increased are pressing for new impulses in this sector now, however. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London guesses that 15% of the worldwide energy requirement could be covered by the energies produced by the ocean waves. 
This would amount to the double of the energy produced by nuclear power stations at the moment. 
In addition, the flows and tides would there be in addition. 
Giants at the attack. 
The first company which backs the sea energy now is Enersis which has signed a contract for the erection of a power station in the north of Portugal in the year 2005. 
You published as this message seemed to be a revolutionary step. 
It is more and more companies from the traditional energy industry now two years later which put power generation on the navy. 
"Chevron examines these technologies"? so the spokesman of an enterprise known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal? and the possibility weighs up cooperating with us." 
It is all about the obtaining of an admittance of the American energy commission which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a sign to be not underestimated, V . . if one considers that are furthermore oil is extracted by the USA just in Alaska and president Bush recently got the plans going first for new drillings. 
The companies Verdant energy Inc. from New York and Ocean energy from New Jersey which invest in the new line of business also are besides Chevron; if the details aren't known either, then observers talk about an increasing interest anyway. 
Still improvement worthy technologies. 
Experts talk, about a technology still being in the departure this the last doubts not least, here aren't cleared on the part of the environmentalists yet. 
Till now projects like that one are in Portugal and also Scotland of a rather small dimension and seem ecological problems to be taken seriously no to cause. 
To produce energy in a great scale, however, it requires technologies greater influence on the environment far. 
There are different possibilities: Energy approximately uses a system of buoys connected to each other Ocean. 
The push of the waves, and which one becomes within the swimmers over pistons and top-hats into a hydraulic pressure, moved down, the buoys on changed. 
This drives a turbine which in turn operates a generator. 
The current is sent to the coast on this over sub-water pipes. 
Up till now there is four planned plant of this type, which only wait for the state approval. A part of the won energy could serve also for military facilities. 
Meanwhile, Verdant energy already produces energy for a goods department store and a park bib with the help of submarine turbines in the East River of New York. 
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines, which eats the generator by the arising rotation. 
According to the Verdant a long snake already services the necessary authorizations from possible clients to use these energy sources. 
First the waves, then the tides. 
A special interest is earning the potential presently which is in the tides according to the institute for current extraction research. 
Although it also is an irregular phenomenon the tides are predictable a more trustworthy current source better as wind flows, the solar radiation and also the waves, and therefore anyway. 
It is definitely the tides energy which federal states like New York, Main and Alaska as well as further coastal states got to invest already 7.5 million dollars in the year 2008? for 2009 up to 35 millions are already planned.
