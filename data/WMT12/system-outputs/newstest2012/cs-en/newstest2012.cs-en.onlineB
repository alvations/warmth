Parliament did not support an amendment exempting Tymoshenko
Ukraine&#39;s parliament today rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the Criminal Code section under which the opposition leader was sentenced Yuliya Tymoshenko.
Treatment, which would open the way to liberation prisoners expremiérky, MPs rejected the second reading of the lenient sentences for economic offenses.
Tymoshenko in October was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into allegedly onerous contracts with Russia to purchase natural gas.
Judgment is not final, the appeal court has sentenced in December to discuss.
Tymoshenko has called for political revenge judgment mode, suspicion of bias caused the court process and in the West.
The proposal to fell the Penal Code section 365, on which the expremiérka convicted, provide support for 147 deputies voting.
His approval was needed 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The story of the liberation of Libyan or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to define the winner.
As is customary in the county, the Islamists win elections, but it&#39;s about whether moderate or radical.
Transitional National Council has agreed to a customary law and sharia, it was an idea we have.
Libya will become the country without crime, because the theft is cut hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, potential defectors from the faith awaiting execution, and so forth.
Instead people will be dictator company consisting of warring tribes unite the Koran.
In Libya will order what we can and can not imagine that we certainly do not.
But our way of life is neither the only nor the best objectively and probably would not suit for a change just to be mentioned Libyans.
Actually, it is surprising that Islamic militants have taken help from the infidels thankful dogs.
Sorry it is only that in their view did not follow the NATO bombing of an American general, but Allah, the size of each intervention celebrated hilarious.
So when looking for winners in Libya, the West is among them.
We engaged in a firefight, served Islam and our politicians get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally, without a guaranteed profit.
After a bad experience fresh from Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya does a militarily.
Thus there is no problem with the local expulsion of &quot;crusaders&quot;.
They will have no occupation but the oil companies for a song Libyan black gold?
Perhaps not, and the West will finally be able to boast selfless protection of human rights.
If we therefore does not interfere with the followers of sharia law.
A new era of crisis.

Diet of obese children: nesnídá and dinner sausages
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 years, has problems with being overweight, and overweight schoolchildren has 9 percent and 5 percent of the obese children.
However, most obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as indicated by current research.
Again shows how important it is for healthy human development environment in which it grows, and patterns, which is surrounded.
The tables in obese children, for example, appear to be half smoked more often than children in families with normal weight.
French fries had for dinner the day before the research associated with educational events called Obesity is not a coincidence more than 19 percent obese.
In families is not always the fat man in sports, which, however, concerns of most families today&#39;s school children - only 15 percent of children said that their parents at least once a week, find time for active movement.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and was attended by nearly 900 children from primary schools around the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of action Obesity is not a coincidence that supports the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, the project involved more than 12 000 pupils from the 4th to 8 classes.
Proper diet and plenty of exercise while the family is one of the determining factors that causes dramatically rising number of children are overweight or even obese.
&quot;Only half of the respondents for example, reported that her five times a day under the breakfast-brunch-lunch-snack-dinner, which is one of the basic prerequisites of proper nutrition,&quot; is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that for the healthy development are essential and relative details, including time to be a regular family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic while eating breakfast at the same time only 23 percent of the families of schoolchildren.
In most families eating breakfast alone.
And the worst was that in the tenth household nesnídá all.
Breakfast is the foundation while the proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children are more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinking fresh lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although regular exercising more than 40 percent of children with their parents but the result was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your diet
Another part of the survey enabled the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compile your own from the options menu according to your own taste and personal opinion.
&quot;Dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years in terms of having a healthy diet far from ideal.&quot;
Among their favorite foods is a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
&quot;It is alarming especially great popularity of sweet soft drinks,&quot; says a final report on the survey.
For lunch as a main dish pasta won just over chicken.
Children did not want to do virtually nothing but beans and low popularity is the lunch of fish and vegetable dishes.
Shift towards health
The survey also showed that children are willing to modify their eating habits if they get the correct information.
&quot;In the control group of survey participants who filled out a questionnaire after the educational lecture Obesity is not a coincidence, occurred in many cases a significant preference shift towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&quot; says the results of the project.
It was striking example of sweet soft drinks, where they began to have more children prefer plain water.
Children also checked more frequently in the questionnaire, poultry and fish as a main meal of the day and limit sweet foods and dumplings.
Stylist must also be a good psychologist, says pros
In the opening article on how to teach stylists, I complained a bit that this was the opening hours of the lot.
I had no idea what will follow.
Lectures three pros in the field, troubled characters and dressing up a seminar on how to go about the place.
And it will be worse.
The closer to the final test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
And even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, is really &quot;crack&quot;.
This time we discussed with the director Alenka (of course not the only boy), dressed as a woman who has a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And such is the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, boyish figure someone again without the proper curves and again someone overweight.
Stylist must know how to visually soften broad shoulders, neck and extended to provide the necessary curves.
We got the tips on how to type in a woman Jennifer Lopez, that is, larger breasts and hips and narrow waist, nice figure and emphasize a woman simultaneously neobléknout too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips such that the skirt or trousers really does not fit, then it pays to have at least one such tailor-made piece.
Certainly you will not regret it perfectly fitting clothing is priceless.
The tailored skirt, you will feel much better than the one that will constantly shifting, rolled up, standing off at the waist and the like.
Boys turn the character can afford to wear clothing with folds, applications, or by collecting embroidery.
Such information and types of characters is of course a lot, so I&#39;m glad I have a whole week for me to have all the information summarized in the head.
And, I&#39;m afraid that due to the given homework that is enough.
Each is given kurzistek assigned celebrity, which has come up with two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current design, fashion style and the personality type of character.
I will &quot;dress&quot; Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from Victoria&#39;s Secret campaigns.
In the spirit of rejoicing for me personally, definitely better than those Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a hundred pounds (Please keep in mind hyperbole), Selena Gomez or wort.
Clothes have to cut out from magazines or search online and print graphically and then processed.
Moodboard as a whole the result says, and then express our personal style and relationship to graphic design.
Think about the graphical styling is important.
Stylist is neobléká only physically, but also creates a so-called product pages for example in magazines (to specific tasks, such as trends, handbags, coats, etc.).
Told us about that stylist and designer Mario Stonemason.
But until Sunday.
Stylist must have a general overview
Saturday charged a lecture about the types of characters diversified by three guests from the field.
Stylist Jan Pokorny, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should be able to use it.
A good stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability in this case is crucial.
So to be such a trench coat (or if you originally Trenchcoat) can be worn over jeans and classic t-shirt as a jacket, but you can also put on the bare body, put on heels and a dress shoot.
Or just roll up our sleeves and collar, and now the whole look is different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; stressed.
But I most appreciated the following advice: &quot;The work you need to know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;Then you can begin to break,&quot; said James.
Finally, it is clear to me why we excel in all these propositions, combined with what what, what, why, when yet in fashion magazines, sometimes we see something else.
The shows not to mention.
Thanks to photographer Ben again, I know that stylist must have prepared a lot more clothing options than they shoot it.
So the fashion story that will have ten pages (ie, ten outfits), I have to be prepared &quot;nastajlovat&quot; at least fifteen.
And that dress in the photo looks and works in combination with other pieces of sometimes very different than in reality.
With that, we have to count when making outfit.
Image and style that often makes up half the success, we confirmed John Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna, the singer is not exactly magic, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic has access to use the services of stylists rather cold.
Even familiar faces can sometimes considered unnecessary (just know that something I can do, how I look at it, is secondary).
And if you already have from us lets anyone create styling, then we have to keep in mind that we are likely to dictate a completely different (smaller) size than actually has.
Then the left than Google&#39;s and find out if the tabloids did not write that, given celebrity ztoustla / lost weight and so on.
John and Mary on Sunday, we put on the heart, the stylist is not enough to focus on fashion and be able to put together outfit.
In my work primarily communicates with people dressed, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Be able to assess people nepodbízet to stand up for their opinion.
&quot;If you ordered a manager to her wardrobe protřídili and added some nice pieces of it, so it can not throw a box and say, God, that&#39;s awful.&quot;
&quot;There are a couple of things to praise and recommend what you can wear,&quot; says Mario.
He showed us concretely what to include so-called &quot;placovka&quot; or bag set.
It&#39;s the one you turn around your waist and you possess all the necessary accoutrements.
In addition to clear things like scissors, roll the hair or safety pins, there are also nylon thread (it helps with your stylist photography products such as handbags and hats), special clips, which closes behind clothing if it is greater (pin or other terminal is not permitted, destroying the clothing), or sewing kit.
We just did not hear them, but they also tried practically anything, we learned how to podlepit shoes.
Even when shooting in the studio, where a flat surface, it may damage the sole, let alone outside.
So we are stuck and stuck.
Using scissors, the bot must not even touch that accidentally damaging.
It is really necessary skill.
Mario comforted me when my work unqualified praise.
Advertised skill is really not my friend.
This is only a tiny fraction of what we continue on the second weekend of the course hear.
It starts me to be more and more clear that given the styling on a professional level is really not a cakewalk, let people say what he wants.
Need for Speed: The Run is a race across America.
Review
Originally carefree ride due to a series of sloppy mistakes entirely unnecessary changes in the routine way to the morning shift.
Ambition is true to a large extent managed to fill, but it&#39;s not valid when you obviously did not want anyone to do anything extra.
New volume, subtitled The Run alert before the high expectations.
He promised that the long-standing racing series Need for Speed ​​again moves towards a new piece of playable demos and appeared to be a game that would be in the genre of action may not be racing in just a number.
We were also curious about what happens inserted passages in which the main character of the car and will be held at his.
As NFS series but it is customary, many of them in slightly different result than we expected.
They are potentially decent arcade racing, but a whole pulls down a few unnecessary errors that appear in a series of more or less for several years.
So it&#39;s actually not even mistakes, but rather a kind of incomprehensible speech lazy developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You mentioned a story whose main character Jack has some problems of a personal nature and is offered as a solution to participate in an illegal race across America.
Sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea brings some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then to more than fifty races.
It follows that every race goes to the track and the other stages are set in different, different enough and interesting environment.
One does not have a moment to feel that the game offered the same thing.
Some of the environment are also very pretty to look at, even though the technical level of graphic works in line with previous series.
So it&#39;s not much to brag about.
But the journey across the desert, autumn landscape, or high in the snowy mountains has very visually pleasing.
Races are also diversifying from time to time some atypical feature.
In the desert, for example přimotáte to sandstorms, which greatly reduces visibility.
In contrast, in the mountains again you have to be careful that you nezasypala avalanche.
In addition, they are well deployed behind the races.
Although there are only a few types, but just that.
He is trying to overtake the number of opponents (in fact a classic race), then again catching up with time (a classic duel with a stopwatch) and then waiting for you to be a duel with a single opponent.
In this still from time to time and the police alike, that all your efforts even more disturbing.
New passages are outside the vehicle.
Rather, it is just such an interactive animation, mostly from Jack when someone flees him and you in that you must help so that in just the right moments print button.
Nothing complicated.
Surprise, however, that these passages in the game is much less than you&#39;d expect (specifically, perhaps only three).
In the end, but it&#39;s a good thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying in the context of the said amount is now one of the elements that punctuated the game.
Driving model goes in the footsteps of previous episodes.
This means that today it is definitely not who knows what, but you can not say that was negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But akčněji conceived of the local road racing model fits still quite good, although at the competition we could find better.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
But problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the model is already driving power in the collision model is not okay.
Since we do not expect this type of game that calculates the complex deformation and collision, but when virtually no impact to the front of any object you do not have the slightest idea how to maintain your car, it probably is not everything in order.
Typically close to overtaking or passing cars in normal operation is sometimes only lightly lick each other, but sometimes in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild spins.
Or even straight to smithereens.
Thanks to the system restarts it although not particularly mind, but your moods, it reliably.
Restarts are designed so that if you ride away or smashed off the track, the game throws you back to the last clue on the track.
But restarts in each race only five available.
When you reach, you must start the race again.
So it is rather a dummy, in case something goes wrong than that you could literally they rely.
But sometimes even reboots do not help solve the need to learn by heart the section of the race.
A great infirmity game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some of the corners so as to test the specific way, otherwise it simply will never enter into them.
Sometimes you will meet again at the place of &quot;civilian&quot; cars always in the same configuration whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
It sucks, especially in situations when you see oncoming cars between two rival easily passes in front of you while you drive when there are no cars in a position that you must slow down or detour.
It does not matter when they arrive, because it is &quot;calculated&quot; to a given situation was always close to your nose.
Opponents also have another advantage.
To play all the time you come across a few places where you, again regardless of the time, always overtakes the same opponent in the same place.
Most striking is the conclusion of the game on a long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The adversary must be there before you get obviously perhaps at any price.
When going before you, giving you an overview of the worse because of oncoming cars, so there are probably a couple of times initially rozmašírujete nicely.
One can understand the intention to make the game exciting and adrenalinovější, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgusted.
And it&#39;s a shame, because despite the simple model is driving fun and playing well enough action points that sometimes literally are not able to see where that flies.
And it basically does not matter if it has the merit concept with fifty unique track, shifter races to boredom no chance, or anything else.
Unconventional idea is to change cars during races.
Care must be taken at a gas station along the roads, because there you can change the car, although in most cases to make do with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American Muscle Cars on the highway straight and exotic supercars on technical riding, for example, the winding mountain roads.
The main narrative mode goes hand in hand mode challenges, which are plants in different locations, you know the story.
You get not only medals, but experience points to your profile, which is common to call the story.
To obtain higher levels of driver unlock various things: cars starting and ending with backgrounds for your profile.
He is also connected again with online functions Autolog, which also compares your achievements with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the more difficult the situation is understandable kicks from the last race in the story.
With his car to get to the subway tunnel (okay), where a woman in the dark tracks (okay).
The tachometer will flash numbers between 150 and 200 km / h (be it) and it comes in from behind the kit and uncompromisingly underground sešrotuje you.
The editors are probably more so for a few days last debate on whether to create games no one really thought a little, or whether the authors have for us really as big a fool.
The technical aspect of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is usually very pleasant and in some cases even great.
So pity that in some tenser moments decreases imaging, and in some cases, tragically enough.
This applies to crashes but also a number of participants, which would give you a smooth imaging was not valid anyway.
Audio page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to the widest range of rather younger audience was the soundtrack from &quot;other dog every village&quot;, but it can be assumed that because the game listening to music just about anyone will buy.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run is so greatly embarrassed.
If the game is completely avoiding unnecessary mistakes, then we were not afraid to say that the best is The Run NFS work over the past few years.
Way but the game has not finished.
Entertainment is certainly fine, but be prepared that errors will batter you in the eye power of airport lights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation negativists and Eurosceptics
&quot;The Lisbon Treaty very much disturbed the balance between individual institutions.&quot;
&quot;I did not expect it would be such a hard war.&quot;
&quot;It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, calm down, and before all players get used to his new role,&quot; she said sharply, his lecture at the Law Faculty of Czech Ambassador to the EU Milena Vicenova.
How its motto &quot;clearly and openly about Europe&quot; takes seriously, it showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relationship is so clear and comprehensible manner, that it could be a number of lecturers from the Law Faculty of envy.
Vicenová also praised the work of new permanent European Council President Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;First appeared a criticism, it is dull, it&#39;s official gray, it can not fulfill any role, and I must say that all taken aback, then, that assuming the role perfectly.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s someone who can listen to twenty-seven Member States to communicate very well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.&quot;
A new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, then explained in answer to the question: &quot;Who is it that the European Union? Which phone number do I call?&quot;, Ie as an important step toward unification and greater readability EU policy towards countries such as China and India.
Nobody wants us to disable Cake of riping cheese
Vicenová she devoted herself to the agenda by the European Council lived, lives and will live in the near future.
Czech Presidency Předloňské labeled a success.
Czechs dealt with the emerging financial crisis, or solve the gas crisis summit held on the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at this time identified as the major negative aspect, which the Czech Republic strongly damaged.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the ambassador, &quot;a fact hoopla&quot; was not only the presidency but also the subsequent financial crisis that is solved now.
Moreover, still must approve the new seven-year budget of the Union, which was due to the current economic situation considerably more complicated.
Whether the budget is lean and economical, the industry will take precedence, which countries will be supported by more and less, it&#39;s all on the agenda for next meeting.
The Ambassador also reiterated their main slogans with which it came to Brussels: &quot;Europe clearly.&quot;
&quot;I really do not like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As a citizen to understand that really invent the Brussels round or curved cucumbers, bananas and a variety of large or really anyone that we must ban cheese. &quot;.
It also wants to make better use of EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
There will be a multi-speed Europe
According to the Ambassador of Czech Eurosceptics reputation and the people who pay attention to the rather negative than positive aspects of the matter.
In addition, she wished the low representation of Czechs in European Institutions.
The fault lies in its many factors, such as modesty of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency has highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
&quot;Believe me that when it comes to me Poles and Hungarians and Slovaks are coming, so the Frenchman next to me says,&quot; Hey, what&#39;s come together, again what yours Visegrad Four? &quot;And not pretend to it enthusiastically.&quot;
In the future, according to the Union Vicenová waiting especially tough new rules for budgetary policies of member countries.
As a very real perception of the concept of two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, rather than a new &quot;European federation.&quot;
&quot;We have a euro-zone countries and countries outside the eurozone.&quot;
&quot;We Schengen area, we have enhanced cooperation and institution.&quot;
&quot;The first time was told to cooperate only country who want and those that do not want to be standing nearby.&quot;
&quot;These institutes will be more and it will be a strong two-speed Europe,&quot; expects Vicenová.
In this respect also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle according to which all are issues that affect the whole of the Union debate between all Member States, not only among euro area countries.
Brand story:
Innovator IBM begins its second century of existence
If anyone was looking for a word that expresses precisely the strategy IBM, the closest would probably be &quot;patient&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very contemporary, yet since it was founded a hundred years have passed.
The basis of the sustainability of the company laid the first boss, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr..
Already he coined the slogan that many of the world&#39;s problems can be easily resolved if people are willing to think.
His motto, &quot;Think!&quot; imprint that happened around which life will depend on future giant (and also called internal magazine that began publication in IBM back in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully crafted corporate culture.
&quot;For us, of IBM&#39;s long-term thinking means a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM has survived and prospered for a hundred years that remained true to its core values ​​and yet afraid everything else around you change.
This allowed us during our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second hundred that we manage to achieve even more, &quot;said the anniversary of the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano.
Sophisticated system
Watson approached the thirties to care for their employees as an entrepreneur Bata in the Czech Republic - the people at IBM were among the first U.S. employees paid leave, insurance from the employer plus employee uniforms elegant and sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and businessmen.
Equally sophisticated and IBM has a long relationship with the customer.
The company was brilliant from the start of mining talent - one of the first world companies abolish any discrimination, so you can choose from.
In line with the strategy of anti-discrimination is the current plan, headed by Palmisano that IBM will succeed in the next year a woman - Virginia Rometta.
The IBM has been working for thirty years, yet he is the boss of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years makes the so-called yams, online brainstorming sessions, which raises many of the strategies and innovations.
Not surprisingly, the idea is enough - the company operates nearly half a million people.
An institution with a reputation
Fixed position in the company&#39;s business provides a strong internal and external image.
&quot;From the beginning the concept was IBM&#39;s institutions rather than just technology companies,&quot; said the Economist Harvard Business School professor and author of books about IBM Kanter Rosabeth Moss.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company but a company that helps solve problems for Business use technology,&quot; said George Colony of Forrester Research consulting firm.
As the company itself says, the difference between the market and enter the market directly create.
IBM - or &quot;Big Blue&quot; as it is because of its logo in the United States familiarly dubbed - in a hundred years has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - develops hardware and software, infrasturukturu, hosting and consulting services in the range of products, from servers to nanotechnology.
He holds the most U.S. patents in all technology companies and five of its employees received the Nobel Prize.
Among her inventions are to be ATM, credit card, financial swaps, bar code or disk.
IBM has around 220 billion dollars this year became the second largest technology company by market capitalization (the first is Apple), the first time since 1996, ahead of Microsoft.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations to hit the taste of customers and time - for example, IBM failed to bet on their own operating system, OS / 2, on-line services and Prodigy IBM PCjr.
&quot;If your business is built on moving forward, emotionally can not draw on the past,&quot; poznamává to Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build their foundations on many platforms - and when not working, so leave it.
In contrast to Microsoft&#39;s competition, which basically stands or falls on the Windows operating system.
Technology Perspective
IBM in sales is primarily attributable to service, after about one fifth of them are software and hardware.
It still was in 1990 with more than half of the strongest representative of the hardware.
Since 2000, IBM sold a few profitable assets worth $ 15 billion during the same period of $ 58 billion invested in the purchase of promising technologies.
The investment is continuing since 2008, when the first modern swept the world financial crisis.
IBM is by reference to his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the Great Depression, also increased the volume of investment.
So far it seems that IBM through the current crisis intact.
IBM&#39;s share price since the beginning of 2008 rose 120 percent of the rocket, the company net profit has grown continually.
IBM&#39;s corporate motto to change everything, but their values ​​Sun
It can therefore expect that even if there will be another crisis, this giant flexible it can handle.
History of IBM: From cheese slicers for space flights
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally had a difficult Computing Tabulating Recording the name of the Corporation.
The name IBM gave up in 1924 - originally it was a mark used for branch offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for the subsequent merger of IBM gave four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
Owned technologies such as the famous &quot;time clock,&quot; the clock record the employee&#39;s arrival and departure.
Architect of the new company was businessman Charles Flint Ranlett, which until 1930 also chaired the supervisory board.
Flint hired a chief competitor of Thomas J. Watson to help him with the management company.
The leader then overshadowed by the founder of IBM - Watson at the thought still built invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of machines for all sorts of business - from meat and cheese cutters after the box office.
During the first four years since Watson headed the company, turnover has doubled to nine million dollars and began an extensive expansion of firms in all continents.
Watson was indispensable for the company so that after almost forty years in the chair, his place and he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM has begun work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the sixties, people and computers from IBM helped manage NASA&#39;s space flights - the Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
Classic &quot;PC,&quot; which raised the standard of computer time, called the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC production to Lenovo of China, on the contrary acquired the consulting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully focus on consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy, which in the past three years paid IBM - Smarter Planet is a concept, a &quot;smarter planet&quot;.
Its aim is to use smart technologies yet to be or unplanned areas, such as improvements in transport and urban governance.
For the area of ​​trade introduced the IBM platform &quot;Smarter Commerce,&quot; which helps retailers manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in this country.
Established a branch in Czechoslovakia back in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.

Worst female vices: These refer to you as well?
When you ask men if they could name some typical female vices, usually every one is very quick to dump on his sleeve.
Dear women, you&#39;ll be in the following lines, where women are some bad habits that can pump up the perfect men&#39;s blood?
Shopping
You accused your other half, you&#39;re dependent on a shopping trip?
You have to buy yourself at least one rag week?
Like you buy in bulk and discounts?
Then, in your case to talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women are aware that should my passion nakupovatelskou a bit tame.
But tell that to resist this, just browse around the shops with clothes, looking at each well-fitting clothes and then all of them (ideally in different colors) in the test booth?
Although for most women shopping hobby, for men can become virtually finished hell.
Just remember how many times have you told her that, whether you prefer to wait in front of ...
Constant dissatisfaction
&quot;I&#39;m too fat?&quot;
&quot;I need to lose weight at least five pounds - I should start practicing?&quot;
&quot;Do you ever?&quot;
Resembling those phrases you something?
Is not it?
Then you&#39;re one of those women who are obsessed by how they look.
Not that you should take care of myself stop, but a lot of men are allergic to it directly, as their partner is constantly complaining about their appearance.
The stronger sex is the same also that the higher the frequency of complaining increases, the women are annoying.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It&#39;s like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, mopping floor tiles, dusting, scrubbing the tub - at least twice a week.
Reproach partner that stepped foot on the dirty pavement clean, the children that mess opatlaly scrubbed sink and glass wall units, with which you are polishing gave so much work?
In the event that you suffer by this &quot;aberration&quot;, try to remember that nothing should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness should definitely be in the family first.
This harmless because the desire for purity can jeopardize your relationship and family well-being.
Digging
&quot;You used shorts throw in the trash.&quot;
&quot;The old socks you&#39;ll also take on tomorrow?&quot;
&quot;The wet cloth on the ground did not belong.&quot;
If your partner in this rýpete several times a day, you know, so that it can reliably call.
Of course, do not mean no harm, do you want to make everything was fine.
Maybe if the men knew the women would not have them not so much poke ...
Biting, scratching
For some women are also owns rumors, gossip, as well as abuse and conspiracy against someone.
Women are more focused on relationships, and so together they discuss things like the type who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us a little harmless gossip or rumor here and there omitted.
Hand on heart, it is common to almost all women.
The opposite of gossip but are rankest, who like Slander and often, perhaps every despise and to their environment - especially in women working team - especially dangerous.
Jagr and Voráček assists helped Philadelphia to win
Hockey forward Jaromir Jagr took part in Monday&#39;s NHL assists to win two mA Philadelphia 5:3 on ice Carolina and is again at the forefront of productivity of Czech players in the competition.
The overview devětatřicetileté stars mined in both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the game.
Two assists in a match and saw teammate Jakub Voracek Jagr.
Jagr overseas reporters after the match said that Giroux predicted a big night.
&quot;Even before the match I told him to give the hat trick.&quot;
&quot;I felt it.&quot;
&quot;Sometimes you overcome by a feeling,&quot; said Jagr, whose action gave the Giroux goal of the first shots Flyers.
A moment later he had a second Czech team hit the track.
Voráček goal for the Hurricanes won the wheel and brought him into the circles skórujícímu Maxim Talbot.
Second before the first break down the weakening domestic player Patrick Dwyer, but the second part of the introduction was Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
After collaborating with Jagr scored the third goal, then morphed his shot on the fourth goal is leaking Wayne Simmonds.
&quot;I love playing with him.&quot;
&quot;I do not say that the best player in the league, but certainly among the best three,&quot; Jagr appreciated its center.
&quot;I never thought that I would end my career as a hockey player to play with him.&quot;
&quot;From what I have joy.&quot;
&quot;I want to play him.&quot;
&quot;All those years in the NHL with my teammates tried to play me, now it turns,&quot; said Jagr.
Carolina did not match the drama that goal by Tuomo Ruutua Dwyer and again, that was enforced from the shot, got the one goal difference.
Other complications but did not read Matt, who finished outnumbered two to one.
&quot;Good hit Pronger in our zone.&quot;
&quot;Vypíchnul disc, I took a speed (Read) went to the far pole.&quot;
&quot;I tried to hit him and I&#39;m glad it worked out,&quot; described the last wicket match from my point of view Voracek.
Philadelphia the victory came at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Czech defenseman Jaroslav Spacek nedohrál Montreal game against Buffalo, resigned in the second period due to injury in the upper body.
Candiens alongside experienced dvoubrankové Beka lost the lead and lost the shootout 2-3.
One of their raids not turned Tomas Plekanec.
Domestic coach rather than sorry lost points back among large sick bay, the game play out only five defenders.
&quot;It&#39;s bad.&quot;
&quot;The match we play out with just one experienced player, the rest were young men.&quot;
&quot;But with this, simply do nothing, we have to deal with it,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Relief for changing it rolled up to us and we could not resist.&quot;
&quot;We had more to simplify the game, move the puck from our zone.&quot;
In this space we had, &quot;said one of the defensemen PK Subban.
Czech goalie Ondrej Pavelec thirty interventions contributed to Winnipeg win 5-2 over Tampa Bay.
The goals Jets, who discontinued pětizápasovou series of losses, is divided by five different shooters.
As prices have developed tours since 1989
Until 1989, Czechoslovakia was allowed to travel only five state agencies Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time sold only in the vast majority of trips to the socialist bloc countries, since travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists to travel on vacation to the beach to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the USSR (the Crimea Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and Hungary (Lake Balaton).
A positive exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav regime, however, inclined to the West and Czech tourists travel to Yugoslavia were consequently very limited.
A great paradox of socialism was that it was not the citizens of the socialist bloc (ie, the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel individually or in the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to leave Czechoslovakia individually such as in Poland or the Soviet Union and this country need an invitation letter to an individual not otherwise be possible path.
Travel agencies offer at the time and travel to the West, but had to stand the queue overnight sleeping bag or a travel agent to have &quot;known good&quot;.
Even so, it was won.
The so-called. exchange promise, which was a condition for traveling to the West, was awarded the &quot;politically unreliable people&quot; who do not travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency is not freely convertible currency, without the promise of foreign exchange was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on a journey to the West.
But by far the most Czechs spend holidays at home, which was due to a large number of lodges and cottages, which the Czechs procure and this custom still survives.
Travelling Czechs and since 1989 has experienced a real revolution.
While the year 1989 was a holiday in the GDR and Bulgaria to our maximum, Czechs spent last year abroad 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
Great paradox that you already realize, is that for us to present the most popular in Croatia was not possible to travel freely in 1989 as it was then part of Yugoslavia.
Just early 90th of the last century there was a visa waiver to neighboring Western European countries, which started a huge wave of mainly short-term visits Vienna in Austria and Germany.
Czechoslovaks could not get enough of the long trips to the West, where everyone wanted at least a second look.
For example, in Paris tours Czechs slept in tents in parks, because then our income did not allow us to be able to pay hotel or guest house.
A typical feature of the Czechs were traveling in the car at your own meals, canned foods, sausages, etc., in order to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of convertible Czech crown, and our tourists could finally, after many years destítkách freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and thus the average salaries rose, however, which resulted in around 1997 another important moment.
With increased demand for travel agents began traveling regularly since 1997 to prepare the charter air travel connections, making air travel thanks to the contracted volume discounts compared with the past incredibly cheaper.
End of the 90 of the last century had already Czechs visa virtually all developed countries except the U.S., which continues to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel occurred once in 2000 when he was dispatched by strong demand from the Czech Republic&#39;s first ever direct charter flight to the exotic, it was in Thailand.
From this year, so each year with Czech tourists vylétávají direct charters to warmer far-off lands, this winter will fly directly from CR longer than twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic currently visiting the country has around 100 thousand Czechs year!
Another interesting point in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
17th November 2008 canceled U.S. visas for Czech tourists and thus our country definitely ranks among the most advanced country in the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent time in history more than half their holidays abroad (50.3%) and the first time ever spent on a holiday abroad, including the cost of the whereabouts of more than 15 thousand. CZK per person.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again there is a stalemate
Almost five months without football, the Czech President and the risk that successor Ivan Hasek led the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not know for another EGM to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
Still, there is no agreement, according to what the Electoral Code to proceed.
Without it even begins to vote on which of three candidates will be elected.
Interest in Czech football have lead Rajchl Henry, Miroslav Pelt and Thomas Paclík.
Hasek, resigned in June and called upon his retirement colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
But in the era after Hasek slid back to the football between the two půtkám svazovými chambers, which are unable to agree on a common candidate.
It fully proved 16th September, when the new president should be chosen.
Delegates to the General Meeting of the National House in Prague arrived in vain, because the negotiations remain blocked and was not just a method of choice.
There is no consensus regarding the right to vote at the meeting actually - if only statutory representatives or officials authorized power of attorney.
In this single point, since there was a partial match, which helped the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law under which the representation by proxy is not possible.
But there are still disputes about the electoral code.
Too light on the situation nor did introduce the executive committee, which has at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in fact does not solve anything.
View of the option is changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round, to prevent the heel?
&quot;The dispute is over whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or find a different model,&quot; said one of three vice FAČR Dusan Svoboda, who represents the association in the management of professional football.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round of the winning candidates will have a greater percentage of support in the chamber, which stands for.
Moravia is reportedly willing to go to the concession to win the candidate who obtains a higher percent of the total votes of both chambers.
A Czech side enforces the condition that the winner in this percentage must get at least two-thirds census superiority.
&quot;But it would make sense then forfeit two previous rounds, it would completely negate the concept of a bicameral,&quot; understands the Freedom Moravian objections, that would be the best choice of procedure and not bending under the applicable statutes.
With this agrees surprisingly well Paclík Thomas, although it is estimated that the statutes designated election procedure meets most of all candidates Pelt.
&quot;I wish to be voted up by the statutes.&quot;
&quot;That is nonsense did not invent a wildcard as the last General Assembly,&quot; said owner Victoria Plzen, which stands for the first time and in explaining their observations, especially against the Pelt.
Pelt remains optimistic.
In Nymburk according to him, the new president know and believe that the candidates together will work constructively in the future.
&quot;All passions soothe any progress today on the national team championship.&quot;
&quot;Football is again a happy wave will be greater willingness to cooperate,&quot; said Officer Jablonec, which has all three of the greatest football management experience in both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is restrained.
&quot;I hope the agreement, but unfortunately the situation is much torn.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adjust the assigned requirements.&quot;
&quot;This can cause the block to the General Assembly will again.&quot;
&quot;But I hope that sanity will prevail,&quot; said Rajchl.
The agreement of all parties have much time left.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the match will not complete football generals.
Aerial special in which they travel to Podgorica including Vice Dalibor Rajchl and Kucera, namely from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure has not flown away, looking for the alternative option as part of the Executive Committee to deliver a venue barážové retaliation.
Finally, it may be a crucial meeting at ministerial level, which may be alleged in the center.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Josef Dobes would like to split caused by the strongest within the sports associations in the country to an agreement.
The game is a lot: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the forthcoming General Meeting of CSTV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport Sazka after financial problems.
Paclík going to fight for the President because there is no suitable candidate
If the head football Plzen Tomas Paclík before an extraordinary general meeting saw a strong candidate that would meet all his ideas about the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), nor to fight for the top position known.
&quot;If there was a good novice, I&#39;m fighting for it and going into the election.&quot;
&quot;But the current situation could not find anyone like,&quot; said ČTK Paclík.
The battle with Miroslav Pelt and Henry Rajchl herds Paclík motivation to just Pelt, alleged election favorite, tried to avoid the journey to lead FAČR.
Paclík also points out that if his victory would be as President lasted only until 2013, when the scheduled Annual General Meeting.
In the future, the function would like to see an experienced and top executive who is not linked to football events.
&quot;With some people who would come into consideration, I have spoken.&quot;
&quot;For me it was crazy, though some say that at this moment, with the Czech football do not want to identify.&quot;
&quot;Such a sight I would like to change,&quot; he said.
Paclík says now matters more than anything else Peltovo liaison with the President by Regional Football Association Berbrem Roman, a man with a controversial reputation, which is known backstage as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting delegates at the General Meeting.
For Paclík is so unacceptable that Pelt became the presidential position.
&quot;If they won, so the pause button on the current state and nothing in football should not move forward.&quot;
&quot;In combination with support Berbra who is savvy trader, it did not help even more football,&quot; said Paclík.
Impact and that the name Peltovo years ago came the wiretapping in the investigation of corruption scandals, of which, however, Pelt went unpunished.
&quot;I do not know what prestige would Peltovo football victory would bring.&quot;
&quot;And we also look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA,&quot; said Paclík, but that it also takes it easy with his former statement that would &quot;sell Pilsener Club, Pelt if he became chairman.&quot;
In the event that Paclík in Thursday&#39;s election triumph, he could have imagined but Pelt future cooperation.
Just considering other candidate Rajchl which Paclík supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
&quot;He (Pelt) would be the first for whom I went.&quot;
&quot;He has great ability.&quot;
&quot;I could imagine him to be as head of representation.&quot;
&quot;But a manager should manage the association failed.&quot;
&quot;I also nestrkám nose where it can not,&quot; said Paclík, in September attracted much attention by standing for appeal of arbitration commission headed by Ludek Mácel, which replaced the Damková Dagmar.
Paclík claims that he dared to lead the association.
Refers to the ability of its management of private companies since last summer boss also Pilsen, with its support in May celebrated the premiere league triumph.
&quot;I have to force it to be in a football environment has changed something to contribute to its particular culture.&quot;
&quot;To reduce the effects of some interest groups that tend to be disciplinary influence and Appeal Board, which treats up to unsavory situations,&quot; said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, the Spartan chief Daniel Křetínskému.
One of the priorities would also consider a closer relationship with FAČR Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of political leaders should lobby for it to get into the sport more money from the lottery tax.
&quot;It&#39;s one of the key things that should give the new President.&quot;
&quot;If there is a gambling tax to declare a political party, so I understand their argument, but frankly have to say where the money will go,&quot; he said.
As a burden now does not Paclík its association with Pilsner club, although he claims that the President FAČR should be &quot;non-partisan.&quot;
Pelt is in turn associated with Jablonec, Dukla Prague with Rajchl.
&quot;It&#39;s not ideal.&quot;
&quot;I do not see nor sense in me hypocritical for someone transferring their shares in the Pilsen club and a year and a half back there,&quot; said Paclík.
Pelt FAČR promised new statutes that would eliminate the electoral stalemate
Two days before the general meeting of the football associations of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelt promised that, if elected, endeavor to have FAČR new statutes that would definitely avoid future disputes over election rules.
Jablonec Thursday before the official is acting in Nymburk optimist and believe that the election campaign substantially dampen the potential success of today&#39;s football team.
Pelt had not made before the September option promised that on the representation and acquisition finance, if elected, intends to concentrate.
The last elections before the General Assembly decided to go at the last minute, so he could throw a two-month delay to his ideas about the governance of football defended and presented in a broader context.
&quot;People at all levels of football are doing for a long time and expect that on Thursday the President of the unknown.&quot;
&quot;I feel it is high time that someone has led the association,&quot; says a man who is primarily associated with jabloneckým club, but who for years worked in Sparta and Union Executive Committee.
I therefore believe that he has enough experience to be able to manage the Czech football.
He believes that the current problems with the choice of the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hasek.
&quot;Unfortunately, the June general meeting were approved statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought.&quot;
&quot;If they did not permit different interpretations, we had a President since September,&quot; said Pelt.
It is the most important document processing Civic Association took delegates as bait.
&quot;If I become President, I&#39;ll take it as a personal challenge and I am willing to give personal responsibility if they fail.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a matter of principle, without which we can not be,&quot; said Pelt.
Beyond trying not to identify the allegedly against their opponents.
He had announced that you can imagine Rajchl collaboration with Henry, which recognizes právnickému due to his education, and knows that his opponent was his first deputy.
Long did not attack nor Thomas Paclík that contrary to the thread Pelt let dry.
&quot;In football moves over a year, has won some successes.&quot;
&quot;His attacks were disgraceful and a lot of people way the campaign by surprise.&quot;
&quot;That is why many are now doubts about his real character,&quot; said Pelt opponent&#39;s address, which apparently remains faithful proclamations which announced in September.
His strongest weapon is in his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest to the representation.
This should be a showcase for football.
&quot;And I was trying to end all scandals from the Bohemians and the aftermath of scandal corruption scandal last year.&quot;
&quot;Immediately after I threw the negotiations with the private and public sectors, to ensure enough money for the football,&quot; said ČTK šestačtyřicetiletý candidate two months ago.
At that time, vowed that his arrival at the head of football would not involve any personal cleansing.
&quot;I would first meet with the filling of individual employees,&quot; sent a message to Strahov, where a long interregnum, there is understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, believes that the delegates not traveling on Thursday to Nymburk unnecessarily.
&quot;If the only point of contention is how it will vote in the third round, and through it we can bring.&quot;
&quot;Football needs credibility, and the only gains that will finally turn their leader,&quot; Pelt remains perhaps two days before deciding on his career functionaries optimist.
Rajchl promises that underneath the hard work began FAČR
If the new Chairman of Football Association of the Czech Republic in Thursday&#39;s general meeting elected the current Vice-President Henry Rajchl, many people said the association would be pleased.
Rajchl promises that if elected his hard work begins.
He wants to promote systemic change and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football field.
It also promised to resolve the case against the Bohemians, to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, football bring in more money and continue the work begun by the previous chairman Ivan Hasek.
&quot;As President I would like to football as a whole.&quot;
&quot;The international contacts with UEFA and FIFA over representation, professional football, football performance by young people.&quot;
&quot;But that&#39;s not to say that I did everything myself,&quot; he said in an interview Rajchl ČTK.
&quot;I am a team player and I want to split the Executive Committee of competence so that each member gave a certain area.&quot;
&quot;And I will give hard tasks to each segment that kicked a soccer mile step forward.&quot;
&quot;Many people would have done some fun, because it started to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,&quot; he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in a football movement apparently thought that it would not stand again.
&quot;O me to know that I&#39;m doing 20 hours a day.&quot;
&quot;But I need to know that it will make sense and that you will not have people who I will always crimp and questioning my every step,&quot; explained why he hesitated.
&quot;Many people told me but it must not give up, because then it would give up others.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s a confidence that I can not just drop,&quot; he said.
What motivates him and said to continue the work that began with Hasek.
&quot;In those two years did a great job and I do not want to throw away now.&quot;
&quot;They started the process that will need to have a reverberation in a few years, and I do not want to stop someone,&quot; he said with concern that, if elected another candidate Miroslav Pelt, the union said the situation could go back to the front of Hasek.
&quot;I believe in the systematic and it is something that I think Mirek Pelt can not.&quot;
&quot;Behind him are mostly established people who would do football and that was only for the elect.&quot;
&quot;I can read a lot of things, but certainly not that we side with someone.&quot;
&quot;I try to be objective.&quot;
&quot;I want to do football for all, then all will be well and not only the election,&quot; said Rajchl.
Refutes the statement that would be only the Czech president.
&quot;Although some people try to argue to the contrary, I&#39;m planning to do the most for Moravia.&quot;
&quot;For example, it is time to think about that, the second league split into the Czech and Moravian part of the winners would go to the Premier League.&quot;
&quot;Isn would present situation where only three in the league Moravian units, which is a problem toward the young players in Moravia,&quot; said Rajchl.
As the fight joined by President and Chief Thomas Paclík Club Pilsner, dare Rajchl you estimate your chances of being elected.
&quot;Still I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which I chose as his Vice-President and sees that to me is a clear success,&quot; said Rajchl that for his success as saving tens of millions on unfavorable contracts, negotiating television contracts and the negotiation of the lottery the law.
Conversely, given the complicity that the union does not pull together.
While the Pelt claims to be &quot;disqualified from being returned to Czech football confidence&quot;, the second contender Paclík considered a strong candidate that has something to offer football.
&quot;No one can dispute that in Pilsen for that year has done a great job.&quot;

The most beautiful pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
Paddling from the perspective of Aliens, sumptuous swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels Europe, can experience the miracle of its blue - and after visiting the city or traveling let your tired feet a break in the thermal baths.
The book shows where the water is beautiful wellness.
When Iris Meder published in the past one and a half journey in the discovery, in her luggage could not be missed: the swimsuit.
Lying supine on the water, looked up into artistically shaped domes, swam across a marble putti (small figures of a naked boy child (with wings)), which awaited her at the edge of the pool and admire the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pool.
If she liked some of the swimming pool, in an instant it entered in his diary - with notable details on how to build buildings and history.
More than 200 swimming pools in this way explore the historic architecture in Bratislava and is now in its just-released book &quot;Badefreuden (The joy of swimming)&quot;: People swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace swimming pool in the Black Forest, &quot;hard core concrete structures&quot; in the Taunus.
13 countries led by the &quot;Road to nejneobyčejnějšími spa in Central Europe&quot;: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visiting sites in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia .
46-year-old German is a real entuziastkou plovárenské culture.
With the sport&#39;s too exaggerating, says Meder - just water it is something else.
The anger is just that the fans must settle for swimming with blue tiles and odor of chlorine, while the runners to health may inhale intoxicating scent of pine trees and chirping birds to listen to merry in the park.
&quot;One day I asked why swimming pools must be so ugly,&quot; said Mrs. living in Vienna, Bratislava.
&quot;So I started to collect a nice swimming pool.&quot;
Water level architecture doubles
Splashing in the pool and sauna for essential oils - comfort factor is therefore so large that it affects all the senses, so Ms. Meder.
And when the founders tried swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of one floor in the bath water.&quot;
&quot;This is both transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the building.&quot;
Everything visually doubles: high arches, colorful tiles, diving boards.
Small format image bundle &quot;Badefreuden (Joy of swimming)&quot; provides 190 pages of everything you need to know about architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oasis - but also raises desire to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens appeared collector Mrs. Meder swimming pools in their quest in Hungary.
Besides the magnificent medicinal spa, a 100-year-old Széchenyi baths in Budapest, find water containing nitrate in the original karst cave (Cave Bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, swimming pools which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building shaped bottles (Városi Termálfürdő in Jászberény).
Wonderful spectacle, however, offer many heated outdoor swimming pool in Switzerland and Austria. While the man has a rooftop swimming pool of Zurich in the eyes of the whole city, it may be in the outdoor pool spa in St. Anton look at the snow-covered Arlberg - a: The steam bath is a window from which you can monitor the traffic on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most notable design pool spa guests expected in Längenfeld: Aquapark Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed in the Alps.
Of the three open-top pan steam rises in the winter so far, what Ötztal mountains in the background towers to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pools rose sběratelce Ms. Meder smell of chlorine into nostrils.
Many feel the thermal baths of sulfur, in the spa in the Hungarian Árpád Békéscsaba it smells of fuel oil to the extent that one scarcely believe that he was in medical spas.
The smell comes from the healing waters with alkaline bicarbonates, which is almost black, and whose deposits adhere to the skin, once just a man slips into the pool - a rather strange experience wellness.
But the place was also one of Iris Meder in his quest for beautiful spa disappointed: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luhačovice, hit the closed terrain.
In 1902 the architect Dušan Jurkovič designed spa have since been closed.
When Mrs. Meder windows looked crumbling red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, saw the massive weeds growing between the tiles.
Extinction, however, stood in the charming swimming in the Black Forest: at the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas have already had three phases of construction, one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date from its inception in 1844, but also a Moorish-style Alhambra Hall, which was added around 1900.
Since 1995, the careful modernization Palais Thermal popular spa resort pools Chartered Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because it comes from the Black Forest.
&quot;It is a power to combine such diverse architectural styles in such a beautiful complex,&quot; says Ms. Meder.
In such a palace is immersed in a thermal pool probably marginal.
Agrarian speculation
Deutsche Bank, lets examine the trade in commodities
Christian Teevs
Deutsche Bank leaves their trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann appointed a working group to investigate the effects of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the group wants to draw the consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the federal thing is clear: 84% of Germans, according to one study considers it unacceptable that banks speculating in agricultural raw materials such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents even require that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions stood out from this business because it deepens the problems of the poorest of the world.
This is the result Forsa poll on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report by Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, Harald Schumann author shows that betting exchanges in global commodity prices driven out to the height of the bank and therefore complicit in the global problem of hunger.
Conservation Campaign is a consumer directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although velkobanky well as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are acting like.
Originally commodity bets meant to insure against business fluctuations in prices.
In the meantime, but most experts agree that capital market participants with a focus on high-risk businesses to go beyond supply and demand - and on behalf of the poorest achieve profits.
Unlike competitors in the United States responded to the criticism Ackermann: He promised to examine the complaints and said that no business &quot;is not worth it to Deutsche Bank&#39;s reputation at stake given.&quot;
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE International Working Group monitors complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of inspection is to be closed, then the results will be presented to the Board of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation as to thereby be loaded.
In late January the bank officials then want to tell you what will draw the consequences.
At the end could be reduction of trade in commodities or even total rejection.
Ackermann is working on your self image.
The head of the organization Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically, regardless of how banks today harms the common good.&quot;
Whether Ackermann as a top banking lobbyist honor obligations.
&quot;Deutsche Bank has to delete all of your portfolio entries for which are used to bet money on food prices,&quot; said Bode.
&quot;Whether Mr. Ackermann for the people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank.&quot;
Ackermannův preview appears at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the concern boss a few months before his departure from office would like to leave a perfect image.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the boss of the Board other than planned, the supervisory board does not move.
Diversion from the controversial agrarian speculation could improve its image.
And the possible loss need not worry - with the deal would eventually be his successor.
Every second, investment in raw material expelled
Foodwatch strives to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far contributed more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign organization.
On Tuesday, Bode published a poll in which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 persons interviewed.
Just eleven percent depending regarded as legitimate, that Deutsche Bank offers investment, which are associated with betting on food prices.
Many customers of banks would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank accounts at such stores: Every second would result in the polls told all investments in which money is in speculation in raw materials.
43 percent would warn against such well-known bank, 49 percent said they popřemýšlí to terminate your account and go to another institution.
House 21st century in Vienna
Moving pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture, with peaks, falls a happy ending: Austrian Pavilion at the World Exhibition in Brussels 1958 prices gained, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and dilapidated.
Now re-opened for the house as an exhibition.
When the mountain of postwar modern architecture, to form a clear, glass halls, daring booms and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzera pavilion for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 and famously concise example.
Schwanzerův pavilion had received the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture for his light and graceful acting construction of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a milestone of modern architecture.
Famous architect, so that also for the next World&#39;s Fair pavilion built in Austria.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace made plus side as the key building in Munich, eventually became famous internationally in 1973.
Its construction as a temporary exhibition pavilion designed by the World Exhibition located in Vienna at the Schweizer Garten Südbahnhof (South Station), reconstructed in 1962 the Museum opened the 20th century - was named as the &quot;House of the 20th century.&quot;
Suitable for the museum building but was not technically or spatially - missing wall for hanging art exhibits, a suitable climate.
Yet was used until the forthcoming contemporary art in Vienna a new stand.
From 2001 the building was empty and deteriorated more and more.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz reconstructed pavilion, now bears the name &quot;House of the 21st century&quot; and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening there opens the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace is the first exhibition - a happy plan in every respect.
It has been recognized a new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, which in 2007 became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate art historian with a distinguished career, among other things, figure skater in her youth, and later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, reconstruction strongly pushed by politicians and conservationists, sought public funding and private sponsorship money and designated uses.
In addition to contemporary art should be exhibited sculptor Fritz Foundation Wotruby same name, it should arise cafe and bookstore, and had to be built to an office building.
Strict supervision, low budget.
The design was then Krischanitz ideal cast.
Not only that sensitively refurbished and expanded the building by Joseph Olbrich Art Nouveau in Vienna and won the competition, but because of Schwanzera studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him &quot;an extremely important place&quot; in which he &quot;almost every weekend,&quot; viewed the exhibition.
He knew the primordial project and knew the problems of building that is in their relocation to Vienna and change of use has lost its generosity and lightness.
During the recent reconstruction were far greater problems: The building was a &quot;catapult for energy,&quot; says Krischanitz.
Profiles of the facade glass windows were replaced, used glass fiber reinforced glass and insulating glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold-steel girder bridges were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings redeveloped.
Two underground floors provide space for new uses, recessed lighting channel between the building and street lighting caters to the entrance bridge leads - almost new building, but still magnificent Schwanzerův pavilion.
The original entrance doors have been preserved, the building is painted in the old anti-rust colored reddish tone.
A cinema is even exactly the same as that used to be before.
And all under strict supervision Heritage Office and the low budget.
&quot;I often had to be found material that is good and cheap and also appealed to památkovému office,&quot; says Krischanitz and highlights broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction of the building remained flexible and airy.
Difficult it was apparently with the pavilion, &quot;which arrived here from Brussels,&quot; he said recently Krischanitz, a typical &quot;Drop-in-the-City-history.&quot;
Such an architecture is said to &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and still wants to &quot;give adequate confidence.&quot;
In this case, but not House 21st inappropriate place for centuries, as happened to urban fluke: In the circle around Schweizer Garten creates a completely new designed &quot;Urban district near the main railway station&quot; with office and residential buildings.
And perhaps there is another happy coincidence: House 21st century could receive support from another building Krischanitzovy as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought Berliner Temporary Kunsthalle and what is heard, it is a city of neighborhoods in the habitat in the Schweizer Garten.
The track plans to pack for winter crisis in millions of
Track vypiplala emergency plan to prevent disruptions of train in winter.
Employees should be doubled.
It will cost millions.
In the fight against outages caused by winter trains and delays Deutsche Bahn issued this year, according to newspaper reports more than 70 million euros.
The newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; brought a preliminary report, citing an internal plan of the concern that apparently counts in 2015 with a total investment of around 300 million euros.
With him is said to be achieved by better use of trains and rail networks as well as extreme weather conditions.
Planned is said among other things, doubling the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people for snow removal on railway station platforms and devices.
The aim should be to get rid of the platform to launch a 90 percent turnout required for operation within four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, warned the head of Rüdiger Grube tracks after a summit meeting with representatives from government and industry failures and train delays also during this winter.
Last winter was run in passenger transport considerable problems, because among other things, under difficult weather conditions had a shortage of reserves.
So expect plenty of new regional trains for years on approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition to this delay in dispatching approaches ICE trains
The track has for years also can not cope with the ICE train axles must evidently have more shop to check if there was one train ICE to Cologne main station to the destruction of the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays million dollar fine in the U.S.
After the commotion around the chief Josef Ackermann is the new trampotám in the U.S.: Deutsche Bank, there has to pay million-dollar damages.
As if you did not have problems at home enough to Deutsche Bank, caught up with the giant in the field have his past in the U.S.: Frankfurt in one institution for settlement proceedings 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes because of bankruptcy five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage certificates.
NCUA financial market regulator accused a number of large banks, cooperative banks that fought to buy the false promises of financial products that reduce the risk around.
Such securities have lost during the crisis largely on the value and demolished the bank with him into the abyss.
&quot;We are satisfied that we could resolve the issue without the need to drag the court,&quot; said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
Bank settlement does not confer any guilt.
This is also true for Citigroup, which has undertaken to pay 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the willingness of both financial institutions.
National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for co-operative banks in the U.S. and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer assets.
NCUA is attempting to obtain compensation for any damage in the billions.
Settlement are now finished the first of its kind.
The controller is also fastened to the other in summer velkobanky sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The dubious mortgage-sheet is the so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble about burst in 2007, it happened a number of financial firms fatal.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis changed the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers their thinking.
Although the events took place several years ago, now blows the banks to meet strong wind.
Investors and supervisory authorities filed numerous actions to reach the affected axle or misconduct.
Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
International complains that the 18 velkobankám that two U.S. government engaged in real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when dealing with mortgages worth about $ 200 billion disadvantage.
Deutsche Bank also faces action FHFA, here is the more stores totaling about $ 14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
Dohlédací Authority requires that the Frankfurt Institute was responsible for &quot;substantial losses&quot;, but said without an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the demands as unfounded and stated that he wants to defend.
Warren Buffett with 10 billion enter into the IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in IT company IBM.
Since March bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the American investor Warren Buffett has always claimed to be in IT and computers, to invest, because the long-term development of companies leaving only difficult to predict.
But now read the business news IBM and its opinion on investment in the industry changed.
Much earlier had to understand that IBM offers mainly services and purchases of computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett&#39;s investment in the financial world is considered to be knighted.
Consequently, the parent rock may call IBM IT now &quot;IBM Sir.&quot;
For Buffett told the American Economic radio station CNBC that from March bought shares of IBM worth $ 10.7 billion.
Investmentholding His Berkshire Hathaway has become one of the largest shareholders with a share of IBM&#39;s 5.5 percent.
Buffett sagt that even IBM has nothing of his involvement did not know.
He praised the management, who tried for the economic crisis as much as ordinary income.
&quot;You did a great job,&quot; said Buffett to the strategy.
IBM is betting has long been a lucrative IT services such as operation of computer centers.
More than 100-year-old pioneer of computer software and also offers consulting and executive for a computer company.
Buffett technology companies to this day rather avoid.
They argue that invests only in companies whose activities are also understood.
Instead, Buffett reached for freight rail, lubricant manufacturers or OEMs.
Holding his Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 in addition to its own subsidiary companies also share in a number velkokoncernů as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Ruck.
81-year-old man took the 60-ies of last century, a small textile firm Berkshire Hathaway and built it a wise investment of the most valuable companies in the world.
Despite its modest way of life.
Therefore, for many investors worldwide cult figure.
Its almost infallible sense for making money, brought him the nickname &quot;Orakel from Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha.&quot;
When Buffett&#39;s investment became known, IBM shares rose before the exchange of one percent.
&quot;Big Blue&quot; as IBM called, has a total price of the stock market more than $ 220 billion and is considered along with Apple and Microsoft as the most valuable technology companies of the world.
The company Microsoft, so Buffett, but would not want to get on.
Founder Bill Gates is said to be his intimate friend.
Threat is palpable
Following the discovery of &quot;The cells in Zwickau,&quot; doubts about the German media Turkish rule of law.
Newspapers even speaks of &quot;the bloody ideology,&quot; which now comes to life again.
The murders of eight small entrepreneurs of Turkish origin and one Greek from 2000 to 2006, there were right-wing extremist background.
This message is in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and worry.
Because for many German Turks back the specter that has long been considered dead: From arson in Mölln in November 1992 and in the Solingen in May 1993 there was no comparable right-wing extremist violence in the background.
That in Germany there are about xenophobia but never in doubt.
Discovered a network of right-wing extremist but reveals the extent to which the dimension can not have long to see.
&quot;Bloody ideology alive again?&quot; sounded subtitles web edition of Turkish newspaper &quot;Haberturk&quot;.
The newspaper &quot;Sabah&quot; by contrast, emphasize that one of the perpetrators should be a secret police agent of the Department for Protection of the Constitution and the fear that the German authorities could be implicated in the radical right-wing swamps.
The Turkish community has reacted calmly Germany: Remembering the weekend of demonstrations against Brandenburg Gate silence victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago reminded Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish policies solemn act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish agreement on recruitment.
The bright colors were staged life together - as a history of success.
As boxes are works of several Turkish news media: &quot;A gift to the fiftieth Germany&quot; is the title of the article in the Turkish internet platform &quot;Haber X,&quot; which reports on a series of murderous background.
Also issue of newspaper &quot;Hürriyet&quot; for Germany can not be taken to transpose the mental connection.
&quot;It&#39;s starting to stink,&quot; reads the caption post by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people have been murdered, who paid their taxes and their work brought an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Most critical is discussed in Internet forums německotureckých police procedure and its success in the late hunt.
Why not think the German authorities much earlier, after searching the suspected right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many shows at least rhetorically ready to use drastic means: &quot;If there continue to conduct business so superficially, left with nothing but immigrants own defense and weaponry.&quot;
&quot;It will be perhaps the best self-defense.&quot;
&quot;The quality and adequacy of punishment clarification of the whole network depends strongly on inner peace in Germany,&quot; he writes, &quot;Selenium&quot;.
What does it mean if inner peace is threatened in Germany, explaining Mölln and assassinations in Solingen in the nineties.
Photos burned in Solingen is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For any other event showed clearly the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat to the Germans and the lack of trust and detachment can result in right-wing violence
However, attacks on the Turks made evident sense of reciprocity.
Do not repeat past mistakes
The Turkish press has been criticized, the main failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to those in Mölln survivors visit.
After the arson attack in Solingen sent a condolence telegram to the President of the Turkish state, but let the funeral ceremony in Cologne represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in a speech then calculate what fees the local Turks return their.
Quite as if the value measured by the height of a person&#39;s taxes.
Contemporary Turkish news media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in local polities.
In addition to extensive efforts to clarify and evaluate new extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany this time requires open words.
Scandal at the bank of Lake Zurich
Europe&#39;s most adventurous bank is not established in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered a financial crisis nearly bankrupt, and since then glides from one crisis to another.
Now it has a German comparison.
So it certainly did not think Axel Weber.
After his noisy departure from the front lines of the Federal Bank became known in July, 2013 to the board almost as spectacular new job: President of the Board velkobanky Swiss UBS - an unexpected step in and lucrative career.
Axel Weber was looking forward publicly, whether praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound respectability and said a friendly note to future colleagues.
&quot;Die UBS achieved a turnover.&quot;
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübelem&quot;.
But in September it was clear that everything will turn out differently.
One dealer from UBS in London, all safety systems bypassed the banks and approximately 1.7 billion euros zmarnil.
UBS chief Oswald Grübel board, not just in Switzerland recognized banker, had to leave.
President of the UBS Board of Directors has since been scalded as well - and we all ask: When Axel Weber finally comes?
It became known that Weber from the bank in February 2012 may advise.
A assumes the chairmanship in May - not only in 2013 as Bank on Tuesday communicate.
For Axel Weber, it will be hard.
There is no banker, but rather a professor of economics and emission banker and she would need time to incorporate.
Then suddenly assumes responsibility for the bank&#39;s strategy, which was once again proved that it deserves the title &quot;Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe&quot;
Because UBS is a giant - until recently was the largest asset manager in the world - both slides and for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing as it seems, left the Swiss bank proud spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
UBS until 2007 enjoyed an excellent reputation.
Image silent and solid, but also astute trustee is combined with ambitious goals: I mean something in investment banking.
So UBS 2007 to manage the one hand, with 1.6 trillion dollars more money to wealthy clients than any other bank of the world.
On the other hand, an investment bank advanced to the league of the world&#39;s largest banks
It made an impression.
Former banker and later a long-time professor of banking at Zurich Hans Geiger says: &quot;I had my students UBS has always featured as a model of good banks.&quot;
&quot;In retrospect, one wonders: How could I have just been so wrong?&quot;
Greatly mistaken.
In 2007, the first obvious that something went wrong at UBS properly.
In mid surprisingly resigned chief of the Board Peter Wuffli, who was still regarded as highly intelligent as well as brilliant banker.
A few months later he had suspected why he left.
The investment bank division Subprime-wasted paper and had to write off billions.
In order to stabilize, UBS announced by a capital increase amounting to 13 billion francs really.
But really find investors, but those over which they have recently nose curling manner: Opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one does not learn his name.
But it was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the Board Marcel Ospel, 2006 a second best-paid Board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by disaster: UBS was due to their faulty investments on the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
Nationalbank purchased from UBS tens of billions of questionable securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds, for which he could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole was shaken Switzerland - as noticed as dramatic for a small country, when their territory is so large banks.
After all, UBS balance sheet total was 2007 more than five times bigger than Switzerland&#39;s economic performance (see figure).
&quot;Once again we were unable to rescue UBS,&quot; said banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster follows another.
For several months, surrendered to UBS in a tax dispute with America, and expressed willingness to release data affluent customers if possible for banks to help while away the tax.
In addition to the agreed payment of $ 780 million - as the recovery of undue profits from these transactions, including penalty surcharges.
This UBS has undergone more or less openly, to assist tax evasion.
At the same time losing something that was always the capital to compete for rich clients: halo discretion.
After this scandal has been the Swiss banking secrecy what earlier.
This was followed by the resignation of the chief of the Board and President of the Board.
A customer exodus of money.
So the bank has lost over several months, your credibility in both the central business areas: investment banking for the poor and speculation in asset management for the facilitation of tax evasion.
And just when it calmed down a bit, just as it was thought that UBS is again recovered, here comes this unhappy business adventure: The only dealer zmarnil 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something is wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, it still seems wrong.
&quot;The case is about Adoboli found that the control of risks has changed very little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance Finanz Banking Institute at Zurich University.
Also, Chief Financial Officer large German bank is sure: &quot;The problem is that UBS, the control can not cope with risks.&quot;
However, it was exactly she did the idea of ​​prudence with which Swiss bankers stepped out long ago to become watchdogs of large estates of the world: no undue risks, but security for the money - even on this side of the Alpine republic collapsed world again.
Safes Swiss banks have become a symbol for unshakable reliability Lindt and Sprüngli chocolate for extra quality.
UBS headquarters in Zurich, still fits the cliché of good Swiss private banks - is only slightly larger.
It is a classic location.
The Bank is headquartered in Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, is framed by snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry such as Tiffany&#39;s, the Swiss will find traditional shops such as confectioner Sprüngli.
For centuries, it houses the Swiss banks: from the Nationalbank via the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The reception hall is entered by UBS heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are lined with marble, they face a huge leather chair, next to the logo signs to large banks &#39;safe&#39;.
UBS knows what customers are looking for: safety.
This idea of ​​the two Swiss banks Swiss velkobanky, UBS and Credit Suisse but sometimes - or betrayed suppressed, finds as chief of a small Swiss private bank.
His name would rather not want to read in the newspapers, finally concludes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both velkobankami shops.
UBS is probably not increased, the checks - especially in investment banking, where he also expanded the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss are not about to have something to say.
&quot;And if they did, long ago adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways.&quot;
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS has changed, it brought about high profits initially and then disaster: No European financial institution lost in the jungle around as much money as Subprime Großbank Schweizer.
15th October 2008 disaster was obvious.
&quot;At that concluded Wednesday, the coalition government sedmimilionové small country in the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation,&quot; writes Lukas Hässig in his book &quot;Der UBS-Crash&quot;.
Up to 68 billion francs, or approximately € 45 billion approved by politicians to save from bankruptcy velkobanku standing.
How could this happen?
If the talks with Swiss bankers, so they see a problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998 he joined two of the three Swiss velkobank into a massive conglomerate.
Bank was established that the merger was already too large to small Switzerland - and still continued to grow.
At the same time conducive to the two different bank UBS predecessor complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and poorer, but more strongly engaged internationally.
Suddenly came internationalized investment bankers favorably to many money with which to spin the big wheel.
With the rise of UBS are linked two names: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 group chief Marcel Ospel and UBS, then Chairman of the Board.
&quot;I always thought that Ospel and Wuffli are a team of the future,&quot; said banking expert Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest, who knows much about the models and statistics and Ospel, the person managing the feelings around the stomach, which has been fully developed science bank up.&quot;
But Ospel said in the end relied on Wuffliho.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a critical error: &quot;I thought that its models are a reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;This is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
This much is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees can clearly remember the meetings of managers, the chief of the concern which Wuffli repeated again and again the same password: Goldman Sachs knock down from the throne.
U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank world.
Stated &quot;League Tables&quot; waiting list, which documents the success of banks at that time.
In it, she tried to UBS on the location at the top.
A few steps she had succeeded.
The trade in foreign exchange and equity attended games at the top.
Business advisers, who were charged, however, highlight one weakness: The interest rate international trade, bankers in a speech &quot;Fixed Income&quot;, perhaps there is a large gap for the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in the American mortgage products.

Also, the criticism was the noise made by birds Jürgens Ms own view: &quot;This is about the volume of each communication, you have much to say.&quot;
Animal intelligence and skill are legendary: Ravens field devices used not only to achieve a snack, but even as his instrument makes a tool.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently tested the behavior of the four rook as far reaching intelligence of birds.

The massacre on a personal level
Emotionally powerful new book by Peter Englund called Beauty and grief: Inside History of the First World War (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War) begins with a long list of performers and characters, and it makes you dizzy.
One council, as at that moment to keep: Carefully rip this page and make it a bookmark.
All persons in the novel is the story of Mr. Englund very well acquainted, and this list will serve as navigation - as a kind of beacon - in the moments when, like the men and women in the story will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
It is also deputy to the new Swedish Academy that awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
The book, which is talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as &quot;antihistorickou work&quot;.
It contains some very familiar names, major contracts or famous battles, while it is almost no ambassadors, journalists and vigorous debate about tactics and equipment.
It&#39;s not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, but rather &quot;a book about what it was.&quot; It deals mainly about &quot;feelings, perceptions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; combines the experience of war more or less 20 dozen men and women on both sides of the barricades, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, drivers and officials záchranek.
Some of these people become heroes.
Others have become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad or die with.
Their lives are like flames flickering candles lit in the church - new are added to the patchwork of lives, while others uhasínají.
Mr. Englund&#39;s book is the classic historical novels differ.
Adjusts the idea that the First World War was just a horrific trench battles on the Western Front.
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; skillfully explores other places, where a war dramas: the Alps, the Balkans, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book addresses the problems that they fall bee nests, to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or are faced with the presence of tsetse flies.
Almost from the beginning is a very moving reading.
The war engulfed the lives of people as a natural disaster such as Hurricane Katrina smelling gunpowder.
When the distance starts to hear shooting from the works and you are a woman who is at home with my children, flee or stay?
Who is it actually coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, or even why a war was unleashed.
&quot;The vacuum resulting from the lack of facts,&quot; noted Mr. Englund, &quot;was filled with speculation, assumptions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.&quot;
&quot;The beauty and sorrow&quot; follows the stories of individuals, such as Farmboroughová Florence, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are mostly taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
Descriptions of their lives may sound scary and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details are absolutely alive and believable.
Many of them deals with the suffering and coping with it.
In the story of German student author says: &quot;Substitutes, substitutes the same everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Coffee substitutes, imitation aluminum, artificial rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons.&quot;
Goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It talks about &quot;meat made of pressed rice cooked in mutton fat (and bone, accompanied by fake wood), dried roots of tobacco and dried potato peelings, shoes with wooden soles.&quot;
He mentions that there were &quot;837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes.&quot;
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American in itself the internal impulses of savagery and brutality of war and then declares: &quot;Finally, understand that this is just human nature. Not sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, evening newspaper or good book and pretend this your mask represents civilization and that the stiffness for me hiding inside any barbarian. &quot;
On the contrary, a British soldier realizes that most likely die soon and no one even noticed, let alone to mourn.
&quot;When one finally reconciled with the fact that the sacrifices, he would at least that happens in front of a grateful audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, however, feels like &quot;a convict, who secretly hangs.&quot;
Other comments regarding the departure of old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
&quot;The conflict is becoming increasingly competitive economic competition and struggle,&quot; writes Mr. Englund, &quot;war between the factories.&quot;
He caught what he calls &quot;a new kind of beast emerging century: articulate and avowed ideological mass murderer of tailored clothing, which made its bloodshed, without rising from the table.&quot;
People behave quite unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers from prostitutes who are deliberately trying to catch a venereal disease in order to avoid service in the queue.
&quot;Nejgrotesknějším example of this behavior was trading gonokokovým pus that troops were buying it and spred the genitals, hoping to end up in hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;The most desperate and rubbed it in the eye, which is often blinded until the end of life.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund&#39;s prose is brisk, but not ostentatious, which is subject to its human ideal.
In dozens of small output shows how war &quot;unleashed a completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.
People are beginning to ask why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the First World War rather than with the most comprehensive narrative work with signs such as &quot;The First World War and modern memory&quot; by Paul Fussell, or novels like &quot;The peace of the Western Front&quot; by Erich Maria Remarquea.
Mr. Englund prefers unconventional concept.
His book has the most devastating endings, which in non-fiction literature is unparalleled.
But it will not reveal.
You will not feel as if the author suddenly jumped from a book, you tore a page from the list of heroes of the hand and lit it.

The orders to move to the park came literally &quot;at the last minute,&quot; said someone who was originally explained by the action only as &quot;exercise&quot;.
&quot;I know a few police officers who were in this action are called, and most certainly no one said that going to Zuccotti Park,&quot; said the person, who spoke only on condition that they remain anonymous.
&quot;The fact that they are going to Zuccotti Park, knew only the most prominent members of the department.&quot;
One reason for secrecy was the lesson that the town had once received.
14th October had city officials plan to clean up the park, but then withdrew from the plan as soon as he heard protesters flocked to them before starting the operation of the park across hundreds.
Tuesday&#39;s event was attended by officers from various units, including response teams from all around - dozens of police officers who are commonly utilized to enhance neighborhoods with higher crime rates.
Mr. Kelly explained that the park during the day comes and goes a lot of people, so one hour at night was an ideal time when the action started.
&quot;It should do this at a time when the park will be as little people,&quot; he said.
Before the drive started out, lined the streets on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Bridge Manhattan Bridge, emergency unit trucks with loudspeakers and arc lamps.
Lights and recorded message from loudspeakers roaring frightened many protesters.
When they entered the park police, members of the units in their blue větrovkách, many protesters have packed their things and left.
The police say that up until 1:45 in the morning with a single touch the tent, which the demonstrators wanted to give time to pack things.
Other police teams were seen to gather on the edge of the park that could penetrate into it, if it was necessary to make any arrests.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Main Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said that this was for their safety.
Many journalists, however, believes that the police wanted to prevent them from making the unit saw action in addition to them some of the police behaved rudely.
Mr. Browne said that the TV cars on Church Street running along the western boundary of the park to smoothly rotate.
Police proceeded westward and weaving a dense tangle of personal belongings of protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes. Behind them the teams left the hygiene department, which immediately shrabovaly everything left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move, were dragged out of the park. Visual materials documenting the moment, then appeared on the Internet.
Hardcore group of protesters resorted to in the kitchen near their camp, which lay near the center of the park.
Some created a roadblock and the police began their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp chained to each other.
And two people tied to a tree, said Mr. Kelly.
They were members of the emergency services called to cut the locks.
Until 3:30 in the morning in the park there was no arrests, said Mr. Kelly.
The whole operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police statement sounded.
Mr. Browne said that the park was detained around 142 people.
Most of the arrests took place because of the &quot;organization of riots and resisting arrest,&quot; he clarified.
Most senior police officer in place of the event was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation is also personally involved in Phil T. Pulaski, commander of detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but &quot;not involved in the management of operations,&quot; said Mr. Browne.
The second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and the streets of Cedar Street, in the event that would need to need to call it.
On the Street Cortlandt Street, a block north of Park Street and Pine Street, a block south of the park, barricades were erected.
From these places the police developed further buffer from Zuccotti Park.
At one point the police were seen, many of which were equipped with shields to push people even further behind the frontier.
The northern border was about 28 persons.
Wildest Night event took place south of the park.
Around five o&#39;clock in the morning, a protester was spotted south of Pine Street, both jumped on the hood of a police car and several others who let out the air from the police van tires.
At one point the crowd flipped a piece of plywood.
At the end of the operation was hospitalized one policeman and one protester.
Trade union support staff will be suing the city for release
Trade unions representing hundreds of school support staff, who last month lost their jobs, on Wednesday plans to sue the city. They argue that dismissal was not necessary and moreover for discrimination due to the disproportionate impact of schools attended by poor students.
Litigation is probably the last option that unions in the area of ​​District Council 37 is left, in their efforts to reverse the decision on dismissal.
Seventh lost their jobs in October six hundred seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other staff, who were among the lowest paid city employees. Their dismissal of union members have described the town in retaliation for that last spring he did not allow access to health care fund managed work crews, through which the city wanted to clog the hole in the budget.
City officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At the hearing the City Council, held last month, said Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott, the redundancies were part of the budget approved in June.
One of the council members immediately countered by the fact that nowhere in the budget and specifically talked about the release of extra workers.
Representatives District 37 District Council announced that it has already filled the necessary documents and the Ministry of Education warned that it will sue. On Wednesday convened a press conference where he formally notify the action at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
Defendants in the process, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight redundancies, all of whom are African-Americans or Hispanics, like most other assistants, who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city Law Department, said the city still has not seen action, and therefore will not charge for individual expression.
According to the draft complaint, which was able to obtain New York Times, the union focused on the amount released in the poor parts of the city, which wanted to support his claim of unfair conduct. Hold the view is that poor schools have lost more assistants, because they have long been denied adequate funding.
They point out that while the schools in Staten Island, and even shedding of the Upper East Side only minimally, in Brooklyn, part of District 23 in Brownsville have lost their jobs 17 school assistants and parts of District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx was released even 46 assistants.
Recalls that at school Public School 36 in Harlem lost their jobs, five of eight assistants, though terms of school, where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: &quot;This is not a neighborhood full of movable parents who can procure funds to offset the deficit in the budget.&quot;
Budget Public School 36 school year was reduced by 3.26 percent and the school also lost money when the city changed the method of calculating the bonus funding for each logged a poor student.
Unions argues, inter alia, that the directors of secondary schools could be confused with the manner in which it was written document authorizing release of parenting coordinators.
The document was used to describe the action word &quot;excess&quot; that is, abolish the position, although the word is more often used to describe the movement of teachers from the payroll database available to school employees whose salary is paid by the central authority.
&quot;Sixty-six parenting coordinators have been released,&quot; the draft complaint, &quot;and not only moved into the database available for the position of workers.&quot;
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept a settlement of the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something that concerns the rebellion in Libya.
Before that, however, had a revolution to succeed, long ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of units of the United States ended.
On Tuesday, the Commission for International Relations of the Senate to decide on the statement, which supports Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), which should congratulate the Libyans to their successful rebellion and thank U.S. troops for &quot;bravery&quot;.
&quot;With this statement we want to appreciate the courage of the population of Libya, who began the reconstruction of their country,&quot; said Kerry.
&quot;Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic aspirations.&quot;
These phrases may look innocent, but no debate, concerning Libya, and has not been easy.
During the summer, lawmakers from both parties constantly argued among themselves and with the White House as a series of statements to the contrary, approval or rejection of the United States military role in NATO&#39;s mission in Libya.
In June, McCain and Kerry introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House due to differing views of both political parties, making it on the Senate never voted on.
But the same day it was in the House rejected this proposal, the Chamber also rejected measures that would stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
This U.S. mission in Libya found themselves literally in the legislative purgatory - Congress has criticized the way President Obama manages the mission, but its members obviously upset enough to put him in his actions to stop support.
Reluctance of Congress finally overtook other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and 20 October was killed by Gaddafi.
NATO&#39;s mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
Commission for International Relations in a statement &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and admirable tenacity, he spent in an effort to liberate his people&quot; and &quot;commends the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States and its allies, who participated in operations to protect the Libyan population for outstanding bravery and professionalism. &quot;
The declaration also &quot;confirmed the United States national interest in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.&quot;
Gets a new proposal for full support of the Commission for International Relations, or lawmakers will again be divided into two halves, as it was in the approval of the June draft?
The last version stood Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the main representative of the Republican Party committee.
Lugarův spokesman said on Monday that the final version of the new design yet seen.
In the House this week will vote on a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget, which should be a top legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlattem (Va.), the first amendment to the Constitution relating to the budget or any other topic, which will vote on a House or Senate.
Other legislators have not even over considerable efforts have not been able to push through their proposals for voting.
Goodlattův proposal is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that were introduced in Congress and touch a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted by the House and Senate - and others are just slight variations of others.
Only the House can be found at least 15 versions of the amendment on the balanced budget and a handful of others that would like to &quot;regulate federal spending.&quot;
Some of the proposals are indeed identical, but their supporters - especially starting with the Republicans, who want to improve reputation - can be proud of their &quot;authorship.&quot;
The yield on the regulation of the budget that was approved in August, would require the amendment relating to a balanced budget, the House and Senate voted.
At March 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget of several members wanted to discuss the limitations of the period in which members of Congress could serve as José E. Serrano (NY) wants to increase the number of periods, which may be as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of amendments that would, inter alia, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
Remains constant draft amendment banning same-sex couples marriage amendment banning and burning of the national flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the nullification of federal laws in the case against them build two thirds of the States.
Although it appears that members of Congress are proposing various amendments in the very active, compared with previous years, but not significantly deviate greatly from the average.
The 111th Congress offered 77 amendments, while the 100th 66th Congress were
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 90 the 20 century when, according to statistics offered Senate library members every two years, more than 150 amendments.
But they were much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - 27 Appendix - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was designed by Congress in 1789.
&quot;Beaten but not defeated,&quot; Gifford says in his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after her from the immediate vicinity of the injured gunner in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, with Gabrielle Gifffordsová (Ariz.) on Monday evening appeared on national television, he sang along with tunes from the Broadway show &quot;The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow&quot; and said that more than a return to Congress is to make the whole.
Giffordsová appeared on the show &quot;20/20&quot; on ABC News with Diane Sawyer. It was seen that the formation of sentences makes her even more problems and needed help walking.
The whole program documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to injury caused by a bullet that pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain and came back out of your head.
Three months ago, surprisingly returned to the House to vote on triumphantly took the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, during which six people were killed and another 13 were injured, with Giffordsová smiled, laughed and sang - and my recovery has described as &quot;difficult.&quot;
When Sawyer asked her how he feels, jednačtyřicetiletá Giffordsová said: &quot;Quite well.&quot;
Interview with Giffordsovou and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the work-hour special program &quot;20/20&quot; which was aired on the eve of release of a new book this couple, called &quot;Gabby: A story of courage and hope.&quot;
Special Gifford followed the recovery of the firing of 8 January.
The videos that made Kelly during the first week, you can see Giffordsová in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar across his forehead.
While she encourages her husband, unable at that time more than just pick up one or two fingers.
A few months later Giffordsová captured, sitting in a wheelchair and her therapists learn how to perform simple activities.
Pokývání head.
Vyšpulení lips.
And then, her first word: &quot;What.&quot;
Within a few days Giffordsová spoke another word - &quot;toast&quot; when he demanded changes in their breakfast.
Video broadcast by ABC show that the pivotal role played Giffordsové recovery for music: Congresswoman to sing them together with a therapist to tune to the songs &quot;Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&quot; by Cyndi Lauperové and &quot;Free Fallin &#39;&quot; by Tom Petty.
During the interview Gifford, who devotes two hours daily therapy, told Sawyer that she dated when the shooting occurred, nothing can remember.
Her husband said that Gifford read newspaper articles about the shooting to 12 March, when she first asked who she was six, who was killed in an incident.
The shooting suspect is Jared Lee Loughner, which is being held in jail in Missouri, where under the influence of drugs forcibly administered awaiting trial.
&quot;Many people died,&quot; said Sawyer Giffordsová.
&quot;Terrible, terrible, terrible.&quot;
Kelly told Sawyer that at one point during his convalescence wife said: &quot;I lost.&quot;
&quot;So I just told her: Gabby, neprohrálas,&quot; described Kelly.
&quot;You just got beaten.
But you can do it, and put it together and come back even stronger than ever. &quot;
Military units are confronted with compassion rather than with respect
The event was a gala evening on Wall Street, which earned millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who do not have a roof over their head.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
It happened around him hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.
Festively dressed crowd stood and applauded enthusiastically.
&quot;Men and women serving in the army were regarded as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the benefici spring.
Gala evening was attended by the then Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition it has been in place and Admiral Mike Mullen, who had seen the role of military forces rather differently.
&quot;They were introduced as some orphans,&quot; wrote an officer in the e-mail.
I&#39;m sure that the organizers meant well.
I think so.
But what I saw, not respect. It was a pity.
So just exactly the opposite impression illustrate the uneasy relationship between the military and often aloof, sometimes celebrating the American public.
The army is bezbřeze included praise for his victims.
But this praise is worth something, say soldiers.
The public is increasingly behaving as if the individuals in uniform regretted.
&quot;We&#39;re not victims,&quot; ​​said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon leave.
&quot;But it seems that the only way some of us can support is built into the role of us unfortunate souls.&quot;
This topic is very sensitive to army commanders who do not want to seem ungrateful or spoiled relations with the public they serve.
Also realize that anger, which had to face once the unit returning from Vietnam, was much worse.
The result is that most words of pity is uttered quietly and privately among war veterans.
When two sons of a retired Colonel Mark Canciana returning from combat operations, serving as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that their service to people outside the military will look from two angles.
From the perspective of some will feel respect and awe, because the defeated enemy insurgents and visit exotic places.
Another but will wonder if the &quot;evil hiding beneath the surface, violent veteran,&quot; said Cancian, who participated in the fighting in Iraq and on his return took place in Washington in the government.
He claimed that he was looking for a job, some people who do interviews with him, quietly suggested that so soon after returning to the fight can withstand the stress that is associated with work in Washington.
&quot;When you talk about your service, you must expect negative reactions,&quot; he instructed his sons Cancian.
The concern stems from the army of American indifference to the wars.
Success on the battlefield rarely reap recognition in a country that has a private army, and little awareness in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is only a few own benefit.
&quot;As a nation, have military heroism for granted as they used to be common during the Second World War,&quot; said Lieutenant General David Barna, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public focus mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are distinguished for the number of events, which suffered through, a number of friends they lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The Army is facing increasing pressure not to hit hard against rape
This week will decide whether to start trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If they are not prepared to take action hundreds of other applicants.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was at night when she was allegedly raped by a colleague from the Army, 25 years and was in the 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008, she headed for the barracks at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with my friend ran into her male colleague carrying a box with 12 beers.
He asked her if she can connect to it, that if he alone could drink a bit.
&quot;In my mind flashed a warning light,&quot; described Lyman.
But the native Texan&#39;s objections completely ignored.
I thought: No, he is 19th
&quot;He&#39;s from Texas,&quot; she said.
&quot;I wish I listened to my instincts.&quot;
They argue that only a few minutes after they went into her room, walked over to her husband, threw her on the bed and raped.
This week, 18 November, the Lyman and 27 other current or former military members wait for the verdict hearing that could have historic implications. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will go on whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, he gets to court.
The indictment states that Rumsfeld and Gates failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February, Washington&#39;s lawyer Susan Burke and the plaintiff at the time had 17 members. During the following months, however, their number has grown to 28 to 25 women and three men, who all claim they were raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the army and the army after the announcement of these picks have failed in the investigation and punishment of any quest for justice.
Burke argues that the neck is the most senior commanders of the army, because the problem starts right at them.
&quot;The army&#39;s directive system,&quot; he says.
&quot;Who are the people who are in a position that they can avoid trying to introduce measures against such acts? High Command.&quot;
Burke also contends that since February contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of them could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouped all the allegations in this case - piled all your eggs in one basket, as she says - an action in several different cases, if necessary, the pressure was not relieved.
Ministry of Defence team defending the prosecutor leading the United States Neil MacBride, who along with his colleagues to reject the initiative of the case.
Court documents obtained by Newsweek, discuss in detail the defense strategy - in essence the point is that current or former army soldiers can not sue for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to the Regulation of the Supreme Court in 1950 called the Feres Doctrine as the federal government is not liable for injuries sustained by soldiers in active service.
&quot;The alleged injury to the plaintiffs concerning military service,&quot; says the document.
Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this matter.
Things have not changed since the fifties.
Although women are still not officially serve in combat, it is just a quibble: in modern wars, it is difficult to find clear given front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers teams played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communication with civilian women occurring in a war zone.
Result: the wars between the 150 soldiers killed female - two thirds of them in battle.
It&#39;s time to upgrade, it was in the army, says Burke.
In their fight is not alone. In addition to her with the case involved three other attorneys.
At Yale Law School Visits veteran preparing a seminar on legal services action on four main military academy for alleged development atmosphere that promotes hatred towards women.
Regardless of the non-profit organization of American Vietnam veterans gather evidence for its action directed against the army. This action focuses on the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; which was allegedly found in rape victims to have the army an excuse for their release - according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwatiová belonging to a group of human rights activists Service Women&#39;s Action Network, is a completely routine practice.
Her group in December filed for actions against the state organization for dealing with veterans, he accuses of discriminatory practices, which should occur during the processing of requests for help from people who claimed they were sexually assaulted on duty.
The Congress was introduced nine separate proposals put forward by a group of senators and members of both political parties, and they proposed a number of corrective measures.
According to the agency for preventing and addressing sexual violence, the Ministry of Defence in 2010 reported 3,158 sexual assaults.
This type of attack remains mostly unannounced and the Pentagon&#39;s own estimates, this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents, which occurred in a given year.
In a report issued in March is analyzed and the rate of prosecution of suspects: In 2010, the court received 20 percent of cases reported in the army - which is half compared to the civilian judicial system.
The claimants in the case of Deputy Burke described the attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
Private First Class Lyman reported the alleged rape, such as military police less than an hour after it should have.
During the night, he says, was asked to give details about his repeated rape of eleven different members of the police, doctors and commanders.
Underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape and her bed was found the blood forward - from the wound, which he did on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended the hearing before the court, during which she was asked questions relating to whether the day of the attack in love with her boyfriend.
It summons six persons as witnesses to testify in favor of the reputation of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
&quot;I remember the day when the judgment was given,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I think right then and there give birth - I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot;
&quot;They placed me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember that I was his commanding officer said: It was not his trial. Was mine.&quot;
Lyman ordered to attend a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which it described as unfit for service.
In January 2010 the army was without honor, and therefore not entitled to seniority released.
Whatever the case Lyman and other applicants will move to the next phase or not, it&#39;s the long run, says John Turley, law professor at George Washington University Law.
However, remarks, &quot;From my point of view, should be able to advance to the next stages of negotiation.&quot;
Between them and the said verdict, however, is a doctrine that has been criticized from the first moment he saw the light of day.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the doctrine of Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind, because their duties do not provide the same level of motivation to comply with incentives and deterrent capability.
He adds: &quot;The odds are heavily against them ... but it is important for them to try it.&quot;
The change will only happen when good people are willing to fight.
Unless the hearing decided in their favor, Burkevoá, the plaintiffs lawyer, gathers hundreds of other people ready to take action and begin to work on other matters dealt with regarding this topic.
&quot;Not cease with the army to fight on this issue, where there is no reform,&quot; he says.
Or until you die, whichever comes first.
The walls have eyes: How can scientists have been studying on Facebook
Before Anders Breivik Behring became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, was just another young man who presented their views, anti on the Internet.
On Monday Braivik who admitted the July vraždícímu rampage, which left over 77 dead in Norway, participated in his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act on its own in cyberspace definitely not alone: ​​during the preparation of an attack a lot of time spent at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of supporting right-wing nationalist groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to learn about these people more.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
&quot;We realized that the find is not actually all that difficult,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent British research team reports, covering the European digital populism.
The supply of personal information on Facebook is so extensive, Bartlett says that scientists enough to simply use advertising on the site and thus determine with absolute accuracy sought demographic group - something that marketers have done for years.
Bartlettův team across Europe found half a million supporters of right-wing groups, and then focus attention on them and sent them advertisements. However, instead of through them is invited to the newly created group, or offer them some dietary products, urged them to complete a questionnaire in which they occurred questions regarding their level of education, relationship to violence and optimism in relation to their own future.
Through Facebook to Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave office.
&quot;It&#39;s a completely new way of conducting research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: on-line supporters of right-wing groups are mostly young men, which irritates the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, &quot;those who have their online activism combined with off-line activism are wiser, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.&quot;
DEMOS team work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, scientists and health policy researchers use these sites to study everything from health issues to social trends lurking status updates, wall posts and pressed the button &quot;I like it.&quot;
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each day will provide an average of three different data, making the social network has made a &quot;supernova information&quot; behind the development of many new research. Number of academic work, in whose name the word occurs Facebook has increased compared to the situation five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists the magic of Facebook lies in the fact that it gives them the opportunity to study people without the hassle on the street.
&quot;Previously it was determined that if you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify.&quot;
&quot;You&#39;d have to get to the side where you would never let go,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;It all breaks down Facebook - just go directly to them.&quot;
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify the socio-medical problem and avoid them.
In a recent study, Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outputs on Facebook, were much more vulnerable to the problem of alcoholism than students who remained silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that students&#39; peers monitor the site and came up with an offer of help to a student who publishes too many drunken status.
&quot;The problem is not solved if it can not diagnose,&quot; the Washington Post said Dimitri Christakis, co-author Dr. Moreno and Director of the Center for Health, behavior and development of children at the Children&#39;s Research Institute in Seattle.
&quot;We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have a chance to emerge.&quot;
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of their users.
Information developed by a team of site statistics about the context of relational status and on St. Valentine&#39;s Day, turnout in 2010 and the satisfaction of the nation&#39;s coefficient (mainly using the information to which they had access - Internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site had its treasure of information made available for research as well as others).
But Facebook users know that the page is monitored, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site must provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of the research, which do not even know?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data off-line. On-line data are not accessible to everyone.
&quot;I think most people imagined that scientists could be seen in their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006, carried out using public facebookových walls of their students.
&quot;If they were, they took it so that only the information between them and their friends.&quot;
Then also consider the question of methodology.
Even when off-line research, there is no guarantee that the body is completely honest.
On Facebook there is no way to verify how much of the information on the profile and contributions to the true wall.
&quot;What do you think about Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, these are two entirely distinct things,&quot; says Selwyn.
That is why Selwin who spent long years of research into new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook and remain the best possible tool that can be used in research.
&quot;When you go into the real world and talk with real people, this is something that can not be replaced,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research should be on the company and social activities - a heck of a lot of social activities are still taking place off-line.&quot;
&quot;Cold and inhuman&quot;: Anders Breivik Behring involved his first public trial
Anders Breivik Behring, a man who confessed to planning the two attacks, during which it was this summer in Norway killed 77 people during his first public court hearing in Oslo, described himself as a warrior &quot;resistance&quot;.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement between the Norwegian and the Knights Templars,&quot; he said in court, where 500 people gathered.
&quot;I object to the Court, because the mandate you gave those promoting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.&quot;
&quot;I confess to his actions, but admitting no guilt for them.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue interrupted because &quot;Breivik not give the opportunity to be heard this used as a podium from which he could preach his views.&quot;
For the same reason, refused to Breivik, who has brought a prepared speech, to allow the end of the hearing to address the relatives of their victims.
Nesheim also ordered the police to Breivik held in custody another 12 weeks, he forbade any contact with the media for 4 Týn and announced that the spheres of government will have eight weeks for complete control over all the visits and all correspondence.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look into the eyes Breivik, others in order to make sure it is kept firmly under lock and key.
Everyone participated in order to move the case to an early conclusion.
&quot;I thought he looked cold and inhuman,&quot; said one commentator NRK attack survivors.
&quot;It was not pleasant, but for myself I can say that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved back a little further.&quot;
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm throughout the hearing and professional. On arrival and exit the building without difficulty journalists present outlook and to the survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivikově bizarre notion that it is part of a larger movement of &quot;resistance&quot;, the judge naznal that is not crazy, and noted that there is no evidence that would have any accomplices.
For some consolation may be that the attacks of 22 June seems to be the work of extremists and not a single group of radicals.
It does not automatically diminish grief and confusion that are still in the minds and hearts of the nation.
&quot;I wish her out as a monster, but it is not,&quot; said a relative of one of the victims.
&quot;If so, it would be much easier.&quot;
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs Firing in the film to cinemas this week
When Steve Jobs 5th died in October, began to discover the views of people who compared him to Henry Ford - and elected him as its greatest modern genius inventor.
The recently rediscovered Jobsově interview, which was dusted for special film, which is heading to theaters this week, will be for all fans of Apple the fact that his creative mind perfectly understand business processes and workflows standing behind his products.
It was an amazing designer, dreamer and self-appointed member of the hippie movement, but also the organizer and pedantic man who every detail fits into the smallest details - believed that many businesses are suffering, &quot;the notion that truly great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [ but] the great idea and an excellent final product is still a long way to bite work. &quot;
In 1995, Bob worked on the TV show Cringely Triumph fools computer, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming took place unique, more than an hour interview.
By then it was already ten years since Jobs has been forced to leave Apple, and had his hands full with his new computer company NeXT, and eagerly looking to take the general public access.
The TV show was eventually used only a small part of the interview Cringelyho and original copies of the interview was said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after the death Jobsově VHS copies were found in the director&#39;s garage.
It is this material, slightly edited, is the basis 68minutového image Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which heads into selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is famous for its reluctance to provide long talks, there has surprisingly Jobs enthusiasm that can be drawn out of his philosophy of technology and business strategies.
And also proves to be very thoughtful man.
Four times during the conversation happens between that question and the answer comes a long pause - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, which is seen as the perfect answer then develops Jobs to be as brief and accurate.
There are also moments when the sail surface Jobsův perfectionism, when the issues Cringelyho act impatiently and hurries him to quickly get to important issues and topics.
The interview was filmed before the Pixar era, iPod or iPhone and appear in it frighteningly prophetic thoughts when Jobs assess what other companies are doing well and poorly, but offers its own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
One thing is to read the reviews Jobsovy posthumous career, but for Jobs, whom we see here as eager dreamer in the flowering of his genius is something raw and inspiring.
Here has its own vision of how the thing could and should look like.
It did not take long, and once expressed his thoughts, he is also put into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from Lost interview is definitely worth noting:
How he learned to manage the business:
&quot;During the years in business, I always asked: Why are you doing? And the answer was always the same: Well, that&#39;s how it&#39;s doing.&quot;
Nobody knows why he does what he does, never on matters relating to the business does not think in depth.
That&#39;s what I found.
Jobs continues by describing his efforts to simplify the accounting in the Apple.
He was utterly confused by the way costs have been recorded - often beginning with &quot;standard costs&quot;, their size could only guess. At that moment he decided to go their own way - has developed an automatic tool that guarantees that they could determine the cost of business in no time.
As the Pope made mischief:
Jobs says the &quot;Blue Box&quot;, which was constructed with Steve Wozniak - devices that enable people to effectively hack into the phone company and call for free anywhere in the world.
The equipment that was already written in the past many, but Jobsovo thrilled when Blue box describes it as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
It tells how to Wozniak tested the device using the pay phone during a call and let the swap from one network AT &amp; T to another, while to use as many satellites.
&quot;At least we půltucetkrát this round twined around the world, so when we then shouted something to the pay phone, it came a minute later from the other phone at the door,&quot; laughs Jobs.
&quot;We were young and we found ourselves able to construct something that is able to manage infrastructure worth billions of dollars around the world.&quot;
You two have made a tiny little thing who could control a much larger giant - it was an incredible experience, and I would have never been without Apple.
Jobs goes on to describe prank that Wozniak with almost dragged to the end. Through the blue box in the middle of the night called to the Vatican and asked about whether they could speak with the Pope, taking the best posing as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually they were called upon more and higher-ranking members of the Catholic Church, in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, and only shortly before the phone woke up and the pope himself, the couple laughed and put the handset.
How to fall in love with technology (and telephoned Bill Hewlett)
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts, so that he could build a frequency meter, found in the telephone number on the list of Bill Hewlett and called him.
Not long after their 20 minutes of conversation already secured Jobs had a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;Incredibly influenced me. It was the only company that I knew at the time, and shape my view of what it really such a society is and how to treat their employees.&quot;
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company&#39;s research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw &quot;the first desktop computer ever made.&quot;
He was big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor and I fell in love with him immediately.
As a teenager I progressed in HP up and up, I hung around the computer and began to write programs for it.
How to invent innovation:
Jobs at several places during the interview talking about how to invent new products at runtime.
At the beginning of his career when he went to sell a pair of printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to put together for him together the whole computer.
There had only 30 paid days, during which he had to invent, assemble and deliver the finished device.
When he was later at Apple, recalls the challenges faced in the development of a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember how we fought quite fiercely ... shouting at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, which would cost 300 USD] when I was bored, I went out and found a designer.&quot;
Ninety days later, we were able to produce perfectly reliable mouse for 15 USD.
As large companies out of breath:
Long before leading the resurrection of Apple, Jobs wisely predicted that many industry leaders in their vision falters and loses its market share.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM and Xerox, so you do better copiers or printers, so what next?&quot;
Do you have a monopoly on the market, so the company already company can be successful.
At that moment it dominates sales and marketing, so businesses boss people who are responsible for just that, while the people in charge of their own products are neutralized in the decision-making process.
Technological genius who led the company to its unassailable position, is now replaced by people who have no idea about good or bad products - skills and technical knowledge is necessary.
That&#39;s exactly what happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have literally the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times greater than could be Microsoft nineties ...
Instead of victory, however, setting the stage for a defeat.
What takes innovation as a form of art:
&quot;The great idea and an excellent final product is still a long way and a lot of work ... and how he develops a great idea, so even changing and growing.&quot;
During that time it will learn a lot about him.
You must agree to a number of compromises - some things just electrons, glass, or factory robots do not be made.
You must remember always 5000 things - different concepts - and put them together ...
Finally, depending on taste - trying to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some way is trying to reflect what you are doing yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I have never been ashamed for the fact that I stole the best ideas.
Společnost Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked there were great musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally also the best computer scientists in the world.
Without computers and new technologies would prove amazing things in completely different sectors.
Scalia and Thomas dined with opponents of the bill on health care when their case to court
The day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept the challenge to the law of President Obama&#39;s health care, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended the gala dinner sponsored by the law firm that will before the court to participate in negotiations.
The incident occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the submitted proposals.
One of the discussed cases the action was raised by 26 states challenging the radical overhaul of health care that Congress approved last year - a law which mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed that the application will listen. In March, however, expected 5.5-hour meeting, the outcome also stirred up even more presidential elections are scheduled for 2012 and at the time a decision will be in full swing.
Lawyer who confronts the Court and seek to achieve rejection of the law will most likely Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush.
Clement Law Firm, PLLC Bancroft was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner group, which for many years engaged in the defense of conservative principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, representing one of the trade associations challenging the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which they are in the process of a huge stake in the funds.
Dinner was held in Washington hotel several hours after the court debate on the said case.
Attended by, among others, also Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and confirmed opponents of the law on health care.
And the placing of guests? Scalia and Thomas.
There is nothing new: These two judges are Federalist Society, a group of events involved in for years.
And certainly it is not even about anything that was contrary to the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempted from the principles of behavior that are subject to lower federal judges.
If it was not, their behavior would definitely fall under the principle of C4, which states that &quot;a judge may participate in events that are currently connected and organized by other organizations in order to obtain funds, but a judge may not be speaker, guest of honor, nor be featured at the event. &quot;
However, Scalia and Thomas relation to the two law firms in the case of performers, as well as companies with huge financial interest in this case, more than enough to alerted activists calling for ethics in government.
&quot;This is a shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct is contrary to what some judges, the Supreme Court acts under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
&quot;The judges dined and drank at the party benefici with attorneys who are waiting to discuss your case before the court.&quot;
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines all claims to the legs impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas to their critics have shown little understanding of them and sent word that they also seamlessly combine their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas&#39;s wife Ginny is a senior conservative activist.
Conservatives have argued that the ethical problem has mainly Judge Elena Kaganovich and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kaganovich worked as Attorney General under President Obama, when he first appeared before a court challenge to the law.
Critics Kaganovich pushes her to renounce participation in the case, arguing that the law had fought as much as to now be disinterested.
Kaganovich does not indicate that she was about to resign.
Boeing received a record order for jets worth $ 18 billion
Emirates Airlines ordered 50 Boeing jets dvouuličkových 777 with purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner, airlines, Air Aman at which collects more than $ 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 units of its products, it usually is no reason to celebrate.
However, if that company aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and price of these 50 aircraft together is a record $ 18 billion, it is something else.
Equally important news is that, where Boeing was awarded the contract: Middle East, growing bonanza for future aircraft orders.
According to projections released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines in the Middle East over the next 20 years need 2,520 airplanes worth $ 450 billion.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest order in history, in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 jets dvouuličkových
Sensational order came from Emirates airline based in Dubai.
Boeing to Fair Air Show 2011 Dubai said that the airlines have the option to buy another 20 aircraft, thereby making the total contract value reached 26 billion USD.
On Monday, after Boeing announced that Oman Air airline ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes known as the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total price of the six planes exceeds $ 1 billion.
&quot;This is excellent news for the Boeing company,&quot; said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
&quot;The quality of these particular customers is very high.&quot;
Many airlines in the Middle East is oil based producer nations there established.
This means that not only have money to pay for aircraft, but the increase in fuel prices - mostly affecting airlines, because it is one of its major costs - is not as crucial as the country itself to earn higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or defer aircraft orders due to the increase in fuel prices, says Dihora.
&quot;They have the natural protection,&quot; he says.
Contract from Emirates airline strengthens leadership position in the market Boeaing wide body aircraft and brought to narrow Airbus SAS, who wanted to try to disrupt the dominance of Boeing with its traffic model A350.
Boeing victory comes four months after Airbus representatives reported that there is a postponement of the first flight of the largest aircraft A350, which is a direct competitor of the 777-300ER aircraft.
The postponement was because customers demanded greater aircraft payload and range, so I took the time to manufacturers to allow the machine to give more power to the motor.
The stock price of Boeing Co rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
Sister Mexican president was apparently defeated in elections michoacánských
Maria Luisa Calderon&#39;s claim that her opponent, Faust Vallejonovi of the PRI, have helped the governor&#39;s chair hunt for traffickers.
It seems that Felipe Calderon&#39;s sister in violent national elections the post of governor of Michoacan lost. On Monday, then said that one of its opponents to victory helped drug dealers.
Preliminary results has assigned the lead in the Western state elections guvernérských Faust Vallejo by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
&quot;Interventions members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of the elections yesterday is alarming not only for Michoacán, but for our entire country,&quot; said Maria Luisa Calderon in an interview on the radio the day after Sunday&#39;s elections.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, members of the group poll ... confiscated ballot boxes, built roadblocks ... and let people vote in order for the PRI.
Party, the PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it came to the presidency.
However, plans to soon return to power and victory in elections in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
PRI party hopes to win in July in a presidential election.
It appears that Vallejo defeated Calderón, who still led the day before the election, very closely.
Calderon, candidate for the Conservative Party of National Action of his brother&#39;s Party, or PAN, refused Vallejona recognized as the winner.
Third placed Aureolis Silvano, a candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party Party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the gubernatorial office. For quarreling and hapless party as the presidential election in 2012 is a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results to be valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia on behalf of, any relations with drug traffickers and refuses encourages other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the home state of President Calderon and just in Michoacan in December 2006 launched a military fight against traffickers.
However, violence persisted.
The mayor of the PAN, Maria Luisa Calderon supporter, was murdered only a week before the election and the election of many candidates withdrew out of fear.
Whatever the results of elections in Michoacan look for the PRI however, the wins will help gain new impetus.
Expected representatives of the PRI&#39;s presidential elections, Enrique Pena Nieto, of Vallejo Wahingtonu congratulated and said, &quot;I think this victory, given the upcoming year could be very encouraging.&quot;
Bank ADB urges Asia to help save the Eurozone
Bank Asian Development Bank called on India and China were prepared to help rescue the Eurozone before the severe debt crisis, otherwise it could lead to an overall decline in the global economy, which would have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, Managing Director of Bank ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economies in the world must &quot;do everything in their power&quot; to facilitate the rapid recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements .
Warned that the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] follow all European problems &quot;too casually&quot; and said that the Asian financial aid in conjunction with the European leadership and resources to help ward off long-term collapse of the global economy.
&quot;We&#39;re all in this together.&quot;
&quot;So it fits anyone who could help Europe out of the crisis,&quot; he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
&quot;Asia is perhaps to some extent protected, but is certainly not immune.&quot;
&quot;So if China and India can help, it certainly would have done.&quot;
European Monetary Association has been heavily tested a few months a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, borrowing costs have risen dangerously Italy and Government of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy could again withdraw into recession, and began to discover the call to head the newly booming economies have joined the euro area and help find solutions.
Mr. Nag predicted that all Asian support will be channeled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as buying bonds Fund bailout of the European Union, European institutions for financial stability - the Asian partners of European countries provide greater bargaining power.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commerce, said that &quot;India will do what he could&quot; to help the euro zone, because its own economy is now suffering from decline in exports and inflow of foreign capital dried up.
&quot;Nobody wants to euro area remained unstable and restless,&quot; he said.
&quot;We face a difficult task and we must maintain a high growth rate.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s an alternative, it is a plain fact, because how else we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women.&quot;
Others argue that emerging economies such as India that have no business helping European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S. said it would be politically very difficult to explain support for Europe&#39;s 1.2 billion population of India, when 800 million of them living on 2 USD or less per day.
&quot;One might find that the Greeks going to retire at fifty and enjoy your holiday on the beaches, which they would hardly explain,&quot; he said.
Lee Howell, Director General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why they should be used in Indian stocks to keep well-paid jobs in many Greek citizens in poorly managed and unprofitable sectors such as rail transport.
Mr. Nag stressed that the crisis threatens the euro area &quot;dangerous domino effect.&quot;
Bank forecast that Asia will be between the years 2011/2012 to 7.5% economic growth, now faces &quot;downside risk&quot; because of the threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must develop &quot;plans for unforeseen expenses&quot; to be protected from decline and significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress really put under the boiler, he warned that the looming automatic budget cuts could jeopardize national security and financial cause a chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefield in Afghanistan to the civilian assembly lines.
Pentagon will spend an already reduced budget of $ 450 billion over the next ten years, but now fears a further reduction of $ 600 billion if Congress fails to conclude an agreement on spending.
&quot;The impacts of these cuts would be devastating to the whole sector,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that the inability of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called attachment causes a 23% fall flat and stop many new projects.
&quot;Because of the huge reduction used in this ill-judged way, you can not do most of our building and marine projects - you can buy only three-quarters of buildings or ships. Could also cause serious damage to other modernization efforts,&quot; Panetta wrote the senators.
&quot;We will also separate the forced many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction take place so quickly, we will almost certainly also need to send civilians forced to leave, we were able to meet targets.&quot;
&quot;These changes might shake the faith of those who take care of our army and seriously damage its readiness.&quot;
Finally, the cuts also affect the combat units, Panetta said.
&quot;Although funding accounts for possible military operations overseas, this obstávka directly affect, the local operations will be adversely affected by significant changes in other budgets,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;There will be cuts in staff contract, which will result in delays to the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people.&quot;
&quot;The reduction will become paid employees of which will flow, delayed payments to contractors and the subsequent disruption of legal and political support.&quot;
Both senators, Panetta wrote off ten days ago and asked him for details about the possible consequences of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
&quot;Consequences of the Ministry of Defence obstávky could cause rapid degradation of view of the United States as the world&#39;s military superpower.&quot;
&quot;We are strictly against such tough measures,&quot; told senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when a letter published Panettův.
&quot;This is not a conclusion with which we could live, and definitely do not want to sign under it.&quot;
&quot;The planned cuts are a threat to national security of the United States, which should not happen.&quot;
&quot;It remains to be seen whether Panettův fresh warning letter and will increase pressure on Congress approving the budget and amplifies the voices calling for the Pentagon&#39;s omission from the list seškrtaných areas.
Panetta was recently in talks on possible cuts becoming more open, although he switched to his high position at the Pentagon with long years of experience to the approval of budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew that tackles the tough fight.
At a press conference held by Secretary of Defense bypassed week signaled a brief picture of what his department can wait - Army shell, but inside the core is missing.
&quot;It will be like a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;It will be a brigade of ammo.&quot;
&quot;It will not trained as an Air Force pilot.&quot;
&quot;It will be like a paper tiger, as a military barracks, buildings and bombs without a sufficient number of trained soldiers who could complete the mission,&quot; Panetta said at the beginning of his speech at the Pentagon.
&quot;It will be as a unit with no morals, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy.&quot;
&quot;As a result, will welcome aggression ...&quot;
In the annex supplied with a letter McCain and Graham Panetta specifies how the reduction will result in &quot;significant operational risks: late reaction to crises, conflicts and disasters, significant reduction opportunities and parachute deployment around the world and has an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.&quot;
Panetta also said that some of the largest defense projects could wait for completion, including those already tested, even those still in early stages of planning.
On the list were such as F35 aircraft project, the planned new bomber, submarine ballistic new generation, new coastal combat ship and the new ground combat vehicles, which wanted the army and marines to replace Humvees.
Stopping further development and testing of F35 aircraft would be over the next ten years, save U.S. $ 80 billion, but its supporters argue that it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed to deal with potential ground threats from China and other rivals .
How to recognize a lie
A glance at recent headlines suggest, how serious and pervasive are the lies and deception in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has his hands full with accusations that sexually harassed several women - both sides claim that the other was lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were charged with perjury when they tried to hide records that retired football coach of sexually attacking a boy.
Last week the French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been caught, how the running microphone says U.S. President Barrack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lie could destroy entire career and zacloumat stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published the information that was immediately refuted by undisputed evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of being misused funds from his campaign to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And never forget the media circus that broke out about Bill Clinton when he lied during the second period in office of his sex with Monica Lewinsky Eq.
Everywhere is packed with stories about cheating in school and at university.
There are cases where teachers give their students their own test answers, only themselves to look good in their reports.
Mentors, who should teach otherwise, send the message that lying and deception is acceptable.
How many scams have come across?
Studies show that in a single day Zalze somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Suppose that many of them are the merciful lie.
Another study showed that strangers during the first ten minutes of the first meeting he lied three times in my life.
Determination of lies, or &quot;lie detection&quot; is an essential skill that should make everyone learn, whether for personal or professional reasons.
This is not no party game that would be similar to, say, Charade, when a man shouts &quot;Gotcha&quot;. Detection of deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected during the last six decades at prestigious universities in the detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One result of this research is that most of the old myths about the lie was refuted.
Liars will still look into his eyes.
It&#39;s not that they are stumbled, stammered, blushing or fidgeted.
But not up to the fact that it is somehow difficult to detect a liar and boots.
Trained lies identifier can reveal the truth of sentence structure, small facial features, mode of formation of questions and their timing.
I spent several years collecting extensive scientific knowledge and developing the sector regarding the detection of lies and it is clear that detecting deception is an advanced skill that is easy to learn in today&#39;s complex world, you can greatly help - especially if one of your responsibilities include recruitment, organizing interviews, negotiating or leadership.
Good liars are able to read well in the other, let&#39;s let his guard down, directing their emotions and intuitively aware of how the other party accepts.
From research we know that extroverts lie more than introverts, pronouncing that men more &quot;self-centered&quot; lies, while women tell more lies &quot;aimed at other&quot; - largely to protect someone&#39;s feelings - that married people were lying to their partners less often than single people (of course, lies that say most are &quot;outrageous&quot;).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when you lie.
How do you know that someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called &quot;initial observations&quot;.
With him will later identify with what to compare.
Notice the body posture, his laughter, with the voice work.
You should know if anyone ever routinely pats down to wrongly accuse him of lying just because you start patting through meetings feet.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
Think of it but only as warning signals, not as proof of lies.
People may stop uttering false move upper body when trying to recall his fanciful story, can make toes to the door, lean to the east, significantly change the posture or evince &quot;relief after the conversation&quot; - exaggerated Sighs of relief and change position when the confession is difficult for them.
People conducting interviews often issue false signal that the interview is over, just to see how it will look like a relief after his termination.
Feel the body language.
Famous is the story of how Scott Peterson přeřekl once and used the past tense when he claimed that his murdered wife is alive, which ran nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals may also be curt comment: &quot;I had no sexual relations with that lady ... Miss Lewinsky&quot; or a difficult question repeated.
The most common verbal signs are very slight.
Anyone can use a lot of &quot;moderating the language&quot; when answering a difficult question: &quot;Well ... to be honest ... from what I know ... the best of my knowledge.&quot;
In such a response is too often and know the facts for the next warning signal.
There is no magic, which would have to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills with which you can ferret out lie.
With these skills will have one more chance in their personal and professional nenaletí some liars and cheats.
A controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat emerged delay approval of the U.S. Government
Several days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - which he played off against each other unions, environmentalists, but calmed down - a company with the construction of pipelines in charge announced that it is willing to redirect the project so that they can be things in motion again.
The company on Monday evening, TransCanada announced that it moves the planned route of pipeline ecologically sensitive areas in the Nebraska Sandhills, and believes that the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of Nebraska government.
Representatives of TransCanada Pourbax Alex says that the company is confident that the pipeline construction will eventually be approved, even though another route leads.
This announcement came after the Foreign Ministry last week announced that it is postponing a decision on federal approval of the project, where does not study the possible alternative routes through which it would be possible not to intervene in the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground reservoir of water.
&quot;This is really moving forward,&quot; said Republican Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska for Fox News.
A new environmental report commissioned by the State Department would probably postponed any decision until the year 2013, one year after the elections next year, but the authorities deny that the decision would play a role in politics.
Obama in a written statement last week described the decision as required by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and expressed their support for him.
1700 miles long pipeline will connect the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.
From Alberta to refineries in Texas by a day flow through 700,000 barrels of oil.
This way will be cut through 6 states.
This project absolutely hate environmentalists, but he loved the work crew, which estimates that the pipeline will work on 20,000 new jobs.
Legislators in Nebraska, however, stood against the plan and consider the introduction of laws that would have forced the company not to intervene in the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
Existing studies on the environmental impact, commissioned by the State Department found that the project will have only a small negative environmental impact, but the source of the energy industry said the inspector general of the Ministry ordered a new review process of the original study, and focused mainly on two questions.
One was whether TransCanada lobbyist hired by the company, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser in 2008, Hillary Clinton, did not constitute a conflict of interest in the program.
Other then that the company that was hired to conduct the original study, was chosen inappropriately, because she had ties to the company TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of being the toddler threw up because of her fears
New York&#39;s family claims that the singer Patti LaBelle furiously stormed into the lobby of Manhattan&#39;s house and scared their daughter so that she is scared of it threw up.

When Kevin Monk present his car, Roseanne Monk went down to the baggage hall of their house in the Riverside Boulevard and bear with me and Genevieve.
Roseanne Monk said that at the door for a while and stopped for a moment the child is given away.
&quot;Someone came behind me and said,&quot; You know what your daughter doing? &quot;I said &#39;yes&#39; and I went to make it up&quot;
LaBelle pregnant woman angrily scolded.
&quot;Aggressive tone she said:&quot; You should ask your daughter to the door, &quot;&quot; Monk said Roseanne.
&quot;I told her:&quot; I do not care about your opinion. &quot;&quot;
She was furious and started swearing - loudly nejsprostší those terms ...
She was carrying a bottle of water and it began to splash water at me.
They argue that Genevieve was hysterical.
&quot;I told the woman:&quot; Look what you did to my daughter. &#39;&quot;Said the mother of the child.
LaBelle at her mother - who was still in her arms Genevieve - she fell and had to stop her entourage, who then dragged her into a waiting car, Roseanne told Monk.

Unfavorable economic climate hindered
During the first year of Mario López Valdez increased unemployment in Sinaloa and unreliability, decreased foreign investment and with them the economy
The year 2011 will go down in economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of government Mario López Valdez, which she calls the government changes. This government has brought high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, because of unfavorable weather conditions at the beginning of the year there was no growth and even there was a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
Low temperatures in February have caused millions in losses in agriculture, limited growth opportunities for the state economy, are responsible for the reduction of economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In agriculture, there is the historical decline of 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to a report of damage caused, published by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development costs have been recorded on 582 835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% had partial damage. The main crops are destroyed vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant rise in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography in the state unemployment rate recorded during the first three quarters increased growth. From January to March were 55 053 unemployed population of the state of Sinaloa, which represents an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter unemployment rate rose to 5.28% and between July and August the average unemployment rate continued to grow, reaching 6.19%, which represents about 74,000 unemployed. Compared to the first quarter, then the number of unemployed increased by 18,969 persons.
Less liquidity
Over the course of unemployment in the state of Sinaloa can more factors. According to Gerard Lopez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, UAS can explain the rise in unemployment indirectly, by steps that were performed at the level of public policy.
&quot;We are seeing rising unemployment, which is related to different factors. These include loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation approved by Congress in the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally empower dollars not easy to get them earned, invest it or use it for something, &quot;he said.
Stopping migration
Lopez Cervantes said that the increase in unemployment is also involved in the demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who go abroad to work, to the United States fell, partly for reasons of difficult entry and then also because even though these people are beyond reach, it is difficult for them to find work. People therefore remain and require the work of our state, and so unemployment is rising, &quot;he said.
Uncertainty
Analysis of labor market deteriorates in Sinaloa also because of the increasing unreliability, which prevails in the area of ​​working conditions. According to the National Statistics Institute for Democracy and 60.38% of employed residents in the state operates without paid their Social Security benefits.
The unreliability of unemployment and other features are added to the labor market, such as low salaries. The administrative territory of the lowest salaries from across the country, as the registers of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was in September 5352 pesos, well below the national average, which moves on the amount of 7,375 pesos.
Reduced foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment was in 2011 also recorded the most significant decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance during the period January to June reached the amount of foreign direct investment $ 630 697, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to the amount of $ 5,143,312 for the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development says the state government investment of $ 17 280 million pesetas per year. These investments were primarily in companies in services.
Debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario that State Government has asked the State Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. It would be for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of EUR 2 600 million pesos. By November, there were no gains from debt, in any sector of national economy.
Reaction
According to representatives of business the first year of the reign of Maria Lopez Valdes pointed to the lack of management skills of government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 lacked the will reconcile the various sectors, including state government itself.
&quot;Developing economies in Sinaloa this year was really tiny. We work hard to ensure that we regain the ground we lost this year. In 2012, we must redouble our efforts, there was no effort to harmonize all of us and especially accurate and synchronized operation of this new government. Hopefully next year will be much better, &quot;he said.
Slowness of the economy
Lopez Loredo said that events such as frosts at the beginning of an end state economy and curb its development and growth.
&quot;Weak economic movement was caused by a series of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences of the economic slowdown, which recovered quickly enough to be able to bring back the dynamism which would allow the movement to achieve an acceptable level of processes, products and services. Why we have to end of the year find themselves below the expected forecasts, &quot;he said.
Re-defining the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, President of the Employers Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, it is necessary to push the state to dynamic productive activities.
&quot;Generally speaking, we see that it works. We believe that it is necessary to prepare a long-term plan, which would be re-defined objectives and economic direction of the state because it is important to mobilize the full potential of material and human resources, which has Sinaloa&quot; he said.
The work that lies ahead
The Chairman stressed the importance of establishing Coparmex vision of the future to better manage the government&#39;s efforts.
&quot;In general I would say that the government is trying to achieve good results in various areas in economic development has been some progress, but it is important to establish long-term plan,&quot; he said.
He stated that the current administration has shown progress in terms of management of public policy.
&quot;There are elements that allow you to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is to see the work done and I believe that the government is aware that it is also a lot of work ahead of us,&quot; he said.

Social projects that are part of programs such as Habitat, public places and Rescue 3x1 for migrants face hazards that are not fastened to the end or that they will have a long delay due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
Director of Municipal Social Development stated that they went so far works forward, now threatens the state government will not be able to provide the supplies that require funds amounting to more than 11 million pesos for three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. State accounts for 25%. By this time the means to work only added and the Federation of town, so it is possible that projects will be delayed.
&quot;They provide nearly 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, we did nothing. And this despite the fact that in July we should get the part,&quot; he said. &quot;To lose time, we started our projects and continue very successfully, but we lack money.&quot;
He said that last year the administration Jesús Aguilar Padilla failed to become the supply, and therefore at the beginning of a new era had to ask the city for a loan that could pay more than 7 million, which they did not give the state administration.
&quot;Same thing we did in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to ensure that they can participate in programs and went on. To get to this year, programs mentioned, we had to raise funds that would cover what the finished state, &quot;he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise from the government představitelů for transmission of these resources, said it was a request to Armando Villareal, the Secretaries of Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and the respective percentages reached as soon as possible.
&quot;They give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, yet we have not even peso.&quot;
Court approves &quot;the end of analogue broadcasting&quot; in Mexico in 2015
Replacement of analogue digital signal is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
State Supreme Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional claim presented by the Senate and Chamber of Deputies against prezidenstkému decree, which wants to hasten the so-called &quot;switching off analogue signals&quot; and implement it in 2015 instead of the 2021st He stated that they did not find the necessary eight votes that would be invalidated.
A minority of four ministers, including President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderon exceeded his powers when he issued a decree giving the individual steps that lead to transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result was an action brought by the Senate, and therefore the failure to reach a qualified majority of eight votes required to enable a court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the aforementioned decree, which remains valid.
Draft judgment prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero submitted a decree to declare as unconstitutional because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is something that is reserved by law for the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). Thus, the violation of the principle of hierarchical subordination and exemptions of the Act.
Voted for the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself.
With this argument, both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight against the decree. Minister Sánchez Cordero accepted and suspended the application requirements of the decree, and all events described in it, leading to the transition to digitization.
Meetings of Ministers also decided to dismiss the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without being entered into discussion on the proposal, which is also the Minister in charge Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech the Prime Minister said that he disagrees with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive can not structure the general standards through measures to prepare public administration.
&quot;I do not think that even if it did, it would have affected the autonomy of the regulatory authority,&quot; and pointed out that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector for the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacement of analogue with digital signals is one of the biggest changes that the world has experienced in recent years. Linked radioelektrického better use of spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
It considers that the change would delay the benefits of digital delay, which requires a decision in a matter of public interest. Digitization is not just a technical dimension, but &quot;also affects the economic, social, political and national security issues.&quot;
He stressed these issues &quot;require operation of the entire system established in accordance with the principle of state economic direction. Includes a wide range of powers by the Constitution entrusts in the hands of state government.&quot;
He pointed out that many countries around the world have already completed the transition to a digital system and did so through their governments, even though they have a highly specialized technical bodies.
He said that it is impossible for the government by issuing a decree disapproving, which to some extent interferes with the powers of Congress, introduced into the administration&#39;s compliance with laws prepared by the legislative power.
In addition to analyzing Michoacán &quot;voice after voice&quot;
According to data released PREP difference between the first and second place in the governor&#39;s election is less than 27 percent. There were 879 votes counted out of 6074 wards.
The possibility of adding &quot;voice after voice,&quot; appeared in this year&#39;s elections in Michoacán, where, in accordance with those published preliminary election results Program (PREP) is the difference between the first and second place in the election of the governor less than 27 percent, even 879 votes were counted from total 6074 polling districts.
In this context, President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, 9 November, the election authority has approved a series of measures that should harmonize with the federal standards of local electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán officially confirmed its political constitution or its Code of Conduct or the State Election Law on Election of justice. National Congress of the reform is approved shortly before the statutory deadline imposed for their entry into force later this term and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel failed to have them published within the period prescribed in the Law Journal and official state that he had any objections against them.
9th The highest state court in November (SCJN) resolved the constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislative power, and the head of state said a voice in the matter of constitutional reform as &quot;illegal and invalid&quot; because no law is &quot;neither approve nor veto.&quot;
When asked about the possibility of adding &quot;voice after voice,&quot; María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that with approval of the General Council of the IEM measure will allow partial or total census carried out by local election authority.
In this way the partial counting of votes, the election of one or more packages will be made under the following conditions: election results do not match, there is no record of the vote counting and calculation in the appropriate box or not the President is available, or if errors were made and the apparent violation of election results.
Moreover, the total recount of votes in every election urns will be conducted if there is evidence to show that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point, whenever you start the session appears express request of the parties and / or coalition proposed by the candidate in second place.
Total recount will be done also when the proper counting is found that the difference between the probable candidate for the winner and second place is equal to or less than one percentage point and also whenever there is an explicit request of a political party whose candidate finished second place. In this case, the election will be excluded packages that have been performed partial census.
It should be noted that in such a situation there is choice in Morelia, where according to PREP is the difference between the first and second place just under 0.16%, although not yet counted 129 of total 923 constituencies.

On Wednesday the appointment of a new Italian government
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian president, introduced him to a new government that will face a crisis that holds this country on the brink of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian president, introduced him to a new government that will face a crisis that holds this country on the brink of economic disaster, which put into danger the whole eurozone.
The presidential palace issued a report that said that Monti, appointed on Sunday, on Wednesday will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano, confirmed to him that he could form a government.
It is expected that the present government composed largely of technocrats, although still not yet clear when the new government takes power.
Monti said that the president will present the results of their talks that led to political parties in an effort to form a government.
&quot;I confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult period,&quot; said the former European Commissioner reporters.
Monti said explicitly that it could form a government, but the tone of his comments suggest that the obstacles are overcome.
&quot;The framework is now well defined,&quot; he added.
Monti completed the process of creating a government in less than three days, at a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against political and financial crisis, due to the amount of the debt climbed to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti has approved tough austerity measures required by European leaders. The only way to restore battered credibility of Italy.
The Monti is a lot of pressure to hurry. Due to market volatility exceeded the interest from the Italian BTP bond with a maturity of ten years of 7 percent threshold level where Greece and Ireland had to ask for rescue.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Confindustria employers&#39; organization, told reporters after meeting with Monti: &quot;We have said that this government will support a&quot;.
We believe that this government is the last chance to get to Italy from the burning situation.
Monti hopes of success are greatly multiplied with the support of the PDL Silvio Berlusconi, the crisis which forced the resignation on Saturday.
&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti is destined to good results,&quot; she told reporters Angelina Alfano, Secretary of center-right parties.
PDL Support, the largest Italian parties is significant because up until this point, many of its members opposed to the technocratic government majority, which compiles Monti.
Support for Parliament
Monti&#39;s new government must have strong support from Parliament in order to promote efficient unpopular reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in the effort could bring a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to the pressure and warns that failure Monti could mean disaster.
Monti began on Monday dealing with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth organizations and women.
Round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed by President Napolitano on Sunday, allowing the reaction to the crisis very fast process.
After a brief decline in the late last week when it was already clear that Berlusconi submitted his resignation, the interest of Italian bonds returned to a critical threshold and respond to the uncertainty whether the new prime minister will reap success.
Save Italy, where public debt is estimated at € 1.8 trillion, would be beyond the capabilities of the current financial reserves.
Monti said that the government should stand in power until the next elections are scheduled for 2013, despite the general assumption that the claim that politicians only give him the time in which to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections .
Monti said he would like to incorporate the policy of his cabinet, but the major parties insist that the government must be composed only of professionals to lead Italy out of trouble into which the country came because of financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate government and political figures.

The quintet included the country in their tour to celebrate twenty years of existence
&quot;Journey to Costa Rica is a dream come true&quot;
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the group is ready to offer next Sunday one of the best concerts at the National Stadium.
We waited more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
Thus said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is located on the South American continent in the tour to celebrate twenty years of existence, and Sunday, the 20th will be a unique stop in Central America.
This day will perform at 19:30 at the National Stadium with the angelic group The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the entire transcript, visit La Nacion on the Internet.
For your Costa Rican fans is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Journey to Costa Rica is our dream that becomes reality.
In South and Central America and the second time we have hardly been a great experience.
I was in Costa Rica only once, on holiday. It&#39;s a beautiful country and I believe that we can stay a few days.
So we are very happy that we can bring our music.
I ask, because this group literally love the fans experience these days of preparation very intensively.
What do you think your fans nejskalnějším?
Thank you for standing by us so many years.
It took us almost 21 years before we got to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry that it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
This raises the more pressure you?
Some of the biggest shows we&#39;ve performed over the past 21 years, occurred within a few weeks.
We showed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we get in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
In fact at that concert too excited.
We love this country, we serfujeme, we like the jungle. For both activities Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
As you know Costa Rica and its convenient to surf waves?
We have lots of friends and surfers have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. Local waves are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua, or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. And so we learn about Costa Rica, through people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you put a great show with many songs.
What you have planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Given that we&#39;ve never played, we have no limit to what we could do.
We will try to showcase the best variety show with songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat repertoire.
Why?
I think it&#39;s partly because we have nine albums, and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it is difficult to choose what songs we play every night.
When we are in the repertoire of two or three songs we played a long time, we concentrate on them and we are surprised because we remember why we liked and so that we may have forgotten it.
This is interesting for us to show, so I think it is more interesting for people.
This tour celebrating 20 years of artistic career.
If you look back, it&#39;s hard to believe everything you could?
Yes, certainly.
First, I think none of us could not imagine that we will be in one big rock band and that it remains more than 20 years. That sounds like a dream.
We realize how much was given to us and moves us, that we can continue to play together.
We love and love we create music.
We are fortunate that we can look at places over which we have always dreamed of.
We could do better.
What you meant that you were an important part of the genre of grunge?
Always it was an honor for us that we can be part of this group in which all these were men giants are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when the movement arises from a group of friends, very often it does not happen.
From time to time arise in the group, but is much less common that one of the city came at a time five to ten groups.
We are proud of it and we are honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
Sometimes we play with some more.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, Soundgarden we saw on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours and had remained together even after all these years still the same members.
Yes, we four together for 21 years, Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a time much longer than normal duration of the group.
I think first we all lucky that we are still in this world and, secondly, a role played by the fact that they are always interested in each other.
We are all close friends and because we managed to open a musical journey that everyone leave sufficient freedom for their own experimentation.
We trust each other, we appreciate the music of the second and I think that it could not be better.
Your relationship to the word fame was not easy. However, due to your success, you can do whatever you like.
How are balance?
As we grew, it was gradually becoming easier to find the balance.
We are too nejezdit on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap and crowds of people who love our music.
When you realize that people come for the music, remember that you have music and what you gave it, respect it. You must not get carried away by the fact that you&#39;re famous, rock star. This is not one of us never really cared.
How do you remember the next project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and it was at the beginning of something spectacular.
As a band we have existed for three years and we have never published any album after he died Andy (Andrew Woods).
It was very frustrating because it took so long. Most important is that even today been friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started the band with us. When you hear a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, as incredible as I laughed with him. It always was a joy to work with him, laugh, talk about music or about football and much more.
It was an incredible person and we are missing too.
National band Las Robertas will be given the task to launch the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose a support slot?
Yes, we sent a video production with a few suggestions this group and we liked the most. Therefore, we wonder what the Las Robertas offer live and be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the words live Yellow Ledbetter?
It is a question to Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I do not know.
He sings it and I think that adds the first thing he can think of.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
My first attack Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many that I could talk all night about bassists who I like.
How did Pearl Jam grunge maintain, though no longer in vogue?
I think we all felt always easily separated from the word grunge.
When you say grunge, imagine a group of which I alluded as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others, which formed at the same time. And if you still like this music is valid, then it is something great, because it is the music worth listening to bands like Mudhoney and play better music now than ever before.
At the beginning of your music had a slightly sinister character and is now more positive.
What is behind this change?
That&#39;s interesting, because I feel that the new album a couple of songs that are lighter-style, but also there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered to be very bleak, although they may send a signal to be positive.
For both, when I played the Ed, I wept, and it is deeply obscure songs.
I think when you&#39;re growing up and some trauma in your life, you lose someone from the family or friend, these things will influence your art and music and these two songs for me are just that.
I also think that you can be a happy man, and although making gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori was re-hospitalized because of medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital, where he will do tests because of muscle loss suffered in the lower limbs, he informed his doctor.
72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving a penalty 25 years imprisonment for human rights violations committed by his government (1990 - 2000), suffers from several illnesses, including cancer of language, for which he was operated on four times and already have doctors currently under control.
Deputy Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told television station Canal N that Fujimori will be within three days undergoing tests at the National Institute of neoplastic diseases, where they should find out why it hurts and why it lost power in the legs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could get a pardon on humanitarian grounds, however, himself a former president does not want mercy, because they feel innocent.
He was operated on four times due to cancer of language, shed 18 kilograms and these problems are compounded by other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, list the doctor.
Fujimori is serving a sentence in September 2007 at the National Directorate of special police operations.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people killed by murderous forces squadron operating illegally in the first years of his reign.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico, to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan president, Jose Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will launch on Tuesday a visit to Mexico. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and touch the political issues of the region.
Mujica on Wednesday will meet with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón. This is the most extensive visit to the meeting full of meetings with representatives of politics, business and community representatives uruguyaské living in Mexico. The Uruguayan president&#39;s office announced.
A meeting of both presidents in Guadalajara will be used to exchange information on policy issues between the two countries, &quot;Uruguayan presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media will try to get Mujica Calderón to promote Uruguay in dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy ranked Latin American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries will continue to remain in the position of tax havens will be excluded from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion of the Uruguay and in consultation with the ambassador of this European country.
Mexico chaired the G20 in November. G20 is a group formed by the most powerful emerging and developed countries of the world. With that Latin American countries have since January this year an agreement on exchange of information having to avoid double taxation.
Government of Uruguay in recent years sought to concretise agreements on fiscal exchange in order to get the &quot;black list&quot; of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of tax cooperation.
From a business point of view Mexico and Uruguay have since 2004 entered into a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), resulting in an increase in exchange of goods between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to the &quot;3D Super Mario Land&quot;
Super Mario has more than 25 years tirelessly fights to save Princess Peach from the clutches of evil Bowser, yet we will never appear in 3D: the &quot;Super Mario Land 3D&quot; will fight for love girls with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming this month to all the shops around the world, was formed from the beginning to take advantage of all features offered by portable console Nintendo 3DS, which allows three-dimensional game play without having to use glasses.
&quot;Mario is a character who has to tell you how it should operate without stereoscopic glasses,&quot; said a worker at Nintendo specialist newspapers in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during a video presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier,&quot; because until now successful movies like &quot;Star Fox 64 3D&quot; or &quot;Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D&quot; were adaptations of existing titles .
Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to the 3D film, &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; is &quot;available&quot; video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
Álvarez confirmed that &quot;Super Mario 3D Land&quot; includes two games in one: the first part is &quot;simple&quot;, whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you get over this level, you can go to the &quot;second round&quot; games at levels that are time consuming.
In addition, users can choose between real time &quot;aggressive D&quot; or one that only affects the depth of the event. But it will be playing in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and &quot;succumb optical deceptions.&quot;
The new onset of Super Mario in 3D is also expected to return figures on a portable console, which occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo is playing into the hands of those who follow the saga and repeats the successful formula of previous episodes. Lies in the fact that the bearded man plumber will have to undergo dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds the news in the movements in the neighborhood, and also disguises the enemy, you are also a &quot;playful&quot; Luigi.
Colom Portillo approved the issue to the United States
President Alvaro Colom on Tuesday announced that advanced steps in the matter of issue of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is responsible in the United States of plotting to laundering $ 70 million.
Thus ends the process, whose aim was to Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country that requires a Portillo that he could judge.
At a press conference Colom, confirmed that his decision is consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive power and has to remember that criminal court has ordered the release.
Assured that during his mandate &quot;interfered&quot; in judicial decisions and allowed to release all that he got on the table.
In addition to Portillo will be handed over to Sergio Ruano Marroquin for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Morales Estrada Estrada and Victor Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colomův step is a step execution after they have exhausted all judicial and constitutional instance, led to a lawsuit against the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued once it has settled its legal situation in Guatemala and to ensure respect for human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty in embezzlement case, 120 million at the Ministry of Defence during his presidency. This process preceded the release, but the Public Ministry appealed and the case returned to the game.
Trinijove 6000 helped the young state of emergency
The organization was founded to help children without education, he came to the margins of society.
Balance first 25 years of the organization of social support is very important Trinijove: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion, have received assistance. The Organisation for 25 years, helping to overcome difficult situations.
To this must be attributed to long-hundred jobs, which for this social group obtained.
Yesterday&#39;s anniversary also served to balance was presented in a ceremony that took place in former factory production areas Fabra i Coats and attended by more than 300 people.
The organization was established in the district Trinijove Trinitat Vella in 1986 to help young people with little education, no work, grappling with addiction to drugs or in a situation where they could fall into social exclusion.
Yesterday&#39;s meeting in Sant Andreu involved a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that in the past 25 years with the association together.
The diverse political representation at the time of the election, showed the unitary character of the work that realizes Trinijove.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Meat Arthur, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol is a ceremony attended by former socialist education adviser, Ernest Maragall, and former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councilor Ricard Goma.
The large hall Fabra i Coats arrived with the current advisor for social welfare and family, Josep Lluís Cleries and CEO of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was a very difficult time and that the present time also offers a variety of obstacles, but added that the work the association has brought to date, &quot;good basis&quot;.
The president said Trinijove as an example of how to combat the adverse circumstances and to impart courage to people in difficult situations.
&quot;The crisis is not for this organization and the work he is doing nothing new,&quot; he said.
An eviction occupied the house in which the parties held a gigantic
Aliens have appropriated 11 of 13 apartments in a building Balmes, 51
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon, without resisted
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by neighbors of the number 51 in Balmes street, is finally over.
Twelve people yesterday at noon voluntarily left the building they occupied illegally, and where organized gigantic parties, which aroused the neighbors. The building left of the court order and without having to interfere with the police.
After the operation was traded on the door lock to prevent recurrence.
&quot;From that moment on, the entry will watch,&quot; said the administrator.
Occupiers, who occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - we took all the electrical and water facilities and partly, in addition to painted walls and rubbish left by himself all kinds, especially the cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three dwellings held a huge party that lasted two days and aroused other tenants.
Besides building the disco, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Her owner, Maria Pantin, explained to Europa Press that during a period when the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
Owner discos stresses that occupants of the building made it unfair competition, as they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco is 10th
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to claims neighbors because of noise. But visitors do not cause problems discos, but the residents of the occupied house, and especially those who attended parties held here, the frequency and intensity has increased in recent weeks, according to angry residents nearby.
Owner discos explained that the problems were so great that even agreed with the owner of the building and has already forgiven her nine months rent.
City police also confirmed that in recent weeks received more complaints from neighbors to a given situation.
Chairman of City People&#39;s Party group in the Town Hall PA, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that &quot;the building was immediately evicted and put an end to the problems of civil coexistence, which suffers from neighbors, and destroying the area.&quot;
KDU-CSL chairman explained that before the summer was occupied only one floor, but in recent months, the occupiers were given to all floors of the building and almost all apartments and one of them was even a theft.
In this regard, adding that &quot;it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent if the offenses against civil liability that occurred in the building.&quot;
Yesterday city police evacuated the building in the Nou Barris.
In 15 hours 30 minutes, police came to the building 35 on the street, Mont-ral after being summoned neighbors who saw walk into the building four people.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects met on the occasion of opening a procedure that entails more than the controversy regarding fees
City tender for 16 gates again open debate on the role Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid 80 years, during the heyday of defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the government printed several pamphlets in support of the park Collserola.
Mountain Flyer defined as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
What&#39;s more, he was accompanied by a numerical comparison with the New York Central Park.
After the lapse in 1987, CMB, Park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona. The Catalan capital is indeed one of the few, not aimed at the axis of north - south, but up (mountain) - Down (sea).
Qualification as a natural park Collserola goes in this direction.
Reference has already been Central Park, but with a wild boar instead of Yellowstone Yogi Bear.
Such was the position until September, when the Hall announced a competition consisting of 16 mega auditions for the same number of gateways to Collserola.
Gateway, of course, favors the idea of ​​the park.
Either that, or someone trying to put the gate into the field.
The question is therefore the only question Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both for purely organizational, and on the basis of reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme of all the Barcelona architects.
It&#39;s been just wiped topic, as when two members of the old caste chosen at a meeting in the elevator shake hands.
And this act provoked one of the rare matches between what they think three barcelonští předstoupivší architects and university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modolo Bayona and Martha: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Roldan, after the Gulf now giving thought to the question, &quot;should&quot; discuss about &quot;mountain side&quot; so Ildefonso Cerda expression of green apples was not tightened to the end.
&quot;We start from the principle that the most extensive park is the Barcelona beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, &quot;said the architect, for which the name&quot; Gateway to Collserola &quot;carries&quot; lexikologickou trap &quot;: we can not be present&quot; as the entrances to the park, but rather as defining the areas where it can cause. &quot;
Modolo, as Roldán and Bayona with experience from the world of urban design qualifies as an &quot;intellectual challenge&quot; providing at &quot;some risk&quot;.
Risks due to &quot;uncertainty, we now project a public place&quot; after the experience of the 80 years, the Forum had &quot;his swan song.&quot;
The first concern is the very definition of the borders, where it should be built.
&quot;Something has to do is to define the next step&quot;, that is, in principle, move a step further.
&quot;It should be borne in mind and new urban planning tools because they present (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster.&quot;
If we focus in detail on the question Modolo believes that the valley slope Collserola can be &quot;considered as a park,&quot; but not part of Barcelona, ​​for reasons purely topographical.
Modolo also reminded that there is already work carried out Patronat de Collserola, which &quot;may not end up on the scrap heap,&quot; even though welcomes the fact that Hall offers his council that the project reaches the &quot;first time&quot;.
And it understands that the proximity of mountains and the city is kind of a pass that allows architects to engage in debate, but &quot;doubts&quot; that it should be just this technical profile, leading multidisciplinary teams (&quot;it&#39;s all about skills,&quot; supplies) to be a &quot;Architects should only be a tool.&quot;
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which gave the name of this game is complex, because in the tender documentation for missing Collserola global vision: &quot;It was announced 16 procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal studies which looked at the area and understand it as a whole. &quot;
This means that at least he is enrolled in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the project is one of the gates can run into the concept and definition of the architect neighboring gate.
In his opinion, the Town Hall should ensure that the zone is located immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should secure the entire length of the zone equipment to ensure a smooth transition between the city and greenery.
Jonas Larrazábalovi pardoned Casino, which will be released
After 72 days of imprisonment lawful agent Cadino Red pardoned his brother Mayor Monterrey process, in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Jonas Manuel Larrazábal spent 72 days in jail and will now be released after his lawful agent Red Casino pardoned before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which came before the extortion case in which the brother was indicted mayor of Monterrey.
After the assassination of Casino Royale Red Casino owner, Sergio Garcia Gil, published a series of photographs and videos, where Manuel had to ask Jonas after the payment of economic quotas in Monterrey city hall to allow illegal gambling operation in the house.
After a public indictment of the State Prosecutor&#39;s Office initiated criminal proceedings against the mayor&#39;s brother panistického. Second September was arrested and jailed for 30 days.
After spending 4 hours before the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes was transferred to a prison, located in the Barrio Antiguo in the capital of the state.
At this point remained following 49 days after the second one was handed to the arrest and the agent of the Public Ministry refuted the possibility of involvement or organized crime.
On 19 October was transferred to criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of extortion by the owners of Casino Red one and a half million pesos. However, only a few hours remained in prison with moderate supervision, because he was threatened with death.
Leaders allowed him to remain in the process of urban cells in San Nicolás de los Garza.
25th October brought before an order for arrest issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after nearly two months of investigation has been collected enough evidence to prove the guilt of Jonas. The evidence include payment for the 1.5 million peso representatives of the casino in exchange for a promise that the operation will be possible.
This Monday is a statutory agent Red Casino, Víctor García Gómez Aldo, came to the judge José Luis Pecina and asked for mercy for his brother the mayor of the region. On this basis, it will soon be able to return to freedom.
During negotiations with the legal representative of the Public Ministry assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias García Gómez asked whether the damages were repaired and one of the partners decided to grant pardon. Lawyer but made it clear that the name will remain confidential.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011 shall be granted statutory grace Jonas Larrazábalovi. In the process, which was against him, you can not lodge any complaint. We also can not seek compensation for damages or punishment.
After the hearing, acting with lawful court order around 15:50 for the immediate release Larrazábala Breton.
Court Secretary, Jorge Yanez, came to the prison in San Nicolás de los Garza, announced that Jonah, that he had been granted official pardon and his case was postponed to the archive.
He also announced that a judge issued a regulation on its immediate release.
Dionisio Perez Jacome Secretary presented the details about the accident, which killed the governor&#39;s secretary, Francisco Blake, and another seven people.
Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of investigation of the accident that killed Secretary Francisco Blake Mora government and seven persons indicate that the helicopter landed right on the ground with full force, without the pilot had a chance to try a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said the aircraft before the start of the pilot found that the climatic conditions allow for years.
&quot;Parts that appear suggest that the unit came in contact several times with the terrain, the wings caught in the branches of trees 25 meters from where the unit lost trunk.&quot;
Also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore meet all the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that based on investigations carried out in the impact zone were not found on earth no parts.
&quot;The search revealed that the aircraft are not in another place, then the plane hit the mainland as a whole.
&quot;The helicopter was designed for 19 people, meet all the requirements for passenger transportation.
Terrain has a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the moment it is important to get the fastest results. However, the investigation may take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the moment of impact, the helicopter moved the Presidential General Staff and a cruise speed accident occurred on soft ground upward.
&quot;This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident was a routine operation, overflight,&quot; he said.
At a press conference representative SCT Perez Jacome listed the six key points of investigations:
Visual years:
In compliance with air standards, the flight was conducted under the rules of visual flight, this means that the flight crew to see the terrain.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports indicate the AICM adequate conditions at the start, in line with the plane progresses towards the boundary between DF and the State of Mexico were apparent cloud layer at low altitudes.
The routes:
It is likely that because of low clouds crew searched the area and greater visibility to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
Coordinates of the impact and the last record of helicopter radar are the same, it is likely that before the crash there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a limited area:
The information that we currently have available, allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a straight trajectory from the side.
Drawing plane scattering debris indicates that at the time of impact was on the helicopter landed whole.
Has been reported fire or explosion.
At the scene, there were no evidence that would indicate that there was an explosion or fire.
Recent results of the investigation indicate that there may be multiple contacts with the mainland.
During the field work were the remains of the aircraft at an altitude up to 9200 feet above sea level, sloping terrain, the amount of slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show scenes in which there appears to decay along the said route.
Information provided by elements that seem to indicate that the helicopter could get in contact with the ground at several places.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, the territory that is larger than that of setting out, found the remains of the helicopter, which strengthens the presumption that the collision occurred in a state where the helicopter was still whole.
Mexican Health Insurance Institute began research on a gene that causes obesity
Health Insurance Institute conducts research to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. Research carried out with the support of experts from the Institute IPN
Mexican Health Insurance Institute (IMSSA) announced that conducts research to identify the gene that causes obesity in children and young people. Research entitled &quot;Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents&quot; to get the results for overweight.
The report leading medical research unit in the biochemistry of the National Specialized Hospital Medical Center 21st century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that was established by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, nutritionists and social workers.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
Engage in research, also the general public, having or not having permission. People can come to participating in sports centers IMSSA in Valle de México, where each file is written will be from 8 am to test adolescents.
He stressed that research began in the Sports Centre Cuauhtémoc (Mexican state) and from 8 October, the activity is carried out also in Nezahualcóyolt Sport Centre (East Mexico State).
Once the data obtained from 500 to 600 children, the study will continue Independencia Sport Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally in Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and traced to Mexican children and young people at risk factors and thus prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Day of diabetes, which is celebrated on 14th November, he reminded that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between six and 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of parents, for application-specific questionnaires regarding nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He stated that every Saturday, all participants carried out anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), measured blood pressure, determines the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and examine the genes (trying to identify genes involved in the creation childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said that this research reflects concern over the alarming increase in health children&#39;s weight.
&#39;Health surveys carried out between 1999 and 2006 showed that just six years, only in boys the increase of obesity by 77% and 47% of girls. The dramatic increase took place also in case of overweight &#39;, said an expert from IMSSA.
He said that one reason for the search parameters is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations of their genetic history.
He informed that the average Mexican has 65% Indian-American genetics, 30% European and 5% African. This is reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.
He explained that, in general genetics of obesity is commonly explained as the inability to burn excess energy they consume (calories), which is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that giving them an overall assessment of the condition of children, which will determine whether a known report being overweight or obese.
He said that even the presence of wrinkles dark colors (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the probability that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and předcukrovkovými states.
The information is still confidential, doctors transmit it in writing to parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes that need to make to their children avoid the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, meaning a lack of daily physical activity, sitting all day watching TV and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Overweight also causes large caloric intake, that is, greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein and genetic load, which is the subject of this research.
The Asphalt from UNAM are not potholes
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty of UNAM produces polymer modified asphalt, creating a blend having improved functionality, regardless of weather conditions and temperature
If properly cared for paving, it would be nearly 200 thousand to repair potholes after each rainy season in the Metropolitan area of ​​Valle de Mexico, Najera pointed Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the Chemical Faculty (FQ) from UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance asphalt pavement was adequate, there would be a significant reduction in erosion, or it could even be completely removed.
In his lecture Technological cause erosion, which said the International Year of Chemistry, has announced that the laboratory under the direction of developing modified bitumen with polymers, which should emerge from a mixture having similar characteristics as asphalt, but greater mechanical strength, both at low and at high temperatures.
Najera Herrera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in areas with extremely warm climates, such as in some cities in the north. This would improve functionality and reduce the creation of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt, the hardest part of petroleum hydrocarbons is a group of molecules, molecules with high molecular weight, called asphaltene, and other low molecular weight, called Malten. Together they give the typical viscoelastic nature of asphalt.
Viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures around 180 degrees, acts as a liquid at 120 degrees has a high viscosity at 50 degrees and is nearly in solid form, while at low temperature asphalt has a tendency to break, he said.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but varies during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, noted expert in chemical engineering.
Faculty of Chemical Scientist observed that most streets in Mexico City is covered with a flexible pavement, which consists of six layers of materials of which the last three are mixed with asphalt.
Between the layers is nejsvrchnějšími asphalt liner, consisting of small stones embedded in the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms the cartridge is sealed with asphalt.
While driving cars or creating pressure, it is possible to force a well-spread on the pavement.
If it was modified asphalt, spread would be even better, it feels a chemical engineer.
He added that the asphalt pad is placed last layer called the mantle, consisting of soft rock, sand is also embedded in the asphalt.
Given that this layer will come into contact with the wheels of vehicles, must have greater mechanical strength than asphalt liner and must provide a friction surface.
Given that as part of pavement will be exposed to heavy load, it must have sufficient thickness and mantle must be careful of the material from which it is made.
Climate, particularly moisture and temperature changes are also very important factor to bear in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of asphalt pads.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inside and it&#39;s hard to get out, it causes a softening of all pavement layers thereby creating potholes.
He explained that during the creation of potholes, as the first film deals damage to tires and then there is damage to the asphalt pads. The damage but not in one moment, but it is a gradual process, which should no longer stop at the first signs using appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of scientists also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in creating potholes, and therefore the thickness of each layer corresponds to the plateau musí paving vehicle and must ensure that the load exceeds this. Only then can we prevent frequent creation of potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that in terms of asphalt, we will have a lot of work and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning for example, asphalt emulsion, which in other countries are already available on the market and make it easy to repair potholes without having to use a high temperature.
What was missing from the Valle candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Serna Melina Ramirez did not receive the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle obtains 14th title of first runner.
Valle del Cauca again reached the crown of Miss Colombia.
Serna Melina Ramirez had to be content with the fact that she was on stage winners, won a silver crown and sash, on the basis of which became the new first runner-up Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday&#39;s final in Cartagena, where she won and took the scepter Miss Atlántico, said the department received 14th title of first runner. Melina joins a multitude of women of Valle del Cauca, which came within reach of winning the crown, but eventually were declared first runner-up. These include Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Bellini Patricia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanqui (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuelo Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The question that many ask. What was missing?
The result is a defeat is a great favorite, which in all previous rounds has shown that it has to become the new Miss Colombia and not in vain became Queen of the police and the nicest tváří Joile de Volgue. These titles have reached such as Italians or Vargas Natalia Navarro, which subsequently won the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors, which ruled that the jury has decided to appoint her only first runner-up, is that not convinced by his answer to the question: &quot;Which book did you like best and why?&quot; Which laid the Murillo Martín Gómez of literary editors Leamos.
The candidate answered the question:
&quot;I read a lot. Very believe in the role of literature, I believe that it is one of the forms zkulturňování. Book that most influenced me as a child, was&quot; The Little Prince &quot;, a very deep book.
Currently reading &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot; It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature which we should all know. And today I bring a book by Irene Nemirovski, Russian author. This is a wonderful book called &quot;El Ardor de la sangre&quot;.
This answer did not like both because the term &quot;culturize&quot; and secondly, because the candidate did not explain what she referred to various books marked.
After the ceremony Melina stated that it is quiet and has a happy outcome: &quot;The world is wise, what happens, happens.
And you people read if you can. The Little Prince is a wonderful book. &quot;
An additional hypothesis is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
Bogotský journalist suggested that the candidate was from the beginning of the most popular, most celebrated and one that took away all previous price (Oster culinary challenge, the title of public art for the best dresses and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, vystresovalo queen, who then on the scene fail.
It was apparent at the first presentation of swimwear on the beach and the Hilton during the final two shows before the coronation.
Although both shone, it was obvious that she lacked the strength and fervor that showed athletes from Atlantico and Magdalena.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the &quot;at home&quot; on Canal RCN believes that the fact that Melinda was named first runner-up confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most during the competition titles eventually leaves the Queen with a crown. &quot;
Moreover, in recent days Valle took the rather unfriendly attitude toward the media and he will not pay.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which are the basis of national beauty contest.
Just on the edge, two days before choosing an international jury member Lucy Doughty said they are looking for a woman who is aware of the social needs of their country.
&quot;In the Miss Colombia beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social awareness. It is important that candidates before they enter the competition, have been involved in such projects,&quot; explained.
He also speculates about the fact that candidate Valle lost points because of weaknesses in their background and fibrosis, which was evident in the abdomen. It is entirely inconsistent with the jury verdict, which it chose Miss &quot;natural beauty&quot; for healthy body, proper nutrition and physical activity, accountable.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares the Queen, recognizing that Melina had the best body, that there were more girls, &quot;but problems with fibrosis of the abdomen, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, she stepped down points on the last day.&quot;
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos Cromos magazine believes that the native of Valle made a mistake when he underwent several surgeries.
&quot;Surgical intervention is in order, but they failed to Valle.
The body has never been her forte, and here took its toll. &quot;
Because of this award, the first National Assembly conferring beauty in a swimsuit after the show there was a cruel prediction that came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina indulged that it eventually had to give the highest crown.
Whether it&#39;s true or not, it is certain that Melina today launched the year of his reign, not as a queen, a princess from a position that gives her the chance to represent Colombia at various international competitions, which will be named itself the National competitions.
However, recorded in history as one of the queens, which, despite success in Cartagena strhujícímu the highest crown or another.
Such was the work of Cali residents, who identified the corpse Alfons Cana
An expert on fingerprints from Cali came into history as the man who confirmed the death, &quot;Alfonso Cana.&quot;
The work of these officials is crucial.
4th November last year, an expert on fingerprints from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the FARC, &quot;Alphonse Cana&quot;, through the comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven experts on fingerprints, who work at the Department of CTI, this week was the turn of Eliazar Gonzalez, the men of Puerto Tejada, who 21 years working in the field of legal research.
At the beginning of his career, González has worked at City Hall in Choco, where they often had more than five days way through the forest to get to the place where the corpse, which had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of Valle and after graduating from the courses, he began specializing in fingerprints. This science is the study of skin friction, ie palms of hands and feet.
In the week when the operation was carried out against that Alfons Canova, Eliazar said to have brought his clothes at least three days.
Expected something big.
Friday night went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspects that one of them is the man who led a guerrilla oldest in the world. Therefore requested to take his card with fingerprints Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when the investigating team arrived at the place where the corpse was located, did not recognize him because of physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, was dressed as a peasant in the field, without glasses, much slimmer.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Along with Galton magnifier, ink and light transplantátorem Eliazar daktylové began to compare records with records from corpses card.
The eye it did not disappoint: it was &quot;Alfonso Cano&quot;.
That same night a man originally from Puerto Tejada was charged with the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, confirmed that indeed was the supreme commander of the FARC.
Stop Searching
For daktyloskopa of Sijín de Cali is recognized that Eliazar Gonzalez showed President Juan Manuel Santos at a press conference, operational services against the &quot;Canova&quot; very significant.
Many people know our work.
Fingerprints is an exact science, no possibility of error that can play a key role in deciding crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses to help these people in the research of crimes such as theft or murder, and confirm the identity of trapped persons.
When caught, offenders presents a lot of false papers or no papers at all.
We take from them and look for fingerprints in the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, had the house to remove the piece of the wall of the house, because at this point is leaning against a thief, that he a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended to take fingerprints, but in this case, we can get the whole impression of the hand and identify the offender, who was involved in several thefts, &quot;he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or refute the suspicion of the murder.
Not long ago a man found dead with bottles of alcohol around.
Based on the investigation it was found that the murder could be one of the responsible family members and the imprint on the bottle is really confirmed.
Although not absolutely confirm that was indeed the murderer, it is clear that appeared on the scene of the crime.
An expert on fingerprints from CTI explained that the fingerprints of the subjects&#39; blurred using reactive chemical or physical agents. &quot;
When observed, they are used for their removal or tape transplantátor.
Fingerprints are then sent to Asif, a database of offenders, or file cabinets.
&quot;The problem is that currently there are still many Colombians, whose details are not recorded anywhere,&quot; said an expert from CTI.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the television program CSI.
Like everything that glitters is not gold, not all of what you touch, traces remain.
However, if it can be used, it must make the appropriate comparisons.
&quot;Outrage&quot; protest in New York
Demonstrator Hundreds crowded the square Zuccotti, where they wanted to camp.
A large part of them waiting for an order removing the space and moved into a nearby park.
Members of the movement, fill provoked Wall Street on Tuesday, representatives of New York when he tried again by court order to get to Manhattan Square, where they were brought out in the morning. Then he tried to take a different New York City park.

&quot;If the court does not permit us to return to the square, sit in another place and we will continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through the assembly and peaceful demonstration,&quot; said one of the spokesmen of the movement &quot;, fill Wall Street&quot;, Mark Bray.
Bray stated that the answer is &quot;outraged&quot; at the eviction of the camp, which he ordered the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, got to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued the orders which banned violent eviction manifestantům place and allowed to remain here stanovali.
In addition, the &quot;outrage&quot; and occupied another park located at the intersection of Canal Street and Central Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and land in the parish of Trinity Church.

The organization assures that the site has settled several hundred people. Came a delegation of religious leaders to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile Zuccotti Square, which is private property, it remains closed. It is expected the trial to be had just on Tuesdays, and during which they should analyze the legality of the morning evacuation.

Representatives of the movement &quot;Ocupa Wall Street&quot; also said that they plan to organize a &quot;big event&quot; on Thursday, in collaboration with community and trade organizations to commemorate two months after that last protest. They have started on the 17th September.

Japan after the devastating earthquake back to life
GDP grows by 1.5% due to household consumption and ends with the fall, which began in March
Since March last year, Japan&#39;s economy was paralyzed, now recovering from the devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the country had to face since 2 World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government estimated the material losses to 300 000 million dollar wound, despite the difficult global situation heals well.
After three quarters of GDP, the value falls between July and September in a position that it was possible to definitively turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and 6% a year.
Results of the second quarter - for the Japanese fiscal year begins in March 2012 - and expect the greatest growth rate in comparison with January-March period of the 2010th
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery, which are necessary for the rehabilitation of areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investment by 1.1%, spending drops by 0.9% compared to January-March period. This is the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the true awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on impulse, which makes use crisis for us to come out stronger from it, or to rehabilitate infrastructure. It&#39;s about the lack of benefit to us to start from scratch.
Japan has awakened. In particular, thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable is increased by 1% due to increased expenditure on vehicles, roads and leisure activities.
Stigma yen
Flows are entrusted into the hands of the internal market, while Yen - Japanese currency - has become one of the &quot;survival value&quot; for investors who are fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and the alarming forecasts of the U.S.. It is a privilege, which is but a heavy burden for export enterprises.
With a stronger currency products are more expensive abroad, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of major technology groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed its weak results in the July-September was the yen exchange rate.
While the markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government is being cautious Yoshihiko Noda.
&quot;We must beware of the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and rapid increase in the yen,&quot; he said yesterday, Secretary of State for Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) pointed out that most member countries in September, showed clear signs of economic slowdown.
Indicator, which predicts rigidity in the world economy, showed that the economy is slowing down the major powers.
Decreased by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area came under even average, which is located at 100th She got down to 99.13 points.
Athens again spread uncertainty
Papadimos says that austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With fast and risk guarantees and marginal uncertainty that prevailed again, Greece increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to the exit of a large debt crisis in Europe.
The assumption that &quot;match&quot; the new transition is given by the Greek government requirements rather than a true conviction Brussels political forces, is beginning to confirm.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that structural reform is no alternative and that a period of 100 days, when he received his appointment is likely to be short for their application, chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures In no case will not support and reiterated his request to call for new elections expected date of 19th February.
&quot;The main task of this government&#39;s decision to apply the summit of 26 October&quot;, said yesterday Papadimos during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow a vote of confidence in the government.
Package with 24 programs having to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message does not clarify Samaras doubts about his position: &quot;We are committed to help the transitional government, but next to nothing we have not undertake.&quot;
Leader of the Conservatives went in his speech to address the EU and the IMF a little far. These organizations have to unlock 8 billion that Athens urgently need. At the same time but said he would not support and will not sign any commitment concerning the implementation of austerity measures.
The European Commission has already furious impact, which caused Papandreou games with the referendum, yesterday emphasized that its requirements must not be exceeded: unblock any help if the new government and leaders of major parties not sign &quot;a written commitment with no ambiguity and as soon as possible.&quot;
A spokesman for economic affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that inspectors from the Troika will return &quot;very soon&quot; in Athens and will negotiate with the new government about &quot;what it needs to pay for the sixth part&quot; 8 billion. The final date but does not exist.
The Greek has the spinner for a bit of what to knit.
Queen Sofia: &quot;There are tools for progress and hope&quot;
Queen of Spain highlights the privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain &quot;achieve a significant position on the global level with regard to microfinance.&quot;
Queen Sofia yesterday reiterated that the country in the last two decades has become the second donor of the planet in terms of the collaboration tool, whose essence lies in the fact that &quot;an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity. It a tool based on trust in man. &quot;
The Queen yesterday launched a fifth global microcredit summit in Valladolid with the conviction that &quot;no doubt&quot; that this kind of operations &quot;is absolutely necessary&quot; for it to achieve the MDGs, the UN&#39;s 2015. &quot;In particular, the objectives that have to reduce by half the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, then the amount, which sets the threshold of poverty.&quot;
Spain &quot;will continue to work&quot; and expand the network of volunteers &quot;in all corners of the planet and takes the job seriously,&quot; stressed the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and benefits of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, &quot;ensure capacity and create better opportunities for the poorest and particularly for women, &quot;which these loans are intended in particular.
&quot;We have already achieved a great deal&quot; and &quot;many challenges are still ahead of us.&quot;
Mikropůjčkách summit to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to promote the &quot;basic objectives&quot;.
Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families had access to financial services and to 100 million families above the poverty threshold, below which is currently live.
The concept of micro-loans to Spain and other countries of the world expanded after &quot;what&#39;s on this trip gave the idea a pioneer Muhammad Yunus,&quot; said the Queen, adding that it is&#39; a necessary act of justice and recognition. &quot;
Father of the instrument described as &quot;admirable idealist, who went the way of combating poverty.&quot; With his work, she met 15 years ago when he went to Bangladéže to be met on site with its policy loans.
After this experience, followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006. &quot;In all these meetings I was able to determine the constant development, explained the Queen, which, due to its support of this project yesterday earned the title of&quot; householder &quot;, which awarded her in Valladolid&quot; movement of the poor. &quot;
Queen Sofia ended his speech by calling on participants to engage in discussions and finding solutions, and thus enabled to continue the fight against poverty.
&quot;Ethical Imperative&quot;
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity &quot;is an ethical imperative&quot; to be used by all democratic states.
In this sense, said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries only with the period balohobytu, because such cooperation is a &quot;permanent duty.&quot;
Jiménez believes that microloans are &quot;serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty&quot;, and now more than ever, governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not to allow that solidarity was the victim of cuts.
For Micro-Spain is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept based on the fact that we trust the people to whom all other doors closed. The mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed the participants in the city, which &quot;opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity, which is contagious.&quot;
CDU proposes to elect a European president by universal suffrage
Without serious problems for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party chairwoman Angela Merkel took place on Monday 14 November in Leipzig, the first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU).
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the program, but it has to fall, especially to be satisfied with party members who believe that government policy towards Greeks today and maybe tomorrow against the Italians as lax.
The proposal on the President of the European Commission handed leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine out of 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
Few minutes of standing ovation at the end of Merkel&#39;s speech and then a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, a very pro-European finance minister, did not leave room for doubt.
The main idea of ​​Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up: the answer to the crisis &quot;is not less Europe, but more Europe.&quot;
Not only because Europe means peace, but because &quot;nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.&quot;
According to the Chancellor in Europe &quot;time has come for change.&quot;
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty enabling the EU to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of member countries euro area, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage &quot;in order to give Europe a face&quot;.
This is in each case one of the ideas adopted by Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly not unlikely that all twenty seven countries in this revolutionary step quick agrees: against the State of Great Britain and the leaders of the CDU holds that same position taken also Nicolas Sarkozy.
But the direction is defined.
Similarly, the large majority of delegates rejected a proposal to assess each country&#39;s weight in the Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of its economy, which obviously results in a strengthening of Germany&#39;s weight.
Driven by concerns to appease the climate inside his party, the Chancellor has made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But did not try to get Congress talk of &quot;small&quot; European countries or countries that are in trouble, willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of &quot;Franco-German friendship,&quot; Angela Merkel, France did not quote.
Only indirectly.
When reminded that it was two centuries ago took place at Leipzig bloody battle.
In fact it was one of the most humiliating defeats Napoleon&#39;s army.
What constitutes fraud in the incapacity?
After UMP party supports trigger and the government offensive against the working incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday 15 December in Bordeaux and visit the office for the provision of social support, which delivers the speech on the subject of recurring since 2007 on combating fraud and redistribution of social solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, based on savings will implement in the context of increased rigor, but is no less clear in terms of right-wing presidential campaign, most right-wing wants to focus on sick leave.
First, due to budgetary savings, the government intends to force private sector employees on the fourth day of incapacity before they take support in the disease.
Clearly, without the consent of the company employee who becomes ill, has lost four days wages, at least 15% of their monthly income.
The measures, which risks causing many bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos sheet could bring 280 million euros.
And the measure, which would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic hand: to give public employees not covered by one day sick leave (up to now have no failure over three days in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, also runs the most right-wing fraud theme this time focused on the abuses linked to work disability.
&quot;Checks will be much broader and more: if you get caught, you pay back,&quot; noted Xavier Bertrand in an interview with RTL on Sunday 13 of November.
Like in other cases, the effects seem to notice a somewhat disproportionate to the truth about the injustices of sick leave.
These were in fact under constant surveillance since 2002 and political onslaught that brought fruit.
The French are more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let&#39;s first of several official figures.
According to the Caisse nationale d&#39;assurance maladie (cname - the national health insurance) was paid in 2006, more than 237 million euros daily allowance.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in the health sector in 2008 accounted for per diem with its 11.3 billion euro 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount 46% of parent contributions and related occupational injuries and 54% were for sick leave, ie € 6.2 billion.
Thus, only 2.5% of the cost of health care.
According to a study group Alma Consulting had the French in 2010 averaged 14.5 days vs 17.8 sick leave days in 2009.
Average, which conceals a variation: another poll published in 2007 on the site dealing with jobs Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they did not select any day of incapacity.
Another study, this time made by health insurance institutions, states that in 2010 37.8% of sick leave was shorter than 8 days, 22% 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 within three months and 11% lasted longer.
When compared with their European neighbors, the French workers are more prone than others to work incapacity.
A long study conducted in 2010, two mA researchers CNRS (National Research Center) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total absence (health reasons or not) in France oscillated between 10% and 11.8% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating for sick leave is only a very small part compared to the work on black.
With regard to fraud, these are only minor.
Strengthening of legislation since 2002 meant that there are systematic inspections focusing on sick leave longer than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAME noted that the 1.5 million checks were 13.8% of the 285,000 made for short-term disability &quot;unjustified or too long&quot;, ie 37,050 cases.
In the event of failure to systematically controlled more than 45 days are counted 11% of cases &quot;nepřizpůsobených or unauthorized&quot; checks to 1.2 million, ie 132 000th
A total of 169,000 &quot;irregular&quot; cases for several million workers who had a disability.
A number that is much less than the number expressing the work on black.
According to Deputy Dominique Tiana UMP, author of the June report on this issue, this number would be represented 9 až € 15 billion in missing tax revenue per year, more than the total amount of daily compensation and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the last mentioned.
Papademos: Greece will have to apply the new bailout plan
Greece will need a new rescue program to renew its economy.
On Monday 14 December uttered these words before parliament Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said, adding that one hundred days of the unity of his government not to fulfill this task enough.
&quot;In order to re-build our economy on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and the new financial rescue plan,&quot; said Chief Minister when he spoke in the middle of his first public speech at the opening of debate on a vote of confidence in parliament.
Implementation of decisions adopted by the 27th October, when the euro area summit will be a &quot;major challenge&quot; the new government, because the game is the participation of our country in the euro area, he added.
As a result, Mr. Papademos assumed that the public deficit country will be from now until the end of the year &quot;around 9% of&quot; gross domestic product after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in The 2009th
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed its support for already approved measures to attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but warned that his party is under no obligation to any additional austerity measures.
&quot;For any new measures not lift a hand&quot;, said Samaras at a meeting with members of his party for New Democracy.
We have agreed targets for reducing the deficit and debt and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would hamper economic recovery.
Mr. Ollimu Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU unblock the necessary 8 billion euros loan without any written guarantees for all parties to support the measures envisaged, Antonis Samaras said that his word and that just will not sign anything under external pressure .
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says expert committee
According to the report of the Royal Canadian society is denied the death of Canadians.
In the case of palliative care committee urgently requires that governments, institutions and health care physicians working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society is the idea of ​​denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accepts the opportunity to talk with your doctor about conditions in which they want to die, and take decisions in this respect.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report of the Royal Canadian company, with the participation of six experts working in various areas, including the ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends the government to change the criminal law so as to permit assisted suicide and euthanasia, it appears if this option is exercised in a patient deemed competent to take such a decision.
At the beginning of experts cite a recent independent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries across the planet.
Although Canada is ranked 10th place, the study notes that &quot;the medicalization of death in Canada gave birth to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.&quot;
Medicalization of yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, communicated to us by experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian society.
And over the desire to die at home, which most Canadians, 68.6% of them dying in the hospital.
This average applies across Canada, while Quebec is the highest number with 86% of deaths in hospital.
With regard to the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report authors arrive at conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has said that the criminal law relating to euthanasia and assisted suicide will not change anything.
According to experts, who also underwent control all the countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered criminal case, there is no evidence that this causes some odkriminalizování abuse in the application, ie the practice of euthanasia and assisted suicide do not have jurisdiction to persons or disagreeing.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference over numerous cases of these missteps just in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized.
&quot;Euthanasia is performed in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.&quot;
&quot;Assisted suicide is carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,&quot; said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are supportive of euthanasia
Recall that according to surveys conducted Angus Reid Forum in 2010 to 85% of Canadians have called for euthanasia because they believe that allowing people to end life, relieve their suffering.
A 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we send the message that the life of old or disabled people have lower price.
As for persons who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those questioned believe that should not be prosecuted.
Concerning the maintenance or disruption of patient care, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also in the list of their recommendations suggest that in criminal law states that the withdrawal of treatment for which there is a legally confirmed rejection, is not punishable.
Commission experts also requires that medical specialists have been educated to respect the obligation to refuse medical treatment at the end of life without that fear of criminal prosecution.
In the case of palliative care committee urgently requires that governments, institutions and health care physicians working together to ensure the best palliative care and even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or definitive palliation already widely used in Canadian health care facilities requires the Commission to be considered when no longer used to reduce physical pain, for euthanasia and that subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of the other experts
Some medical experts have the right to express our reservations regarding the conclusions of expert reports of the Royal Canadian society.
Mr. Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified as experts-signatories of the report as &quot;extreme&quot; among other things, restrict the practice of euthanasia on the sick in the final stage.
&quot;This opens the door to a situation where everyone would be tired of life, which should more than 18 years, could ask to help him commit suicide,&quot; said Pierre Deschamps, who last studied the report summaries.
P. Deschamps also stressed that it looks as if the authors of the report opposed the autonomy of persons over all other values ​​that shape the social fabric of society.
For &quot;the company says there are warning signs and restrictions.&quot;
Specialist medical law Margaret Somerville also expressed &quot;strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which it characterized as a&quot; manifesto for euthanasia. &quot;
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian society, especially doubts about the data report on the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, ie in the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan&#39;s king calls for the resignation of President Assad
Damascus speaks of the &quot;plot&quot;
Syria is increasingly isolated
Followers of Bashar al-Assad rally yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday zintensivněly diplomatic pressure on Syria, President Bashar al-Assad to them with the support of Russia and is resistant to talk about &quot;conspiracy&quot; against his country.
Two days after the suspension of membership in the Syrian Arab League strengthened its European Union sanctions against Damascus, while Jordan and Turkey, countries bordering with Syria, a stand in favor of the departure of President Assad.
Jordan&#39;s King Abdullah II was the last ruler of the first Arab state, which called on President Bashar al-Assad, in Syria, where about forty civilians and members of the military regime were killed, &quot;handed over power&quot;.
&quot;If Bashar had at heart the interests of his country, he would resign, but he would also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,&quot; the king said Jordan, a country bordering with Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, Turkey&#39;s diplomacy chief Ahmet Davutoglu pity that Turkish mediation efforts devoted to the Syrian regime since the beginning of podnikanému been crowned with success.
&quot;Those who do not live in the Middle East at peace with his people and can not satisfy, you will lose,&quot; he said alluding to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey applies an increasingly harder line.
The United States rejoiced in &quot;strengthening the consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime dishonest conduct&quot; after the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
&quot;The international community, the United States, European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey applied increasingly tougher tone&quot; against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
As announced Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, during this time were killed in the city of Dera in the south of Syria, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces.
According to this NGO were killed two other civilians &quot;in the gunfights and concentrated fire from heavy machine guns in the city Jobar&quot; in Homs.
Yet at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem has estimated that the country is &quot;on her way out of crisis.&quot;
Other live reacted to the decision of the Arab League to suspend membership of Damascus, which he said is &quot;dangerous step&quot;.
Syria &quot;to bow down,&quot; he said with assurance that &quot;spinning plots against Syria will not succeed.&quot;
Following its decision to suspend the membership of Syria is currently pondering the League of Arab States &quot;mechanism for the protection of civilians&quot; and plans to send to the country&#39;s 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also in favor of the idea of ​​sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression mode, which according to him being &quot;paranoid.&quot;
New special meeting convened by the League for tomorrow in Rabat to take a position with a plan for resolving the crisis, decided on the second December, and especially where it was assumed withdrawal of armies from the strife-ridden cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrator.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday considered the decision of the League of Arab States for the &quot;bad&quot;, while China urged Syria to plan to resolve the crisis, but while completely avoiding support any sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time and sacrifice the Italians
The next head of the Italian government asked Mr. Monti markets for some time in order to form a team and begin your exercise program that will include a &quot;victim&quot; in order to regain lost credibility in recent months, Berlusconi&#39;s government.
Former European Commissioner yesterday discussed with political parties before they will meet today with representatives of trade unions and employers.
It should build relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats, not belonging to the parliamentary parties.
&quot;Monti spoke about an important program with many victims,&quot; ​​said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the nominee for prime minister.
Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini is expected that Mario Monti will ask parliament to Friday by a vote of confidence to make sure that the new government has enough support.
Consultation ends Mario Monti introduction of a small team of twelve ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti today commented on the nervousness in financial markets and asked them for time.
In &quot;Democracy pays the exact terms&quot; as regards the preparation of government and its program, stressed, adding that he is &quot;confident that markets will be patient and understand.&quot;
His appointment as president of the markets from the beginning was welcomed, but concerns re-emerged after an unexpected drop in September, industrial production in the euro area.
Appointed prime minister should assemble a team comprising mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like him to take the &quot;politics&quot;.
He expressed belief that the new government will last until 2013, the date the next election.
According to the President Gianfranco Fini&#39;s Deputies will trust the new government to parliament Friday.
Mario Monti after taking office promised to act with extreme urgency and in order for Italy to &quot;again become a powerful article&quot; Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that &quot;with the new administration, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change.&quot;
The European Union is convinced that Rome, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months has reached its goal of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for tough new measures.
Head of a business association Confindustria Emma Marcegagliová to meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy &quot;as a country that does not grow, can not comply with the parameters of the deficit.&quot;
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) renowned for their expertise and independence, &quot;Professor&quot; symbolizing editorials according to the authors &#39;call for seriousness &quot;and&quot; other Italy &quot;, is for Italy,&quot; epochal change &quot;after 17 years&#39; berlusconismu&quot; .
The big unknown is the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as in Italy in April 2012 has put the state bonds worth 200 billion euros.
Soviet scientist helped Iran&#39;s nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator usable for nuclear weapons, announced on Tuesday an American non-governmental organization specialized in nuclear risk.
Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) to identify the scientists based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency.
Last week, the IAEA said its &quot;grave concern&quot; regarding &quot;possible military dimension&quot; to Iran&#39;s nuclear program.
According to the Institute ISIS widely from drawing on the IAEA documents V. Danilenko (b. 1934) had to work three decades since the sixties in the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Urals), where he was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 had to leave the center, in Kiev based company producing &quot;nano-diamonds.&quot;
Economic difficulties his company had to bring him to contact in 1995 Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Before returning to Russia should then work from 1996 to 2002, the Iranian program.
In its latest report, the IAEA notes &quot;clear indications that the development of detonation Iran conducted&quot; based &quot;on the work of foreign experts, who not only knew well this method, but that - how about one Member State has informed the agency - to work during a substantial part of their career working on this technology in the country&#39;s military nuclear program, where it comes from. &quot;
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday the number of crimes and offenses aimed against Muslims has increased since 2009 until 2010, nearly 50%, while at the same time other racial and religious violence slightly decreased or slightly increased.
According to these figures the total number of atrocities committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, ie 49% increase compared to the procedure by 13% for violence against Catholics, a decrease of 4% for offenses against the Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and offenses.

&quot;After a loss in 2009 is disturbing to see these crimes and delinquencies rise again,&quot; emphasized by Human Rights First Human rights, &quot;increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly important,&quot; she said, in their communique.
&quot;Human Rights First long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes must be considered a serious violation of human rights&quot;, says one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Legendre.
&quot;The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses,&quot; he adds, estimating that this could be achieved by improving the police report about &quot;hate criminal acts.&quot;
&quot;Hate crime offense&quot; in U.S. federal law, the legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King, to punish acts of violence related to race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more similar to Facebook
This page provides microblogging service Twitter on Monday introduced a change in design to allow its users to observe the activities of successors, which is somewhat similar to that of its service Facebook.
New offers &quot;business&quot; and &quot;name&quot; to better know and direct the activities of other people who follow you, or people whose answers (&quot;tweets&quot;) are following you.
This makes it possible to know if you track contributions, whether they log on to the new accounts that have popular posts, etc.
The new face of Twitter has been tested &quot;in August in a small percentage of users&quot; before it was extended on Monday to the entire network, told AFP spokeswoman Carolyn Penner Twitter.
Twitter, which was little known for his instinctive operation, with a somewhat unintelligible terms (RT for repeated spreading someone else&#39;s post, recommander followfriday pour un autre de suivre utilisateur) le bonheur des faisant initiés, s&#39;ouvre Ainsi and un plus large public avec un maniement plus a comparable cell des Réseaux grand public Google + Facebook et.
Users on the network as soon as their &quot;tweets&quot; differently assess the importance of this innovation.
&quot;It is unnecessary, takes up this much space and too much like Facebook,&quot; writes @ jemb123.
&quot;Function activity will help me better watch some elements of my Twitter&quot; @ dannykronstrom sent.
Austria
entering a golden rule of a balanced budget to the Constitution
Grand coalition government of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to register the &quot;golden rule&quot; of fiscal policy into the Constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrades by rating agencies of Austria (AAA).
He was a social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann, who announced the decision at the conclusion of meetings of ministers in a situation where the Austrian public debt, with its 74.6% above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht agreement, but much lower than countries such as debts Italy, Greece or Spain.
&quot;If the solvency of Austria was reduced by only a single step from AAA to AA +, we would pay in interest each year by more than three billion euros,&quot; argued Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, a Christian Democrat Michael SPINDELEGGER.
Austria continues the request of the euro area summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where Heads of State and Government strongly requested by the end of 2012 was to reduce the public deficit and achieve a balance of public accounts recorded in the Constitution or law to the same value.
Instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching &quot;German model&quot;, Germany was the first European country to a &quot;rule&quot; was adopted.
The year 2017 will have a public structural deficit each year fall of 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, starting in 2017 public structural deficit of the federal state would be allowed each year shall not exceed 0.35% of GDP, while the Länder and municipalities, will need to have a balanced budget.
The aim is to get in years 2020/21 public debt below 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Strong yen
Noda there is a new intervention in the foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yošihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions have once again intervene in foreign exchange markets, if they had only to continue to strengthen.
&quot;Hit, as we did last time, if we find excessive volatility&quot; in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, rose again only to historical values ​​that 31st October forced the Japanese authorities to intervene.
That day Tokyo sold yen for dollars in order to decrease the value of Japanese currency, which only recently overcame a valid record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then has regularly supported by rising purchases of investors who view him as a &quot;safe haven&quot; in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the crisis caused by debt.
The dollar on Tuesday again came under 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar value of around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
The Japanese currency harms Flash island exports more expensive because the price of products made in Japan and reduces the value of income derived from abroad by Japanese companies when converted into domestic currency.
&quot;Japan is recovering&quot; from the destruction caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, emphasized Y. Noda, who fears that the rise in the yen did not kill the eggs still fragile recovery.
The third economic power in the world renewed in the third quarter growth (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year due to export growth and a survey of household consumption burdened disaster.
But Prime Minister concluded that the high value of the yen, reflect the &quot;national economy of Japan.&quot;
Japanese Finance Minister called on Jun Azumi Bank of Japan (BoJ), which launched on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its monetary policy and the Council to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguči this institution pointed out that the BoJ has already adopted the &quot;appropriate measures&quot; to suggest that no additional monetary depreciation is not expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October Institute for issuance increased by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) of its purchases of government treasury bills and increased to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion) ceiling amounts to spending on purchases of various securities in order to flooded with liquidity.
Eurozone:
rates rise, fail Exchange
The risk of contracting the debt crisis still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, and better growth figures in France and Germany, countries rates weakened continue their growth.
European shares are still concerned because the stability of the euro area is now on Tuesday 15 November falling into negative expectations.
In Paris in 10 hours CAC 40 index lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt lost 0.4%, 0.1% in London.
&quot;With the new tensions around the proceeds of the loans in the euro area that are in trouble, continue to equity markets around the world bring in only part of the recent gains.&quot;
&quot;Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,&quot; explains Terry Pratt, broker IG Markets, cited by Reuters.
Tokyo Stock Exchange is closed with a decrease of 0.7%, which has suffered due to concerns of market participants about Europe&#39;s ability to deal with debt crises.
&quot;Japan as well as the rest of the world&#39;s eyes on Europe and the relay will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations, while investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized,&quot; estimates Mitsušige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoši Investment Management.
The relaunch of uncertainties about the future of the euro area itself damages the currency, which on Tuesday continued its decline.
Euro is now at its lowest level since last month and a half.
In 10 hours the value of European currency at 1.3570 dollar decline by 0.4%.
According to brokers currency retreated after the CDU party of Chancellor Angela Merkel at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal envisaging the possibility of exit from the euro area for countries that find themselves in trouble, so without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very alarming rate.
This morning on Tuesday, Italian ten-year bond yield reached 6.85% and ten-year Spanish bonds yield is 6.2%.
The voltage applied to the interest rate southern European countries, but also in France, continues to reinforce fears of market participants.
Future head of the Italian government Mario Monti strongly demanded in the markets time to correct the situation in Italy at risk of poisoning caused by the amount of debt.
New Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos confirmed that the implementation of decisions taken by the 27th October, when the euro area summit will be the &quot;main task&quot; of his government.
Spain is located in a deliberate re-line markets, when the country held elections on Sunday in the House of Commons.
Rate difference (&quot;spread&quot;) between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of the euro zone growth figures notifying
Statistical figures say that France has seen in the third quarter economic growth of 0.4% caused mainly by household consumption, ie, slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised downwards, however, figures for the second quarter to decline by 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And the truth is that the fourth quarter, economists are most concerned about.
For its part, Germany during the same period registered a growth of 0.5%.
Initial estimates for the euro area are expected in 11 hours, while the European Commission has just highlighted the risk of new recession.
Energy Policy:
facts must prevail over dogma
If there is an issue that can not be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or the emotions, it&#39;s energy policy.
Availability and price of electricity has a direct impact on purchasing power and competitiveness.
It is natural that the election meeting was an opportunity to think about such deposits, and the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all explore the economic, social and environmental consequences of proposed options.
The French must establish its position on objective facts and rational data.
Meanwhile on the planet&#39;s seven billion human beings, but from now on demographic causes doubling by 2050 demand for electricity, if we do not want much of the world population to get rid of an important part of life.
At the same time will be faced scarcity of fossil resources, in order to continue to produce electricity, and it can not forget the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from the environmental debate.
The accident in Fukušimě does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear power.
But this is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decisions need to find some other source capable of replacing itself or Switzerland, which considers only the right to build power plants last generation.
On the contrary, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote a few countries, with a determination to continue in their projects.
The United States has for Fukušimě decided to expand its fleet by one unit restoring a power plant construction suspended after the accident of Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energies, sometimes presented as an example that contradicts reality.
The choice of Berlin to show increase in the cost of electricity prices, increased energy dependency on imported gas from Russia in particular, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by construction of power plants to natural gas and coal.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to think over it.
European champion in the wind, which removes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumer of coal and gas because of irregularities in the wind, making the emissions of CO2 and the Danish electricity prices increased by 65%, respectively. 50%, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the permanence of our energy policy, our neighbors to pay electricity bills by 40% higher than the payment amounts to French households.
While in the globalized economy, energy costs are a key factor in maintaining competitiveness and security industry in the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would create a strong increase in electricity prices that would make a beautiful statement of illusory re-industrialization of our country and defend the purchasing power.
The price that a large majority of the French refused to pay, as well as in principle not opposed to this energy, as shown by opinion polls.
Recall that our country&#39;s energy policy has enabled the industry to build 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 related jobs.
Strong exporting industry for dragging on the international markets a large number of specialized small and medium enterprises that generate jobs, which can not be transferred abroad.
If France has decided to leave the core, sacrificed by a considerable number of small and medium enterprises and came to 6 billion per year that the country receives for exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which owner ordered power plants to nuclear reactor designed to operate 60 years, while it was scheduled to decline by its manufacturer?
In solving the energy equation must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, and even that there is not no devil.
Development of facilities producing low CO2 emissions, nuclear power plants and renewable sources of energy carried by the French industrial group AREVA suggests complementarity of energy sources.
If nuclear power is an absolute necessity to maintain the highest level of security.
In France we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which performs rigorous and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of new power plant in Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is recognized, they have the idea of ​​safety in the blood.
For fifty years the nuclear industry saw three serious accidents.
Only in the Three Mile Island occurred in conditions of normal operation and remained without human casualties and environmental consequences.
The drama caused by the Chernobyl reactor design and inexcusable human error.
For Fukushima, it seems that some forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
Nuclear industry takes lessons from this accident, just as it did in the previous two.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between French and German authorities, dealing with nuclear safety, operators and designers is that the EPR type reactor concept is capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all candidates who wish to build a nuclear power plant, to consider it, stop its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift offered by competitors Areva and EDF&#39;s release and travel to seize the leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate search for the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, and the machinations of dogma dominated the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
It is a burden for the economy or immigration chances?
Immigration policy implemented in Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion, police, judiciary and administration, subject to policy numbers, compatibility of this policy, the status of &quot;country of human rights,&quot; which boasts France.
Recently it has been the administrative harassment, which were the subject of foreign students, which has become current, when the Minister of the Interior (see list of Libération, 23 May) said that France &quot;does not need foreign talent, bricklayers and waitresses.&quot;
But so far only rarely been analyzed under the angle of the economy.
Needless to say, that in this area are fairly broad consensus between left and right.
To the right tone in 1976 Jacques Chirac gave his statement that &quot;900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers&quot; and Michel Rocard on the left, when in 1990 he said that France &quot;can not receive all the misery of the world &quot;.
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of invasion hordes of Polish plumbers to French territory shared by right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that uráčíme immigrants provide.
In his program, François Hollande limited to banalities, he indicates that the joint development will solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;.
This idea of ​​immigration as a burden and a problem in the elections are possible, but economically it is very expensive.
How reminiscent of economists, Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in his recently published work syntetizujícím latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.): among specialists there is broad consensus on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration paralyzes growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impacts of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those less qualified, and create downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more than adding replacements for French workers, by working in the sectors with a lack of staff.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that attracted the French workers, and those skilled in the most dynamic sectors in which the offer is not enough training places.
Positive effect on wages
Like the surgeon will be able to work in a country where lack of anesthetists, the addition of French migrants and cause the arrivals of immigrants have a positive effect on wages and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri so calculated that the increase in migratory movements of 1% causes a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that immigrants bringing diversity contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants in the American Nobel Prize winners, Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were established immigrants).
Migrants are also in European countries, net contributor of social systems, an average of 1% of the total budget.
World Labour Organisation estimates the instance that an immigrant in Germany came at the age of 30 years will bring your entire life to public budgets net contribution (revenue minus expenses) € 150,000.
Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at the beginning of his mandate, he wishes to be absent percent growth &quot;with teeth&quot;.
These teeth serve to discourage immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, European democracy remains to rethink
Democracy is too precious and fragile goods.
The continent would have to remember, for despite her in Athens two thousand years ago invented, experienced over XX. Tragedy century world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also in Franco&#39;s Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some people may believe that the fact that democracy finally triumphed over their enemies, the choice will be sufficient to carry out and implement it as the most direct way.
He knows, however, since Napoleon, it was a ease of mind.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, not a condition sufficient and can become &quot;an instrument of oppression&quot; as a philosopher once said Republican Vacherot Etienne.
No, democracy requires much more: the public space, public spirit, values, organization and control of the power department, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe, the experience is the economic crisis, but it is just the beginning of the crisis and the politics and democracy.
Admitting to a mistake of the Greek referendum of yes-no this will be the value of dual-direction detection: detection of necessity of a large return of political power, but also reveal the disturbing sense of his inability, his impropriety.
This ambivalence must be considered in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front line of the democratic struggle are now displaced and many of the Republican fighters have not shot in the right direction.
We can not get anything if we require a number of national referendums organized by necessity and disorganized.
Blank exposed absolutistickému European monarch or jump to their feet bound in the depths of space nationalist: what choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want the guillotine blade, but a common, full, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is a crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - nor indeed had we not know where to stop the list - it is a crisis in Europe.
It is a Europe bent dictates the markets and rating agencies, which suffer from their incompetence and their lack of solidarity.
It is a Europe that is humiliated on the international scene.
Disturbed during the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it&#39;s a Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and each of its nations.
Urgent need to return control of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
For only together can reduce the severity Europeans of their debt, get rid of government markets and prepare the future of investing.
The exit from the crisis will assume the decision at European level that can not be accepted without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
Once we have long fought against this proposal Socialists and Jacques Delors, today all require strong European economic government.
So be it.
But to think that without strong political integration and democratic, and lived as a citizen, it would be folly and a new a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order for the Republic in France, it was necessary &quot;to be&quot; Republicans.
Revolution in the interests not to do.
These lessons are still valid.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
It will only be able to make the construction of Europe more politically democratic and truly European democratic sovereignty.
We become Europeans, we have built Europe.
&quot;Contactless&quot; smart cards are spreading
The optimistic atmosphere, opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris World Fair of Smart Cards.
The year 2011 should end up under the Cabinet Eurosmart increase global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with SIM card) by 11% to over 6 billion units.
Most of the segment is supporting contactless technology that allows you to pay in the public transport system to handle purchases or just approaching the card reader.
This year should be sold around the world 460 million smart cards sold against 320 million meters a year earlier!
They should share in 2012 still stand (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the market with smart cards (6,925,000 cards).
After a long tow in the APEC countries, Europe gaining ground in contactless payment.
Approximately 26 million bank cards, Visa is already equipped with this feature and 75,000 POS terminals is accepted.
In France, more modest beginnings: it was issued 400,000 Visa contactless cards.
But large chain stores operate under two.
Carrefour this year and issued 2.5 million contactless cards MasterCard Pass.
To move up a gear, it is necessary that from now on the bank recalled them to their clients.
&quot;Two large French companies have undertaken to systematically distribute to their clients in the future contactless bank cards,&quot; announces Nébouy Gérard, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payment
But this is only the first stage of the paying agent of the future: the mobile phone.
NFC (Near Field Communication) required for transactions is now equipped with only a small number of devices.
&quot;He took a delay.&quot;
&quot;But the real boom should occur next year.&quot;
&quot;For 2012 we estimate their sales in the world 80 to 120 million units,&quot; said Marc Bertin, president Eurosmart.
But banks are already preparing in advance.
The bank Crédit Agricole today announced the launch of the test conducted in the city of Caen, which runs from December to June next year.

Terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris concerned about links between Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected that there are bundles of terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and Niger sect Boko Haram is confirmed.
On Sunday, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Algerian Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that from Algiers about now &quot;gained confidence.&quot;
&quot;The way the two organizations operate, and intelligence reports show that between them there is great cooperation,&quot; he explained, without further clarification.
It seems that Paris has a similar analysis.
Investigation of the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being kidnapped by members of AQMI one restaurant in Niamey should be Antoine de Léocour Vincent Delory and killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the intervention had the French and Nigerian investigators found several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis carried out leads to call several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) particularly interested in investigating two numbers: one leads to the Nigerians, who long resided in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, which is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other a man, which it says is close to AQMI and sect.
&quot;It&#39;s progress, but it should certainly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.&quot;
&quot;But it&#39;s possible.&quot;
&quot;We know for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support, and that manifests itself more and more actively,&quot; moderates statements Nigerian Kunle Amuwo investigator.
In recent months, this &quot;support&quot; more and more evident in the development and manifestations Boko Haram or its operating procedures to include human sacrifices from now or ever more sophisticated explosive devices of the same modus operandi, such as devices used by organizations AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account issues raised by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, long regarded as a community group of enlightened mystics little worthy of interest.
Flying start
Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around mosques, schools and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which means in the language haoussa &quot;Western education is sin&quot;, approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the rapid success of such a connection.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic Sharia law, while her supporters start fighting proti&#39;ústřední government.
These people focus first on churches, bars and offices.
In 2009, followers of Boko Haram become extremely active and multiply their attacks against police stations.
The government&#39;s response is still the same as usual.
The army surrounded the city and the result is 800 dead.
The sect&#39;s founder Mohammed Yusuf is caught and killed in prison.
Since then, the group leaves the radicalized and their whereabouts in the north.
At Christmas 2010, the assassination in Jos, in which 80 people are killed, then another in the capital Abuja.
In June, again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attack on police headquarters during its first suicide attack.
And in August the United Nations local offices, the first international target.
Create a terrorist axis in Africa, which should result from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, from now on all security specialists worried.
Now when Al-Qaeda Islamic Maghreb and Mali surrounded Iger and Somalis from the movement of Al-Sababa operate in Kenya, the Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of readiness and is prepared to &quot;hand over all information.&quot;
The World According to presidential candidates
In matters relating to China, Iran or Israel to help Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplifying and ignorance.
America can manage crises weakened the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
While listening to the presidential candidates would have voters think.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other repeated loud statements and concise guidance on foreign policy, which is traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran or Israel to help blend with each other.
Mitt Romney, umisťující best candidate in the race for the Republican nomination &quot;Grand Old Party&quot;, threatened the Chinese occupation before the World Trade Organisation and the charges &quot;because of their currency manipulation,&quot; which is the main topic in America turbulent migration of whole sections of industry towards Asia.
Even worse, if this in itself must contain start a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama&#39;s former ambassador to China, and the only candidate having a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, nearly caught in the position to be &quot;smoothed&quot; emotions.
It required tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current stance of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of estimates in the election remains neposlouchatelný.
The image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, we confine Iran,&quot; said fanfarónsky.
&quot;If re-elected, Obama will have a bomb.&quot;
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama that failed in their responsibilities towards the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best umístivší candidate demonstrates an embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
Recently called for a sharp stance against China&#39;s military threat because Beijing &quot;trying to develop nuclear capability&quot; - evidently ignorant of the fact that China&#39;s own nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike against Iran, says of himself that he is ready to send U.S. forces into Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against terrorists banned expected in Obama 2009 is also recommended Cain, Perry and other candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all much else than it was in 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents say the current president that Reagan also had a simple idea and yet won the Cold War.
They point out that Obama himself was an amateur and that added water to their wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of the naive dialogue with Iran, hasty departure &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his excuses for him by Libya and attach the label weak
But the attack is not easy.
Population review national security policy of President Obama, who removed the Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq does not trust the military interventions that lead to a quagmire.
And the argument that it is necessary to reconstruct America economically, in order to resuscitate its leadership, knocking Obama on correct place.
Nord Stream, a new input port of Russian gas to Europe
Remote Nord Stream pipeline directly linking Russia to Eastern Europe and driven by the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It must deliver gas equal to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including 4 heads of state and government attended the inauguration last Tuesday Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects directly beneath the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch colleague Mark Rutte turned around together control the valve control input of Russian gas to western grid.
This new pipeline will begin to flow each year into Western Europe, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas pipe of the first 1,224 km connecting the region with the Land of St. Petersburg Mecklembursko-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which must be completed at the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, an amount equal to the entire French consumption.
And already the third points to build gas pipelines on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge character building victory.
Project strongly protested against Poland and the Baltic countries.
Nord Stream will actually deliver gas directly to Germany without that would be handled by a third country after country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, the two countries are losing a bit of power: the possibility of threats to put pressure on Russia to shut him access to Western markets for them becomes more difficult.
Warsaw&#39;s most strongly expressed, did not hesitate when compared to the Nord Stream &quot;new German-Soviet Pact&quot;, referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in the occupation of Poland in The 1939th
Does it say that it is politically sensitive topic.
Western Europe by supporting this project in the Russian won him more confident of their purchases.
But is this the price weakened Europe&#39;s energy, because the project created a rift between Europeans from the east and west.
Russia managed to barely 5 years ago to promote his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries with high consumption of gas, whose deposits are nearing the end.
&quot;This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically,&quot; Francois Fillon has confirmed at the ceremonial opening of the pipeline and demonstrated, at what point the gas contracts are big things both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles Gazprom leaders present in large numbers in Lubmin, place of supply of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical offense.
Bottom line is equipped with steel concrete casing to protect it from ships anchors.
Rests on the seabed at an average depth of 200 m
During its construction it was necessary to avoid the mine fields originating from the time of second World War II.
&quot;For safety, they almost had to be removed or destroyed by the hundred,&quot; said Jens Mueller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It should also increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The very long metal pipe like a snake weighing 242 Eiffelovek appropriated for its entire length is never interrupted or valves or stations of maintenance.
One control platform should be built close to Sweden, but it rejected the project manager, when the Swedes were just a little eager to see the Russian state company, how to permanently settle in their coasts.
&quot;In case of failure stop the passage of gas in less than 1 minute&quot;, states Jens Müller.
In case of leakage gas contained in gas escapes into the air.
But this case is considered a builder unlikely, for welds was designed so that the leak was once in 100,000 years.
Check the status of the pipeline outside performs underwater robot driven organizations, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the interior of pipe and is pushed gas.
At the finish after three days of travel speed of 3 m / s will provide accurate information on any deformation of metal parts.
Remote gas pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without the slightest need to fix.
Gas circulation is simply to ensure pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar and 100 bar starting at the finish.
For this project, five companies have joined forces.
Leadership remains Gazprom, which holds 51% share.
To him join the German company E.ON and BASF (15.5% each) and Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called Nord Stream responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug in Switzerland, where tax is extremely convenient.
Gazprom then the company has leased for five years contract, which may be renewed, all of its capacity to transport gas.
&quot;Gazprom will have a total capacity of profit, whatever the real amount of any of the gas,&quot; explains Jens Müller.
Financing construction of the pipeline to ensure 30% of the shareholders and 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipes.
For a group GDF Suez and investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they return their costs, because risk takes only Gazprom.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea coast on the sandy Lubmin with pine woods.
The valves are 4.5 meters high gate output gas.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday the terminal receives an hourly one million cubic meters of Russian gas.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6000000.
Moleskine - branded notebook
Moleskine Italian company, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to give back the joy of writing.
With taste adventure, spent hours writing by candlelight.
Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by their black rectangular plates with leaves and faded colors like white zestárlými time.
For Moleskine notebook, such as we know it today was born already in 1997.

Why is such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
Around 19% of disabled people seeking work.
Today opens 15th Week for employing the handicapped.
Through proactive public policy established in 2005, the percentage of unemployed disabled persons more times higher than the average, ie 19% versus 9% for the whole population.
It&#39;s depressing?
&quot;No, underscores Éric Blanchet, CEO of Adapt, which organizes Week for employing the handicapped.&quot;
&quot;Progress achieved in 15 years are remarkable.&quot;
&quot;At that time the percentage of unemployed was not twice but three times.&quot;
&quot;However, it remains much to do.&quot;
It should be noted that for unemployed disabled people are still numerous obstacles before they start work.
This is an older person: 37% have more than 50 years (17% on average).
They have few qualifications: 80% have high school diploma and 2.3 million university students is only 10 000 handicapped.
And finally - long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% vs. 38% disabled in diameter.
In short, such are the criteria that are especially complicated by the return to work and who represent the &quot;core issue&quot;, according to Christian Grapina, CEO Tremplin Association, founded in 1992 to assist businesses to adopt handicapped workers.
So in terms of objective brakes.
Left unsaid, ways of thinking which will certainly evolve, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April-IMS Entreprendre Association pour la Cité found that the respondents are managers&#39; poor level of knowledge about handicapped persons &quot;with&quot; an exaggerated image of persons in a wheelchair and psychological or mental deficiencies. &quot;
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching that goal to employ handicapped workers 6% specified in the Act of 1987.
Last known numbers that come out of the year 2008, indicate the status equal to 2.6%.
&quot;Now is around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of the organization responsible for collecting Agefiph fees from businesses that do not comply with this law.
The proof is the number of &quot;fined&quot; businesses, as well as the amount paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 the offending companies to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, explains Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But this improvement and also demonstrates a real awareness, particularly in large enterprises.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.

Portugal very confident
The Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts with great optimism play-off tie against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there both teams lacked realism.
&quot;At the end of 90 minutes we will be happy team and happy above all the earth.&quot;
Paulo Bento has already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him there is no shadow of doubt. Portuguese football team with whose helm since 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal away from happiness, in fact, 90 minutes.
It remains to play one game and one opponent - Bosnia.
Being aware of Friday&#39;s outcome (0-0) in Zenica Bosnia hell, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had superiority over an hour, but was not able to give such a rare goal, which would relieve him.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which in itself carries a risk, however, because we did not give out Socket.&quot;
But at home on their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that the forward front of an audience that there was a boiling cauldron, although the game definitely seems to be &quot;very balanced,&quot; says an optimist, but shrewdly thinking Bento.
&quot;We expect a very tight game, but we are quite confident that we can have the upper hand,&quot; said the Portuguese coach dvaačtyřicetiletý.
&quot;We still have 50% chance to be at Euro 2012&quot;, but qualified the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
Friday&#39;s tie game in Bosnia forced the Portuguese score goals and win.
Undecided match may suffice Bosnians who also need to score goals.
&quot;It&#39;s a good result, which in itself carries a risk, however, because we did not give out gola,&quot; regrets Bento.
&quot;We are playing against a team that has great technical quality, which has players with great individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica will develop an interest in Portuguese Bosnian team right from the beginning of the maximum pressure to &quot;not give them time to think.&quot;
Good idea, provided that this time turns out to be realistic.
