Lack of snow on the mountains haunts the hotel owners 
Scneelose Pisten Sorgenn make not only the giant mountains-local residents. 
The lack of snow discourages people from appointment of Skiaufenthalte in hotels and pensions. 
It can Therefore in Giant still free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve. 
Our pages are often visited. 
People go through the offers, the prices, but now they have fear, binding. 
And if they call us immediately, whether we believe this year's Christmas on snow or "Matsch" will be the operator of the information portal Spindl. Info, Martin Jandura. 
The New Year's Eve-stay in the Spindelmühle just after his ideas, should no longer hesitate with the appointment. 
Anyone who prefers saving and the quality of the stay in second place, which can try to wait a few days. 
The Spindelmühle hotel owners offer now for the New Year's Eve day mostly just weeks stays. 
I think that they are still for a while to sell it, but then they must also give in and for shorter periods. 
And then the free rooms quickly languishing Jandura estimated. 
Free beds in all winter dates is always, always the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi. 
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet sold out. 
In our offer is about half the seats are still free. 
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas visits to the last moment, the director of the travel agents Ingtours, Petr Schiefert. 
The Silvestertag in Giant can offer The Vrchlabi-travel agency, but there are fewer free seats. 
Good (also find the first 14 days in February, the rest of the winter dates are sold on average. 
This year is the interest for the winter were also negatively affected by that in Giant always no snow. 
The People are waiting to see whether snow falls. 
No one wants to spend the end of the year without snow in the mountains. 
Should the runways within a week verschneit, will also be sold out this Christmas, says Schiefert. 
Conversely, and slightly better than in last year, manages the rooms in the hotel horizon in Pecpod Snezkou to fill. 
We are about five percent better than in the previous year. 
On Silvestertag and at Christmas we only have a few free room. 
There is great interest in the Polish holiday in Janua, and in February, will run the business well, the director of the best Pec-hotels, Karel Rada. 
About 80 percent for the New Year's Eve stays is also the Omnia Hotel in central parking in Janske Lazne occupied. 
However, to Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne even half the beds free. 
Pleasantly surprised us in January this year, for which we are currently at around 60 percent occupied. 
A bit is weaker now the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, is the interest in the periods spent in Giant, the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch. 
On a more snow bescherung awaiting the Giant hotel owners now. 
On Thursday, it should cool and if it comes to rainfall, should be the snow On the mountains. 
But then again to a warming, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove. 
United States: repetition is the mother of wisdom 
It is almost comical, with what Schülerstrebsamkeit Barack Obama, the President with his reputation of the brightest, the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue repeated that he himself for the Dümmsten. 
When he finally his anxiously awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it emerged that he abschrieb this on the Kopierpapier from the Bush-Iraq Szenariovor three years ago. 
Not only that, in the text itself, he used the phrase "as in Iraq," he has even used the name of the Bush statement in January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Vorwärtsweg" without the fence. 
He has even three years ago, the Bush idea - fresh troop contributions in the troubled by the civil war in Iraq - as "irresponsible and in their conclusions karastrophische decision ". 
Subsequent months showed, however, that the recommendations of the military outgoing Bush, the only possible strategy and was very successful, that it is in the news about Iraq. 
The Bush's reputation has not improved by objectively, because he has left his successor a much dankbarere starting situation, as it was to be expected. 
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle repeatedly. 
In order to increase the contingent have asked the military, especially the Oberkommandeur the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, even despite the Subordinationsgewohnheiten vacillating harshly criticized in the White House. 
He called for 40, 000 soldiers in order to reverse the situation for the better. 
The President postponed three months, but with no better idea and he has betrayed The General wenistens about 10, 000 soldiers. 
From Europe, has the promise of another 5, 000, even if he at least 10, 000. 
Highly problematic in the Obama strategy is its plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and this process within three years. The whole Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers. 
Some doubt that the increase in the same effect as the measure in Iraq. 
Also, despite the fratricidal war in recent years, the Iraqi society relatively well structured, their leaders pay tribute to the values. 
The Afghan situation is characterised by the cons indication - on no one can leave and there are no agreements. 
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used every day to change their mind. 
The political institutions, even if they were established formally correct, that leaves only bogus construction, behind which the patriarchal tribe relations further. 
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, particularly because of the confusion of the conditions that the Pakistan and Iran influences even more complex. 
The building of a "strong state ", which is the minimalist objective of the whole operation is very unrealistic. 
Time horizon of the Obama strategy surprised by his voluntarism 
Over the last eight years has worsened the situation in Afghanistan and now it is on the verge of explosion. 
We believe that the small soldiers broke out in the war cry on the "early" create a miracle, can only a truly romantic soul, is not influenced by facts. 
From the political point of view is the date for the withdrawal of troops sheer irresponsibility, because the Taliban as the indirect confession of American defeat. 
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the combat in Afghanistan, is running out. 
Europe's politicians cannot and do not want their voters also, the security of Germany or Italy with the war in the Hindu Kush gebirgsvorland. 
Another possible factor that can influence the situation radically, is the development of events in Iran. 
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, the United States is a very serious question of whether the problem is not with troops. 
This question must be answered in the period in which America after Obama the winner is withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation. 
The only consolation plaster for Barack Obama is the fact that three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time, so that he can resort to a different strategy, fallls would prove to be a total loss. 
The managers of the bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses more in cash 
The chief executives of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs received no bonuses this year more bonuses in cash. 
The company has announced that the to the sharp criticism of its pay practices. 
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, but they can sell in five years. 
In addition, the shares the managers in the case will be withdrawn if they act too risky. 
Goldman Sachs is so according to the Reuters news agency at the forefront of efforts, the premium bonuses of Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance. 
I believe that the Wall Street on further direction is aware, in which she has to go, the former banker of the society, Douglas Elliott. 
The problem is in the details, he added. 
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after she had for the first three quarters of this year, almost $17 billion for bonuses bonuses. 
The total amount of bonuses in the course of this Jahra, according to the Reuters news agency reported today despite the measure exceed $20 billion. 
The high premiums bonuses in the banking sector, with the start of the financial crisis in a whole series of Länders has become the hottest political issue. 
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to the bonuses of bankers who exceed the 25, 000 pounds, unique with a tax of 50 percent. 
Similar steps are also preparing for France.

In addition to the four women scientists was under the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller, including. 
The Nobel Prize for medicine have two American Biologinnen, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her compatriot Jack Szostak Chromosonen for research in the area. 
The prize for chemistry has the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for clarification of the Ribosom structure and function. 
The last Laureatin awarding the Nobel Prize for economics, the American, Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analyses of the economic report. 
The only specialist category, in which no woman in this year received a Nobel Prize in physics. 
This prize today, the scientists Charles Kao for research in the glass fibre-area and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD-chip-invention, which is the basis of all Digitalkammeras, fax machines or astronomical long-distance pipes. 
Each prize has the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and certificate on the acquisition of the prize money. 
The totals in each category of ten million Swedish kronor. 
If there are several winners in each category, the price of money will be divided among them. 
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo. 
He acknowledged in his speech the Kontrovere his appointment, because He is only the beginning of his journey, and in addition to the tip of the country, the two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
In respect of his policy, but he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the Erkämpfen of world peace, even if the price is high. 
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus has invited him into the castle 
President Vaclav Klaus on Friday morning at the finance minister, Eduard Janota, about his continued presence in the government, because it with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form in which this by the Assembly on Wednesday was released, does not agree. 
It is thought that the budget and perhaps also the continued presence of Janota cabinet the themes of the meeting. 
The budget will also criticised by Klaus. 
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which deepened the crisis in public finances. 
On the meeting of the presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat. 
On its future remain in his post wants Janota on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, negotiate. 
After the Budget bill, which is now receiving Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic with a deficit of 163 billion kronor. 
In Parliament, but on Wednesday on the Left Party proposals on monetary upheaval and the money for the civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and direct wages of farmers. 
The government has the proposals of social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit. 
Between the Left Party, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus and legal Party, on the other hand, is therefore a sharp domestic political dispute, dessentwegen the question mark over the future work of the Fischer-official cabinet, on which the ODS and CSSD and Green Party have agreed in the spring. 
Critics claim that the budget, as it was approved by Parliament, the package of austerity measures practically liquidated by the fishermen have been imposed in the autumn, and the government of the public debt. 
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but not, said today the discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs that the politicians of the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances have neglected, a longer period of time. 
In his opinion, there is no good solution. 
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which still on a broader consensus among the political parties could build. 
The ODS, Mirek Topolanek, led to that the budget is terrible, and the government should consider their continued existence. 
The deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of official cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works. 
Premier Fischer described in the editorial similar words as a "strong worry." 
The CSSD leader, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek-words that the budget deficit is terrifying, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion kronor. 
On Wednesday, the CSSD the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success. 
The People's Party was satisfied. 
Mandela was in the new film by Clint Eastwood played by Morgan Freeman 
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: the Ungeschlagene" of the world, much of the country from its fight and victories despite some criticisms that the main role was filled by an American actor. 
The story tells of sport, race relations and on Nelson Mandela. 
The tireless campaigner against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-actor, Morgan Freeman. 
Freeman said that he was asked by the einundneunzigjährigen Mandela, whether he could be in the Eastwood film. 
A further important role Matt Damon. 
I said to him: "If I play, I must take you. 
The zweiundsiebzigjährige actors, the price for his role in the Eastwood-drama from the Boxbereich "million dollar baby" had received, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from the end of the slave owners, a fictional U.S. president, and God in "Evan Allmächtig ", but rarely someone who is still alive, and for many people is as important as Mandela. 
The former South African statesman was for his active activity at the end of apartheid in the South African Republic of 27 years in prison. 
He was released in 1990 undfür four years he was president of the country. 
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. 
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "ungeschlagen ", and at the same time, is the name of a Gedichtes of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875. 
The requirement was to speak, as he 
The film recounts a true story, in which Nelson Mandela his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people after apartheid still race remains divided and economically. 
He believes that he can agree people through sport, so he decides, the rugby players in the world, the outsiders. 
Finally, the South African team is in the World Cup of 1995. 
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela-history on the cinema screen. 
He had no other goal than to play this role, such as closely as possible to move closer to the reality, Freeman said. 
The biggest challenge was, of course, so to speak, as he. 
The actor said, if he and the world leaders would be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, to eat with him and in his speech to be behind the scenes. 
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela's hand. 
I have noticed when I give you the hand schüttele, I accept your energy, they will be transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said. 
For me, it is important to become a different person. 
Matt Damon is in the film François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed. 
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world. 
It was a big surprise for him, as he Pienaar met for the first time in his house. 
I remember, when I rang the door bell rang that he opened up and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life, was: "in the film, I see a lot more from ". 
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has headed by director East Wood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" positive reviews and we are also talking about prospects for an Oscar. 
The film critic of the newspaper Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summed up his assessment in the following words: "this was a very good story, very well ausgeführter film." 
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes. Com, Invictus 76 percent positive evaluations. 
Light secrets on Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile 
Norway was a special light effect of unknown origin. 
The Russian Defense Ministry has only yesterday admitted that near the Norwegian border an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested. 
The launch was again not successful and as a type "Bulava" missile, which was originally the pride of the Russian army should be, is becoming a nightmare of Russian Generalität and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. 
Even His repeated presence on the ground in the missile test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights. 
Bulava is usually not at all or damaged in the air. 
In Russian newspapers about "Bulava" than a "missile, which flies." 
A missile, which flies, but not 
This is already 13 attempt, was at the beginning of normal. 
Only at the end of the flight, in turn, technical damage to the rocket. 
Presumably the engine exploded in the third rocket stage. 
This time, "Bulava" from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went under the water of the White Sea. 
This Raketentyp allows the shooting down from the submarine. 
It is likely that caused by an unspecified fliegendes object mysterious light on North because actually damaged "Bulava." 
In addition, the Norwegians since the first moment not doubt that it is a Russian rocket. 
The Generalität has diesesmal challenged and claims that it cannot speak clearly from a failure. 
The first two stages of the rocket fell, and the accident was only the third stage. 
In the previous cases were damaged the engines in the first stage. 
Even if no test launch without error, the head of the Defense Department considers only six out of thirteen for unsuccessful. 
The nearly 50% success, the generals met with optimism and so that the "Bulava" will fly again without problems and even to ten hyper-noise-nuclear warheads with a total weight of Max. 1.15 tonnes will continue to claim.

Hyundai was the unions after all overtime will be lifted. 
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime. 
Because of frequent overtime, the union announced the strike on Monday. 
The spokesman confirmed the car factory Hyundai, Petr Vanek. 
The board wants but with the unionists still on a Saturday classes this week. 
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, 19 December, voluntary overtime for the reason that two working groups would be worked Vanek said.

Czech discovery: a substance that also tempered like steel 'HIV viruses works 
The team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds, to prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body. 
The main advantage of improved substance is that he is also in the viruses that are resistant to drugs. 
This fact against the disadvantage that the link to normal virus variants are not as strong as one of the existing medicines. 
The disease AIDS cannot be cured. 
The patients, the drug combination but can prolong the lives and prevent the reproduction of the HIV virus in the body. 
But their income will be accompanied by a whole series of side effects. 
Incomplete suppression of the virus reproduction also has the development sg. Resistentviren, against the medicines are more effective. 
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (chemically-Technological University) Prague, from the University of Heidelberg opens the way, how to deal with the virus-resistant. 
They have proven that as Metalokarborane substances on the protein substance, which is responsible for the expansion of HIV Viruses. 
The Metalokarborane are links of boron and hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. 
These compounds block the virus reproduction in other ways than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem. 
In their work, the scientists to new 'improved' links, have been prepared on the basis of knowledge of the Molekularmechanismus their attachment to the viral protein. 
The Metalokarborane have an unique three-dimensional structure: two vielfächige cages from Bor, hydrogen and carbon atoms and through a metal atom, in this case, cobalt, are linked. 
Heinous and constant virus 
HIV Protease is protein substance of the HIV virus, which for the life cycle of the virus is essential. 
Without the HIV caused by the HIV Protease division would not mature infectious virus particles. 
If we eliminate the HIV Protease, we call the propagation of the virus in the body of the patients, the scientists in the press report, by the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR. 
In the work in the Science newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry was published, the scientists describe whole rows of compounds, in which two couples the cages (see table) by a brief organic chain are linked, then systematically changed. 
A little weaker, but reliable 
The impact of this series of substances against the HIV Protease wurdne tested in place, even against their steady (resistant) variants, which were won by HIV-infected patients. 
The impact of the Metalokarborane in the usual enzyme-variant is not as strong as the clinically used medicines, but they do not lose their effect on the resistant variants, against the medicines are often ineffective. 
The unique effect mechanism and its other properties, such as the biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical ways, makes the Metalokarboranen to interesting links for further on the development of effective drugs against HIV research, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory for structural biology of the Institute for organic chemistry and biochemistry and the Institute for molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences. 
Dispute over budget. ODS went on fishermen, the Fights Back 
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "terrifying" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, in his view, consider their continued existence. 
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as a "strong worry." 
It is time for the analysis. 
The deputy ODS, Petr Necas, said that the concept of official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party apparently no longer works. 
After the Prime Minister Necas must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament, when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether it is to remain in office through the Parliament left. 
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats on the issue of public deficits is diametrically opposed to depart, Necas pointed out. 
The Parliament on Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, but with Link party-amendments on more than 12 billion kronor. 
Parliament has the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of the social services and for direct payments to farmers. 
The government has concealed the proposals of social democracy, that they increase the budget deficit. 
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion kronor. 
The ODS has left the chamber before the vote, it is the desire of the government, because the amended budget is only a less bad version of the budget provisional arrangements. Frase not clear 
Frustration and futility 
The Finance Minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken of his disappointment and a sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has stated that the government of the current situation. 
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously with his resignation in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would be different. 
According to the Czech Television has Janota on Monday after the government business in the Premier. 
He has indicated that he will remain in office. 
The reason is his disappointment on the Verhandugn of budgets. 
To what extent fishermen for the fight with the budget deficit, so that, in accordance with the Nominanten Necas the Social Democrats (CSSD), the changes in the budget, the government had nothing to do. 
The Premier should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament adopts continue to deficit-boosting laws, for example, sick pay and pensions or the service law should be changed. 
Topolanek: The ODS nominated ministers were wrong not 
This is a matter for the Prime Minister, fishermen and the entire government. 
The ODS nominated ministers have not made mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States. 
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function people who subscribe to top 09 who voted against the budget. 
Necas said that if fishermen in favour decides to the fight against the level of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority, which is now in Parliament ". 
He Then allegedly with the support and tolerance of the citizens of Democrats. 
I have not thought about it, and if it will be, then I will deal with it, of the citizens of Democrats nominated Defence Minister Martin Bartak said the journalists in Parliament. 
Premier Fischer flew in the afternoon at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels. 
The ODS came at the request of the Prime Minister. 
Necas said at the same time that the ODS probably on Wednesday in Parliament would vote against the revised budget, if the Premier Members of the citizens of Democrats explicitly ask that allow the adoption of the budget. 
We are not as orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic has been pushed back. 
I have not noticed that my vote would be lacking. 
As I withdrew to the mandate, I knew that in coming months, especially at Bolschewisierung of Parliament and destruction of everything would be positive, Topolanek itself.

It is the fifteenth route of suburban transport system Esko, whose opening thanks to the rail electrification from Lysa nad Labem after Milovice possible. 
The long-distance routes in the capital will be in the target station Prague - main railway station. 
The CD is more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains after Sumperk / Jesenik in the space of two hours. 
With the Pendolino passengers since 13 December can no longer go to Bratislava. 
This year's bill for regional rail: increase of 200 million

The railway praises the system, it has not resorted to the increase in the price of the vast majority of tickets. 
Among changes, it is only in one-day network ticketed CD Net and favourable Internetfahrscheinen eLiska. 
For passengers without the customer card will be the price CD Net of 450 kroner to 600 kroner. 
The price eLiska will depend on the frozen Stecke, until now, he was for travel between any Bezirkstädten uniform and cost 160 kroner. 
Philippine inches aunt take more than 50 people, the children have been released. 
Millitante kidnapped today in the south of the Philippines 75 people, including some primary school pupils and their teachers.

Jancura collects complaint for libel against three head of the CSSD. 
The owner of the student Agency, Radim Jancura, criminal proceedings for libel against three social-democratic leaders. 
Against Michal Hasek from the district of southern Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district Olomouc, Martin Tesarik. 
Jancura said this in a zwanzigminütigen Inteview on radio Journal. 
The complaint is linked to the efforts of the company, the regional trains in some districts. 
All regions have signed but ultimately the long-term contracts with the Czech railways. 
All three head are attacking us and say that we take the cherries, we have the offer only on the size, as it was voted with them. 
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech railways, because we know the prices of the Czech railways, were completed last week. 
So we are left with nothing else than to defend ourselves. 
Because of this defamation of society student Agency, said Jancura radio Journal. 
At the same time he gave was that he has evidence from all districts that they have made their steps in accordance with European law. 
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission. 
Hasek, the collection of the criminal proceedings for the continuation of the media show of Jancura him as free advertising for his company and for his own person.

Because of the criticism of the movement of trains in the districts threatened him, according to Jancura, already a member of the CSSD. 
The only threat was, if we do not do that we can lose the Buslizenzen. 
He was a Member of the CSSD, I know who they are, I am not saying his name, said today the radio Journal. 
Vaccination against Pneumokokken free of charge and voluntarily 
Imfung against Pneumokokken changes from January. 
It is a first for the families for free and voluntary. 
But now the floor votes that the compulsory vaccination would be more effective. 
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against Pneumokokken culminate. 
The medicinal institute already sets the maximum price of vaccines, which have to pay for health insurance. 
The experts are also on the vaccination procedure in the clear. 
New vaccination 
Free vaccines for August-children 
From January can be vaccinated against Pneumokokken children free of charge, on 2 August last year and later were born. 
The condition st that they have not received a vaccine dose. 
Anyone who has begun with the vaccination in the last year or earlier, must also pay weitereWiederholungsimpfung itself. 
The first dose of vaccine should be between 3 and 5th month of life of the child. 
Last year, a quarter of the families to vaccinate their children against Pneumokokken. 
The parents paid 1, 600 crowns and more for a dose. 
For the vaccination of the youngest children are four doses required. 
As a whole, the experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccination doses of 300, 000 to 450, 000 kroner per year. 
They save but in the treatment, the children without vaccination would need. 
Until now, the state for all land vaccination of children spent around 500, 000 per year. 
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package. 
Pneumokokken Mittelohrentzündung, but also cause serious infections including Gehirnhautentzündungen and blood poisoning. 
By Pneumokokkeninfektionen under investigation in hospitals per year for up to 28 children up to the age of 10 years. 
Outside of the Czech Republic was the duty-vaccination of children against Pneumokokken introduced in some 40 countries. 
Will the vaccine be mandatory? 
At the same time, said that this vaccine could be in the future. 
From January to this by insurance paid and voluntary. 
The compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the citizens association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky. 
His association already in the long term for the Pneumokokken vaccination. 
The experts at the international conference, which our group was involved, were not very satisfied that we have voluntary vaccination. 
This is not ideal. 
On the other hand, we are pleased that we succeeded, at least. 
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky. 
The Health Ministry wants but The vaccination procedure against Pneumokokken cannot change. 
In this moment, we are considering not At all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen. 
The voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say. 
The chairman of the society of practical Kinderärzten, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks. 
If all children were vaccinated, then it could be on the reduction of vaccination number "in a situation in which the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine launched a voluntary," says allerdingst Cabrnochova. 
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of The parents their infants against Pneumokokken from next year. 
Vaccination against Pneumokokken is groundbreaking, that this is the first to land Vaccination of the health insurance paid for and not by the state. 
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so that they save for further treatment, erkärt Cabrnochova. 
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves. 
This is a concern of the practical children doctors linked to the purchase of vaccines. 
After the initial project vaccines should be bought by the insurance companies and doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state. 
Some Members feared that the insurance so "the money from the health insurance could lead." 
Therefore, the doctors will buy the vaccines themselves and must wait until the insurance companies pay for them. 
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners to invest 40, 000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum. 
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.

Can the Islam French? 
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state. 
At a time when the Swiss voters have voted for a ban on building minarets and is widespread concern about the alleged Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote a thorough and thoughtful report on whether Muslims in one of the avowedly säkularisiertesten societies of Europe can be integrated and. 
Some readers will this new book from admiration for the work of the author: "Why the French no scarves love" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves ") (2006) read, an elegant and densely argumentierenden study a contentious issue, which divided the country about one and a half decades and employed and whose effects are still visible. 
Bowens neustes book offers a more comprehensive and kühneres spectrum. 
As a good anthropologist, he would like to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening on the field. 
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces." 
He is a good listener, He gives debates between teachers and students about the issues that concern them most. 
Should marry a Muslim in a mosque or a town Hall (or both)? 
Should be lectured young Muslims about evolution and rights of homosexuals? 
Can marry a Muslim woman a non-Muslim man? 
Is It permissible for a Muslim to use a zinsorientiertes banking system in order to get a mortgage? 
It is these seemingly mundane affairs, he claims, the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas, the media. 
The author acknowledges a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a familiar name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholars and academics. 
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the other hand, a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. 
They do not have all the arguments on their side. 
The Conservatives are wary of the idea of a French or European Islam. 
The thinkers and activists interviewed Bowen, are with their Salafi counterparts - supporters of the puristischen Sunni Islam with Saudi Arabia - a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims. 
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible. 
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides. 
It is, to what extent French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, so passionate guarded the separation of church and state) really committed to pluralism. 
He suggests that Muslims may be a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who had to make their historic compromise with the secular Republicanism. 
He sees a "tightening of the screws" as a growing pragmatism. 
Can the islam-as French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet." 
The bleak outlook of the world 
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other environmental region on Earth. 
The ice, which is melting at an alarming rate and takes life that can survive anywhere else. 
Oil, gas, Schifffahrts and fishing interests have in the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake. 
Richard Ellis, an author and Illustrator, paints in "on thin ice" (original title: "on thin ice "), a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bears. 
Bewandert in the complex history and politics of the whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arktiserforscher who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bears. 
Admiral Nelsons encounter with a polar bears as a brave 14 - year-old Fähnrich sea, only with his rifle butt Muskete fought, is certainly a myth, but others are true. 
Young bears, which, as they have been caught behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were killed in zoos and circuses. 
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a vision. 
Even today Zooanlagen still typically a millionth of the life of a wild Alttiers. The climate is rarely appropriate: the Eisbär in Singapore was quite green of the algae that grow in the hollow hair of his fur.

Ironically, in the waters in the north of this two hunting nations the ice longest remain. 
In his new book "after the ice" (original title "after the ice ") offers Alun Anderson, a former editor of science magazine new Scientist," a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a packenden insight as to how the future could develop.

Marines were among the 6, 000 in Arlington placed wreaths laid down 
The Obergefreite De "Angello Robinson went seven hours by bus to a single wreath at the grave of a soldier, he had never met. 
For him and the other marines, what the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they are entered. 
In a few months, from where we are returned, we could be, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers. 
If we were, I would hope that someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect. 
He was one of more than 6, 000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning, placed wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery. 
Morrill Worcester, holder of the funeral Company Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded in 1992 this tradition, as he and some others decided, several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington to dekorieren. 
It is now a 18 year old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip each year, in various cities along the road to organize events, the people in the military and are paid to victims of terrorism. 
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America (placed Wreaths Across America), the event has also extended to other states. 
This year, more than 16, 000 volunteers placed wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on the graves of National cemetery in Fayetteville Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the memory site for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
The Walmart Foundation has donated for the second time, more than 150, 000 dollars for purchase and transport of placed wreaths. 
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she has made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldiers. 
Although her husband is buried in Arlington, said Hunt, this is their way to give something back to the victims. 
She said that this is a small contribution, how we can support civilians our soldiers. 
It is like the visit of a family tomb. 
Wrapped in warmer clothes, the volunteers across the vast lawn land and hills of the cemetery. 
The volunteers were older graves from 1 and 2 World War and the Vietnam War as an objective, because they are not visited as often as the newer graves, the organisers. 
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples in the hand, while the fresh pine branches on the grey increasingly grave stones. 
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon, the upper section. 
The section 60, which is in the vicinity and where veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost calm. 
The United Service Organizations cheered 1, 000 placed wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars met this area. 
Some wept openly, others prayed and families and friends kept each other in the icy air. 
Some read aloud the names in stone, while others to small black-white place cards that had been set for those in the wet mud, whose tombstones were not yet completed. 
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who was crying before the grave of her son bitter tears. 
It is 8 hours of Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marineinfranterie-Corporal David Shane to visit in July in the fight.

The U.S. government contractors by Cuban authorities arrested 
The Cuban government has a contractor to the U.S. government, mobile phones and Notebook computers sold in the country, arrested, said representatives of the Foreign Ministry on Saturday. 
The contractor, which has not yet been identified, works for Development alternative, Inc., with headquarters in Bethesda. 
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. 
Konsularbeamte the interests of the United States in Havana to try to gain access to the prisoner, who was arrested on 5 December. 
The specific charges have not yet been published, although after Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitors for almost everything, on charges of "endangering" can be arrested. 
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest. 
Anti-government graffiti and statements are regarded as a serious crime. 
Cuba has a growing blogger community, which is led by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband persecuted and attacked by government representatives. 
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected. 
The arrest of an American contractors will probably increase the tension between the communist government of Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is a "slow" approach to improve relations with the island had sought. 
The news of the arrest was first Friday night by the New York Times reported. 
The new U.S. policy stresses that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition. 
Mobile phones and note Books in Cuba are legal, even though they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of government employees is 15 dollars a month. 
The Cuban government allows only since this year, ordinary citizens to the purchase of a mobile phone, they will be used for the sending of text messages, since a 15 - minütiges telephone conversation would cost a daily wage. 
The Internet use is restricted on the island. 
It is in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and some government agencies, such as universities, accessible. 
Cubans who want to connect, often the government must notify their names. 
Too many websites is restricted access. 
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare. 
Most of the few U.S. citizens in Cuba are in prison for crimes such as drug smuggling behind bars, Gloria Berbena said, the press spokesman for the representation in Havana. 
Berbena said she could give no further information on the arrest. 
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong. 
An activity that in any other free society legally - the levy free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the American section of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently a harsh report on freedom in Cuba, with the title "new Castro, Cuba ", an allusion to the investiture of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, the sick older brother Fidel replaced. 
Vivanco said that the defendants often within a day were arrested, convicted and imprisoned. 
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries move closer together for greater willingness to engage in dialogue. 
Pakistani government officials plan to meet to send men to Afghanistan. 
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday a supposedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at five men from northern Virginia to send to Afghanistan in order to kill U.S. soldiers, and said that they hope this case could help to uncover a vast network of terrorist recruitment agencies, the Internet after radicalised young men. 
Investigators said that a shadowy insurgents, known as Saifullah, had sought, the men had been invited to Pakistan after he had made, because one of them on the Internet video site YouTube favourable comments to terrorist attacks. 
Saifullah after their arrival in Pakistan of the leaders of these men and tried to help them to reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is the home of Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. 
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service, which was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah was not the al-Qaeda leader that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network. 
As a result, they were on days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far removed from the inhospitable mountains in the north-west, which have become a terrorist haven. 
They were seen as part of a covert operation. 
That is why they were rejected, said the government officials who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter. 
The government officials said that the men were not discouraged and continue to try to get the right recommendations in order to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps, when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement authorities. 
The case of five men, who are in Pakistan and will be interviewed by the FBI - underlines the vital role of recruiters in the identification of future terrorists and possibly even more important in deciding who is trustworthy. 
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U.S. secret service to a matter of the utmost urgency, human asset within Al Qaeda. 
The gangmasters act as guardians of the organisation, is not let those whose commitment to the holy war seriously enough and those that might be spies. 
American would-be recruits from a Qaeda of a special examination, said analysts. 
Because of their potential access to U.S. objectives and its propaganda value, but also as hugely attractive to the group. 
Evan Kohl man, the highest analyst of the NEFA Foundation, based in the United States, said that terrorist groups in recent years have become much more cautious about whom they allow access, because the U.S. intelligence experts in their recruitment methods. 
If you try to send anyone in these groups, what better way could go, as the recruitment model to follow, which so many have followed?, Kohlmann said. 
The model is based much more on the Internet. 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators are calling in Copenhagen climate "Action" 
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded by the negotiators in the conference centre of the city kühneres action on climate change. 
Demonstrators said that 100, 000 people had joined the event, while the police estimates of around 25, 000. 
The event passed off relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists small explosive devices in the vicinity of some government buildings in the city centre zündete. 
On a day when the promoted by the U.N. climate talks little happened, thousands of activists with banners through the city, which in English, "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared that "the Earth says" enough ". 
Some stars joined the protest, for example, the Danish model, the Fotografin Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, the native country of their birth mother, her aware, with the heart-breaking problems the country because of the already significant effects of climate change. 
This is part of the reasons why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - pass to the floor and to the world leaders to a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said. 
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around the. 
The police kept the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella Center and said that they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either mitführten or pocket knife. 
According to Danish law, these actions are banned during demonstrations. 
According to a viewer, who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators burned in black clothes several explosive devices in the vicinity of the Copenhagen main canal, near where several ministries. 
They threw them in the vicinity of the buildings, he said and added that it began as a Leuchtraketen, but then followed by "a few large explosions ". 
On the inside of the Congress Centre people on television screens to watch the whole afternoon the demonstration. 
But the protest has the awareness of the main officials, such as Su as China's chief climate negotiator, apparently not. 
When he was asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a positive impact on the international considerations, he replied in English: "this is something that I was not even aware of." 
He then drove in Mandarin and said: "Because of the venue is great, I cannot hear what is happening out there." 
He said that from the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would help or harm. 
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said. 
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or the freedom of other people ". 
Test data show persistent racial divide 
The certificates to mathematics performance last week was welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D. C. 
Although the District Washington still far behind the schools in the country, the maximum benefits, show the evidence that the Viert- Achtklässler in the last two years, faster progress than cities, Atlanta, Chicago and New York, have made. 
But in the latest figures from the National Assessment of educational Progress (National Assessment of educational Progress (NAEP) is included, is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white pupils, both at local and National level. 
The average score of white Viertklässler from Washington D. C. rose in the last two years by 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which has increased its African-American peers but only three points from 209 to 212. 
In reality, The performance gap rose between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points. 
The progress of the African-American Achtklässler remained essentially the same, he fell a statistically negligible point of 245 to 244. 
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data, because the sample size was not big enough. 
The picture over a six-year period is not encouraging. 
The gap, the white and black Viertklässler separated in 2003, when the first NAEP was covered in this district, 60 Skalenpunkte (262 to 202). 
And although the item number, the children of both groups have grown in that time span, the difference with 58 points. 
Some education advocates of the District last week expressed its concern that the results of schools Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty celebrated, for the most part of white pupils who are already strong children. 
This suggests that we have increased the overall assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is complicated and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a member of the board of D. C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for the educational equality in Washington D. C. 
I springe not for a span of two or three points, and, said the democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of Eaton-primary school. 
Brown, a frequent critic of the management style of Rhee, said the message of the message is that the secondary schools the city need urgent attention. 
Of course, you would always see the positive signs, I respect. 
What frightens me, however, is that we are not nearly the time and energy that we need to use for our middle school. 
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the current weak pupils. 
In This autumn, for example, some teachers trained a new reading curriculum, the Wilson-reading system, aimed at pupils in the upper classes of elementary school and middle school, the basic skills of reading have not at the beginning of their school career and the significantly behind their peer classmates. 
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum, from kindergarten to sixth-class games and real life experience to the fore, was among the former chief schools inspector Clifford Janey brought to Washington and this curriculum, some of the NAEP-progress last week, which were attributed to that. 
I believe that we must continue to work to the best measures the pupils to benefit under the central level, Rhee said. 
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system and will continue to improve the additional money and resources for the current weak schools, which are necessary in order to reduce the gap. 
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, the urban audit results. 
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms at the schools, which are in the poorest areas of Washington D. C. 
The objective could create political fallout working against this important agenda item. 
The weak point is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors that they are trying to keep the white and black middle class. 
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools. 
We need to strengthen our schools in districts, so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education. 
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements of closing the achievement gap is the traditional public school year, which is currently in Washington, to extend 180 days, in order to compete with charter schools. 
We must increase the school year to nearly 200 days, in order to have the power to change, said Janey who, with his teachers' union last year to reach an agreement on 185 days per year, which he called "a milestone" on the road to a greater increase in the next treaty. 
Higher education for more people than a future 
The coach reached the Gettysburg-College with a loud pipes. 
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, and blinzelt a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and smaragdgrünen lawn. 
Gracielas parents have completed the High School in El Salvador. 
Until recently, had also Graciela in silver Spring was recovered and now lives in Riverdale, never set foot on a college campus. 
Their attitude and the other Achtklässler the group, explore the Gettysburg, where the teaching 38.690 dollars per year, a respectful visitor, rather than an enthusiastic future students. 
"Yes, I will soon be here!" Cried Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the leaders announced that they had entered the building for natural sciences. 
"Wow, really?" said they thought, as the low teacher-to-student ratio of the school. 
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th, the children to their three-day tour visited and now they have the intended message completely: the question is not whether it's college. 
The question is where. 
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States hispanischer immigrants, what the High School or as a pregnant teenager, on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands of what the college, which is in the middle class. 
In truth, one of five of these "second generation" of Hispanoamerikaner the college - which is a remarkable achievement, given that many of their immigrierten parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, In the United States, without the High School. 
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because it for a generation, which will play a huge role in the labor force in the country, show the way forward. 
Those who study powerful children, say, they often have a natural affinity for the school and its inherent momentum to success. 
Many of them have parents who give their children high goals and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools. 
But advisory programmes also play a major role by Graciela and millions of children as they help to college, especially if these efforts over a longer period of time. 
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them in the Wegsuche through the system, it will be a single measure at any time does not solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California at Davis, who hispanoamerikanische students. 
We have to think about it, for these children a supporting network of pre-school up through the High School. 
The federal program that Gracielas college tour, is an useful example. 
It is known as GEAR up - an and is more than $300 million dollars a year for local school systems available to college preparation programme to the start, if low-income students in the middle school and continue until they have completed the high school. 
According to the U.S. Department of Education has helped the programme since 1999, more than 10 million pupils, of which more than 60% in college. 
Iraqi oil ministry includes contracts with foreign oil companies from 10 
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government on Saturday completed auctions in two major oil companies can get to rebuild its damaged infrastructure. 
The 10 contracts with foreign oil companies of the Iraqi Ölministeriums suggests that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which for decades by war and economic sanctions. 
American companies have only shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields for themselves. 
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday. 
The only company that has made a bid, has drawn The short straw. 
Two American companies have been able to conclude contracts for versteigerte fields in June. 
The sparsely gesäten representatives of American oil multinationals in the opening up of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts. 
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies give Asian and European path, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service. 
There will be no further bids in Iraq. 
Security concerns were highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the withdrawal of the U.S. military, American oil companies have probably prevented, analysts said to be more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. 
US companies were in some cases, because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy company, have significantly lower labor costs and more risks, because they are not accountable to shareholders. 
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies have been able to conclude contracts with the ministry. 
Major U. S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which with the Iraqi oil ministry close relations and in recent years, with technical advice, are empty. 
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. 
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and with large packages of contracts for two major fields go home. 
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ölministeriums, Assam Jihad that China is on the way, one of the big players in the world economy, as a technology power. 
We are convinced that the Chinese company with its Mitbietern and will meet its commitments to Iraq. 
For the commandment levy vorausgewählte companies gave commandments, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, the ministry was willing to pay the emission of each Felds to increase beyond the current level. 
Top planners of Al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan 
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan this week, a top Al Qaeda, have been killed, representatives of the U.S. Terrorismusbekämpfung reported on Friday. 
This would be, if it would confirm the second deadly attack on a senior leaders of the terrorist organisation in this autumn. 
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities representatives of the region by a number of missiles, which have been killed on Tuesday her car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan. 
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a Drohnentyp, which is used by the CIA in the lawless tribal belt of Pakistan. 
They drove in a white car in the direction of the Afghan border, as the car was taken, said a representative of a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah by telephone. 
Locals who are suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the site and quickly took everything, which completely destroyed by the "bodies ". 
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US-led fight against terrorism led an unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead. 
Somali has been described as a leading military planners of Al Qaeda, the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan. 
He was involved in plots around the world, said a senior official, who wished to remain anonymous, and the sensitive nature of the U.S. air attacks on Pakistani soil. 
If his central role as a given, it also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe. 
He took strategic instructions from the Topführern of Al Qaeda and turned them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks. 
The second American authorities representative said that Somali quickly in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and best compounds used to other extremist groups in the region. 
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second, but this reduces the risk that He was for us and our allies. 
If confirmed, his death would be the second leading Somali Al Qaeda or Taliban leader who was killed since September, in a similar attack Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant group in the tribal area and three other Topaktivisten were killed. 
The pace of attacks by unmanned air vehicles of the CIA since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a nonprofit organization maintained website, by an average of six operations per month to two. 
The decline can be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups, have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and, at the same time, the suspected informers brutal killing, reported the side. 
Senior U.N. envoy in Kabul will resign 
The senior U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, which would end a stormy tenure, the allegations of widespread corruption in the Afghan presidential election has been tarnished. 
Oath redundancy, as the Obama administration has decided to send 30, 000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. 
The U.N. envoy said that he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns about the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw its forces. 
We need to accelerate the development of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. 
This commitment must be long term. 
The Norwegian diplomat urged the United States and other military powers, to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in the political transition. 
The troop increase on the military side must meet an increase on the civilian side, he said. 
Eide said that he does not resign his office, but only one in March 2008 complies with his family agreement, only two years to remain in Kabul. 
He said that he wanted the notification of UN 
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now pass, so that he had time to look for a replacement. 
What I have said is that it is better to seek a successor, Eide said. 
When I came here, there was a zweimonatiges vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival. 
Ban has, according to U.N. representatives with the search for a replacement. 
The U.N. officials say that the Swedish Italian stämmigen Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the U.N. mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, the U.N. peacekeeping operations, has taken into account. 
Oath position in Afghanistan has been put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, had accused him in September, President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and to cover up evidence of massive electoral fraud. 
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the allegations of Galbraith, who was fired, "the mission have undoubtedly damaged, because a great deal of scepticism in to the international interference in the election ". 
Eide said that he has recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the aid of the American-led forces in Afghanistan. 
He also urged that the U.N. leadership allows his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, and said that it would strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly. 
Eide expressed his disappointment about the restriction of its forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome U.N. recruitment rules have undermined its ability to introduce capable people. 
The U.N. rules are designed so that I since May, he said, only one person was able to stop. 
This is disastrous and must not continue. 
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must reckon with additional sanctions 
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be "significant additional sanctions" on Iran, because he was not in talks on its nuclear plans. 
Gates spoke during a 7 - day tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of around 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
In Iran, there are no good options, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such a development. 
"One of the things I on the soul, is, if we in the last six years have learned something from Iraq, the war own Unvorhersagbarkeit." 
The Obama administration prefers a sanctions package, aimed at the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranians. 
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "in order to convince the Iranian government that it is protected with nuclear weapons, in reality, less" because "their people tremendously" suffering under the sanctions. 
On Friday, in a statement from the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, the American government, the European leaders in the warning that Iran must reckon with "credible" consequences if it with its nuclear programme to the demands of the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
Iran maintains that the knowledge of nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes to be won. 
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said that he would resume the talks to curb its nuclear programme and a substantial part of its stores stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor. 
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and time for negotiations to win. 
Iran, but since that time the negotiations on the interim agreement to leave, in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether they should commit themselves to the United States. 
That Iran the international community with regard to some of the proposals, which it had already agreed in early October, has simply left has, frankly, the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, brought together in a way, as they did in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran were never, Gates said. 
President Obama has set the 31 Dez. as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "crippling sanctions ". 
In a statement issued in New York has condemned the Iranian representative at the United Nations, which it on Thursday "gratuitous and unfundierte allegations" of some Security Council members called on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, "in order to achieve an appropriate long-term solution ". 
Gates, who last Friday should return to Washington, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning, before flying in the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil. 
The tension between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular in relation to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues. 
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict, in order to prevent delays of U.S. plans to reduce the American troop strength by the end of August by 115 000 to 50, 000. 
Gates also sought, the Kurdish concern about the imminent withdrawal of troops. U.S. Representative quoted Gates, Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will your security, your well-being and your autonomy within an united Iraq. 
We will not leave you. " 
A change of direction in the ageing China 
Wang Weijia and her husband, surrounded by propaganda posters on them lectures that "mother earth is too tired to talk to other children" and "a baby more means a grave." 
These lessons have you learned that, as well as government officials in Shanghai by the low birth rate and ageing population in this summer, suddenly began to change course and young couples ermunterten, more than to have a child, her response was immediate and definitive: "under no circumstances ". 
We already have all of our time and energy invested in a child. 
For a second child is nothing left, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with a 8 - month old son. 
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the two generations of notoriously dicklichen, spoiled individual children, who affectionately called "little emperors ", has produced a population crisis in the country. 
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 at the time, as this policy came into force, the UN 
Department of population issues, while the number of the population of 60 years and older in 2020 from 16.7 percent of the population by the year 2050 to 31.1 percent rise exponentially. This is well above the global average of around 20 percent. 
The imbalance is in rich coastal cities with educated population, such as Shanghai, stronger. 
Last year, 60 years and elderly almost 22 percent of reported residents of Shanghai, while the birth rate of one child per couple. 
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city population and family planning practice has said that couples get normal reproductive age babies, in order to help "to help the relationship of the ageing population and to alleviate the shortage in the future ". 
Shanghai will soon "as old - but not so rich - such as the industrialised countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said. 
A gradual easing 
In the constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy would be the most controversial disposal, which was introduced by the ruling Communist Party until today. 
Couples who are against this policy, must reckon with huge fines - up on her triple annual salary in some regions - and with discrimination in the workplace. 
Chinese officials have attributed to this policy, that the critical demands on natural resources could be avoided, while human rights activists have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy. 
In rural areas, some officials pregnant women who already had a child, forced to abzutreiben. 
Many couples have had to carry out sex-selective abortions, which an unnatural high ratio of men to women. 
In recent years, government representatives for population gradually their stance on the one-child policy weakened. 
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions to the rule - including urban dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been Einzelkinder - and 2007 was moderated the tone of many hard slogans. 
Qiao Xiao Chun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing said that government officials recently even more radical changes, for example, to allow two children, couples in which one partner is Einzelkind. 
Shanghai in July for the first Chinese city, which has launched an aggressive campaign to promote more births. 
Posters, the families belehrten, only to have a child, have been replaced almost overnight of directives, which describe in detail, who qualify for a second child and how to apply for approval. 
The city administration has sent municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to couples at home and information sheets under the doors. 
They also asked, psychological and financial advice for the available, which have more than one child. 
The response was not encouraging, said family planning officials. 
Disappointing response 
Although officials from a rural town in the external areas of Shanghai, said that a recovery in the requests from couples to recognize is that after the launch of the campaign for a second child, the urban districts reported against any change. 
In the Huinan municipality with a population of 115, for example, still only four or five requests per month. 
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that the 2010 expected number of births in the city despite the campaign still around 165.000 - slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008. 
Feng Juying, head of family planning committee of the Shanghai municipal Caolu, said that financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. 
They want to give her first best, she said. 
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juan Juan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and it is also legally allowed. 
But they have, how many Chinese, only a minor health and life insurance from the government. 
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible. 
People in the West to assess the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer, whose wife seven months pregnant with her first child. 
Yes, it is robbing us the opportunity to have more than one child. 
The problem is not simply a policy. 
The problem is money. 
Other couples be psychological reasons for their reluctance. 
Wang, the personnel chief, said that they would like to have a child because she was also an Einzelkind. "We were the focus of the family and used that cared about us. 
We are not accustomed to care for others and do not want to do this. " 
Chen Zijian, a 42 jähriger, a translation company, said it plain. 
For parents from the middle class with dual career, through which the birth rate is falling, he said, is about to be successful and we must be selfish. 
The age group of 20 to 39 - year-old grew so that their parents during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment to see and they want a life not for themselves, he said. 
Even a single child, he said, is huge demands on the time of the parents. 
A mother must abandon their social life for at least two years. 
Then there is the question - "we must rebuild his home" - and the life planning - "If the child is 9 months old, we have a CV for the best nursery schools." 
Most of his friends are ready, this time, said Chen, but not twice. 
Our generation is the first, which has achieved a higher standard of living, he said. 
We do not want too many victims. 
UN group plan to reduce emissions 
The by the U.N. climate conference - which until now by wild postures and mutual accusations - has set on Friday with the publication of a document, a priority for the next 40 years recording an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases, with the industrialised nations in the near future would have to shoulder the biggest burden. 
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has both the remaining obstacles, as well as the way forward. 
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation, the time next week, more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen. 
The text, which was created by a special U.N. working group, is silent on the amount of money from the rich countries to poor countries should be, so that these short- and long-term global warming can meet. 
He also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industry and major emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global rise in temperature, the political decision-makers. 
The process will be given a great deal of flexibility, John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington. 
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the six-page document, has drafted a 180 pages long negotiating text, with the focus on what the leading representatives of the U.N. climate change, Yvo de Boer, has described as "the big picture ". 
It shows the outline of a possible agreement, in which the industrial nations together their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared with the levels of 1990, would cut, while major developing countries were to reduce their emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 percent. 
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 2050 by 50 to 95 percent. 
The European Community has the talks on Friday also given a boost by their assurance, over the next three years, 3.6 billion dollars per year, in order to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from the masters of floods and droughts and avoiding deforestation. 
The Friday nonetheless expressed the same verbal fireworks, what the talks in the last week. 
The U. S. climate envoy Todd Stern has rejected wordings binding cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for major emerging economies, demand, if they are not funded by the industrialized nations. 
This train has announced that the Obama administration a tougher line with China, as a representative of the Bush administration, not even two years ago. 
The United States will sign an agreement without major emerging countries stand up and take action, so Stern, who also lamented the fact that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts also confirmed by outsiders. 
Stern gave its opinion a hour after the declaration of the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister he Yafei, stating that the leading U.S. climate negotiator either of "common sense" or "highly irresponsible" of him was that he said earlier this week that the United States, China would help to tackle global warming. 
The fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, both within the industrial nations, as well as between the industrialized nations and emerging countries fault lines. 
The current fight applies equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to save the planet, with China and the United States because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries argue that the two dozen influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder steps. 
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are, who bear the costs of the Bremsung of greenhouse gas emissions, because even affected countries have begun to act more aggressively, the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their they. 
It is clear that This is a game, which will develop a new economic domination, Ulate, who is also a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America. 
Some of the countries that the effects of climate change are most exposed to, said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants say that the talks in the best case will lead to a political agreement. 
The alliance of small island states with 43 members on early Friday morning, a 24 - page draft treaty. 
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states' political pressure on the entire political process, "in part because they are now united and measures of the emerging countries, such as China and India. 
The talks got a new urgency, as the delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues before the arrival of the government leaders need to be resolved to reach an agreement. 
Senior representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister entstiegen their aircraft and rasten through the corridors of Bella centres meetings behind closed doors and press conferences, claims to be negotiated during the next week. 
The sheer scale of the Assembly - 13, 000 people, daily in Congress Centre and, gitarrespielende activists hold late-night shows, in which they are fun of the countries who betrayed and sell, and draft Treaty passed from hand to hand rather than by e-mail - is already a challenge. 
The intensity builds just: Almost all important ministers are now here and on Wednesday, 60 government leaders in Copenhagen. 
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy of the organization Conservation International. 
The heavyweights. 
Britain's first 225 km/h speed train defined the Monday feeling new 
Monday morning at 5 pm 13 will penetrate a pipe penetrate the darkness, to announce a, a revolution in transport in Britain. 
The first high-speed commuter train in the country in his lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent to London St Pancras 225 km/h and 93 km in 38 minutes. 
To Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will then lady Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin-commuter services from London. 
He hopes that the new service to Britain finally to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and the major urban areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland will connect to London. 
The neglected province could become viable commuter towns, Arbeitsanfahrtszeiten would radically reduced and the exchange of plane and car to train the national carbon emissions and reduce congestion on the roads. 
In theory, believe the three main parties in this vision. 
But the many billion British pounds, which for the construction of a new national network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage in the British high-speed tracks still the brakes. 
High speed Two (HS2), a company based in January, the government should submit a feasibility study, Lord Adonis, according to the Times report on 30 December. 
This gives a detailed route map of the next stage of the high-speed rail network. 
The new rail line, linking London with the West Midlands, will pass with a margin of five metres in urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment are controversial. 
The free site will be the plan the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final stretch. 
HS2 will also have three options for a larger, northwards leading high-speed rail network. 
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. 
The preferred option proposed is a Y-shaped route, in which a single high-speed link in the West Midlands. 
The route would share in or near Birmingham and an Abzweig would west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another in the direction of North East after Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. 
A single line would lead to Scotland. 
"It seems to be the most viable option," said a railways insider. 
After the completion of the journey time between London and Edinburgh in 2 hours 40 minutes. 
The first part of the route would not be opened before 2025, would allow the travellers, the London-Birmingham stretch in 49 minutes, compared with just over a hour to go. 
The draft would offer the opportunity to travel with a speed of 400 km / h, increasing the British rail network would be the quickest of Europe. 
The first route was planned that 400 metres long trains with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people can drive. 
Up to 18 trains per hour could be on the London Birmingham in operation. 
This in turn would mean that a terminus in London would be needed on the 20, 000 passengers per hour could be processed. 
Given the space limitations in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be extended to accommodate the high-speed network. 
Rail experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential. 
Lord Adonis will announce whether this plan, in his opinion, should be continued or not, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision until after the parliamentary elections will be taken. 
But even if he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network to be built in sections. 
The trains would have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, thereby changing the travel time between London and Scotland in about three hours. 
This is a key sticking point, so that a switch from air to rail can be ensured a beacon for the rail revolution. 
Taxpayers for mortgages for 75, 000 pounds-orangerie a conservative on 
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative member of the house of Commons, has asked the taxpayer thousands of pounds per year for the cost of an Orangerie in building in his house in his constituency. 
The prison spokesman for the party, which was downgraded by David Cameron, because he complained that the House of Commons members' meager rations "must live, has increased its mortgage at 75, 000 pounds to a wooden-workshops to his second home in Rutland. 
He was allowed to the taxpayer to pay the additional interest, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month. 
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were also by Sir Thomas Legg, carrying out a review of the expenditure of the House of Commons members. Last night said Duncan that the "not even cleaner or more comprehensible." 
Duncan, one of the richest members, has a zweistöckiges house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton. 
In the nearby houses have a purchase price of nearly one million pounds (1.1 million euros). 
The ground floor includes kitchen, residential and Esszimmer, but the fees Office, a spending control centre of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needed more space. 
Last year, he has grown a winter garden, in the plans as "Orangerie." 
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment." 
Duncan was also during a recent examination of his previous mortgage contracts by the committee on standards and privileges not called for increased money. 
The committee has acquitted him last month after an investigation into his expenses by the breach of the rules. 
In 2004, Duncan security for a mortgage on 271.406 pounds (300, 000 euros) from his London house on his constituency house, which he transferred in 1991, a year before his election as Member of Parliament, had bought. 
This week published documents show that Duncan until March last year around 1, 400 pounds (1, 500 euros) per month as mortgage interest refund. 
In April, its claims to more than 1 800 pounds (2, 000 euros) per month. 
The rate of Duncans RBS-mortgage has not changed during this time, which suggests that the entire increase to finance the money of 75, 000 pounds (85, 000 euros). 
The normal stufenlos RBS mortgage interest rate fell from 7.94% in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where he is still standing. 
The latest of the House of Commons published documents show that Duncan in this May continue to be entitled to 1.250 pounds (1, 400 euros) per month. 
Duncan lost his job in September as the opposition leader of the House of Commons, after an Undercover reporter filmed him, as he said after the expenses scandal that members of parliament "of meagre rations" would live. 
"Basically, it means that if you are working for the state that you live on meager rations and must be treated as S * e." 
He said: "I have spent my money for my garden and will be entitled to a tiny part. 
And I would ask for the whole damn sum, but I do not do it. "

The surgeons of Los Angeles said that they were totally shocked, said Mr Camus. 
I have heard that there may be a trial, he said. 
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "much too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeons travelled to Los Angeles." 
I have with this doctor personally, who assured me that he considers this trip as entirely unproblematic, I am very surprised, because I already had two Bandscheibenoperationen behind me, he added. 
Shortly before he went in RTL announced that the singer apparently after the operation "without Drainage, without anything" to leave the hospital. 
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known. 
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, in which he practiced at this time. 
In 2007, he had the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg, to resorbieren a Hämatom after a brain blutung. 
He is also a doctor with dubious reputation, which has several times because of mishandled operations and not to forget about Steuerhinterzug and fraud, was sentenced. 
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer of the Medical, has described him as "a man without scruples ", the" regular "before the chamber board and" anything but commendable. " 
After a few days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux on Friday on his lawyer, Me, David Koubbi, a statement. 
He said that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations were "normal ". 
The operation "no bleeding and therefore requires no Drainage," he added. 
In any case, it seems that the tour of Sängers, whose health problems since letzem summer äufen, called into question. 
It is quite clear that it is a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens) a little too tight, Mr Camus said. 
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) will vigorously and calls for the party Nouveau Centre, not to use their Siegel 
The alliance is monitored by François Bayrou's party modem, on Friday to a takeover attempt by the label, once by Valéry Giscard d "Estaing party, the chairman of the party Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, reacted sharply and under threat of prosecution any document. 
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the UDF Siegel, because he is of the opinion that François Bayrou would not be worthy of this political legacy to defend after he had left the hand. 
The defence minister, whose party partner the UMP is, incidentally, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC. 
On the strength of his efforts, he had the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now in NC), which received a claim On the property of the trademark UDF, because he was the first this brand of 2004 in the "Institute National de la propriété industrial" has requested. 
However, the office of François Bayrou's friends supervised parties oversaw the silence and clearly gave us to understand that they are not expropriate and set the minister and the Member under threat of prosecution a deadline, not to use this more and to transfer the property rights of the brand. 
They have made in the last few days many statements that you would suggest your political movement, the UDF Siegelzu + +, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the party modem and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance. 
It is thought that you have the right to the name of this movement + Nouveau centre, the slogans + today's UDF +, on their political material, as well as the starting side of your website. 
As you know, you have no right to the use of this mark, said the secretariat of the UDF and calls for the party, "immediately the mention of the name UDF of sämtlichem material and (their) website." 
They demanded by Mr Hervé de Charette, "the property rights of the trademark of their legal entitlement to transfer." 
If you refuse, we will take action against you, in order to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned. 
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" since 1978 a fully-fledged political movement and remind you that Morin and his friends "have made the choice to leave this 2007 to start a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, the party ". 
The party has therefore Nouveau centre, the undersigned, no rights to use the UDF Siegel (Union pour la démocratie française). 
They continue to remind you that the last Congress of the UDF 2007 the three-year membership of the party modem and the establishment of a secretariat to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, has passed. 
What Mr Hervé de Charette, the secretariat is continuing, "he was at the time, he has requested the brand name, for three years, no longer a member of the UDF," but the UMP. 
He benefited on scandalous and fraudulent manner by the absence of deposit of Akronyms UDF to carry out this for themselves. 
You have to bear in mind that this recklessness on the best ways to turn into a criminal offence, and ironisieren the strategy of the NC: "it seems to us, but in politics as in life, to make a name for themselves, instead of trying to come out of anonymity, by, of a name that it has no legal rights." 
Affair Liliane beds Court: François-Marie Banier is convicted for exploitation of weakness 
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to assess the artist François Jean-Marie Banier, to determine whether he, as the daughter of Milliardärin Liliane beds Court, a weak moment of 80 - year-old has exploited in order to get a portion of their assets. 
The 62 - year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will be on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploitation of weakness in court, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of EUR 375.000. 
This decision means that it will be a process in this case, the saga of one of the richest families in France, is the mother and daughter scrap and at the same time the reins of the cosmetics empire in the hand. 
Equally, however, the 15th Criminal Court ordered a medical examination of the 87 - year-old Liliane beds Court, which is carried out jointly by three doctors. 
The heir and Hauptaktionärin of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially among the, during the investigation of the state prosecutor in Nanterre's conditions. 
On Friday appointed doctors before 10 March 2010 to present a report in which you clearly indicate whether and at what times Liliane beds Court may have been in a state of weakness. 
I think they will undergo these investigations. 
I will talk with her, said the lawyer of Mrs beds Court, Me Georges Kiejman, after the hearing. 
The lawyer by Françoise beds Court-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court. 
This is excellent news (...). The report will show that he (Banier) this old lady has manipulated, which must be protected, he said. 
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane beds Court a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, photographer and Allroundkünstler, and accused him, the weakness of their mother for years to have exploited to grants totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings. 
For its part, Liliane beds Court has always been refuted by the photographers, which it as a longtime friend. 
Although the court the admissibility of Mrs beds Court-Meyers would have to check, the Plaidoyers of lawyers on Friday led to a large family debacle. 
The lawyer of Liliane beds court on three of his Klientin at their notary sent letters (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that the husband of Françoise beds Court-Meyers. 
According to her lawyer Liliane beds Court the following: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I fifteen years, twice a day to Banier wrote. 
Françoise, I have since their marriage never more ". 
The public prosecutor of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected their request, a judicial protection proceedings against her mother. 
Liliane beds Court "is fully capable of law, is not under protection and has no guardian. 
No one has the right to act on their behalf, "reaffirmed the representative of the prosecutor, Marie-Christine Daubigney. 
The court has now determined to deliver a verdict after the trial on the admissibility of Mme beds Court-Meyers has taken place. 
Manager-revolution or the end of the Strategic early education? 
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence in vain... 
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to his staff, said the position of companies VIS à VIS consumers from the marketing revolution: it is for staff to join "values" determines the best, as it was earlier on the consumer-products of the technicians in the station. 
By the customer at the heart of the company has the marketing revolution the strategies of the conquest of the markets in place... Although separated the authoritarian temptation products separately factors preferences of customers to impose regularly again! 
A demobilisation of staff can lead to a deadly demoralisation. 
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon, in particular the employees affected. 
These demobilisation has a negative impact on the development of all intellectual functions of the company, in particular those of R Eund, what is even more importantly, to those of economic intelligence. 
In fact urges the IU (intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "by all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision "; hijacked by the staff, which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradictory. 
That is why we are calling for an occupational revolution, which would be the staff in denMittelpunkt the concerns of the company on an equal footing with the customers. 
The very-related benefits of internal polls 
The internal polls, as the questionnaire, the Orange has submitted his wage recipients, this revolution in relation to the management practice? 
I fear that, unfortunately. 
- First, because I could see that the entire structure with a new situation after many detours, to do... What it has always done. 
Also because the authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power in proportion to the importance of his own failures. 
And finally, because most leaders-indeed a vastly simplified notion of human behavior. 
Emerged from the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic. 
They play by intellectual comfort the old behavioristische theory, which recently by the U.S. "neuroscience" reactivated and unknowingly far-reaching of research institutes and through the media. 
Thus, and it suggests that it is possible, the "leverage" (sic) on the involvement of employees, an aktuellein Le Figaro. Fr poll by Ipsos executives in a position to a mechanistic control system, which is unsuitable for today's world. 
The mobilisation factors identify and measure 
Instead, a for the smooth functioning of the modern companies necessary occupational revolution the adoption of a final view of human behavior. 
It is, in any consideration or practice of management to integrate a fundamental minutes: for the wage-earners is the commitment to the company will only be possible if it clearly appears as a means to achieve a portion of their dreams, their ambition and their projects. 
Now take only the studies from the multifunctional analysis this conception of the motivation of staff. 
These studies have shown that their companies on the basis of a set, Doxa judge them by their perceived image of the company, to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals. 
Thanks to the identification and the measurement of this mobilisation factors can predict the executives of the social services ", and anticipate and its human resource management back to the right place. 
So they create a fertile ground for the coordinated development of a robust and effective economic intelligence. 
The speech by Oslo: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right a 
The American rights on Friday by Barack Obama on the eve of in Oslo welcomes and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States has defended. 
The Conservatives, the awarding of the prize to Obama had mocked on 9 October, applauded the speech by the President, the example of the former vice-presidential candidate in the elections of 2008 following Sarah Palin. 
I liked what he said, Palin said, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today and added that they themselves the subject of a "sometimes necessary" war in ihrensoeben published memoirs. 
The war is, of course, the last of which I think that Americans want to do it, but it is necessary. 
We must stop the terrorists down there, she says. 
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has worked on Thursday in Oslo, to justify the use of force; a way to explain his Entscheidungvon nine days ago to send 30, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan. 
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, took the view that the Präsdent in Oslo "very good work ". 
I found that the speech was really very good frohlockte the former president of the House of Representatives, particularly the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama's acknowledged. 
In some parts of habeich this speech quite as historic, Ginrich said in the radio programme "the take away" has been questioned. 
The Member, which some see as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the presidential election in 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left," the members of the Nobel Committee noted that they were "not free and a price for peace, if the use of force would not exist." 
For Michael Gerson, a former scribe of George W. Bush and now editor in the Washington Post, Obama has "a very American speech ". 
In addition, that he is "Kosmopolit ", as he always does," he had "as an American president, ", as he pointed out that the Europeans," as in a security bubble, which they do not themselves have created and for their protection they do not, "Gerson. 
Among the few, not convinced rights called the former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk in the Bush era, the speech on the website of the National Review Online as "boring, pompous and inspirationslos." 
On the left of the president of the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich worried about how Barack Obama defended the recourse to the armed forces. 
Wrapped the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocents, quite simply, he warns. 
The press of the moderate left, however, remains on the side of the president. 
The Los Angeles Times, which is still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama, described the speech itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as "Monumental ". 
The speech in Oslo "offers a plan for the management of international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper. 
The New York Times believes that Obama "the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "bleak and exemplary at the same time. 
Drivers: Three marathon for an agreement that ensures the supply of Christmas

After a second night of negotiations parted the negotiating on early Friday morning in the hope that the agreement late in the morning to sign quickly. 
And although the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting. 
However, it has taken more than six hours from the start of the meeting at 11:00 am until the conclusion of the agreement and at 18:00 pm the agreement was signed. 
The conflict, "the company would have very much harm" and "it was a fear that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau. 
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport). 
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages rising from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros. 
"It is not very much, but once we start small," Patrice Clos (FO). 
The activists are now instructed not to block The supply centers. 
"it will probably always be some recalcitrant who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added. 
The TLF-chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement ", although it was difficult to give these wage increases in The face of international competition ". 
According to him, the increase in 170 euros a month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wages. 
"This agreement is based on the common sense and respect for the employees," maxim Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) of "a historic agreement ". 
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said, "an acceptable compromise." 
The agreement also provides for the increase in the cost of travel by 3% and the upholding of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow it, in particular, the issue of 13 monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements. 
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of the levies on employers to the tune of 100 million," the subject of an amendment to the government the corrected finances for 2009, which was adopted in the night from Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly. 
The government calls "an identical" vote by the Senate. 
The signature of the TLF allows that the agreement for the first of this organisation affiliated companies, and then in the event of an extension by the minister for the entire profession. 
This will be the case "in a very short period of time ", assured Bussereau. 
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the process. 
The federation FNTR lambasted a "fraudulent trading ", because the 100 million euro" were the sector to offset a portion of the carbon tax has already been promised. " 
The Secretary of State for transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but the to the approaching Christmas days, laments the Unostra. 
For the association Otre threatens the agreement "small and medium-sized companies in the sector over the next 12 months, a great digging."

Turkish constitutional court resolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences 
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the pro-Kurdish main party in the country; a decision on the immediate angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul. 
This decision threatens to complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in the 25 years of conflict to an end. 
The "party for a democratic society" (DTP) was dissolved, because they had become a "site for activities for the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.

The decision followed an in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya operational procedures. He accused the DTP, the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is considered by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. 
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase the PKK rebels.

The verdict of the Constitutional Court transmits the government, which is seeking to accommodate the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, with the support of the PKK by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflict. 
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a dissolution to a resurgence of tensions in the southeast Anatolia could lead, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in recent weeks led to clashes with the police. 
Since the announcement of the Court, thousands of demonstrators outside the premises of the DTP millions in the city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.

Hundreds of people also marched in Istanbul.

"Turkey can this (Kurdish, Anm. that editorial) issue not on the basis of a party," he told the press. 
The government, consisting of a party that has emerged from the Islamist movement, regretted the decision. 
"We oppose on principle against the closure of the parties. 
That does not solve the problems, "Energy Minister Taner Yildiz. 
"This decision is a frustrating the democratic opening, which was promoted by the government," the political market observers Ahmet island. 
"It is obviously on a reaction from the PKK," he added. 
On Thursday, the PKK to an attack in which three days earlier, seven soldiers in the north of Turkey died. It was one of the most brutal attacks of recent months. 
New Silicon-Valley 
For many years it was considered secret city, for Western visitors inaccessible. 
Selenograd, one in ten districts of the capital, Moscow, was in the Soviet Union, a strict bewachter location for secret defence research. 
Today, the community with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the Moscow Centre, as "Russian Silicon Valley ". 
Major research and production facilities for micro and nano electronics are here. 
Since September 2008 representatives Selenograds had contacts to Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the Uniinstituten and the firms of Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ). 
There have been several mutual visits and now signed on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "protocol on closer cooperation."

Scientific exchanges 
It is a continuous scientific exchanges. 
But it is also about economic relations. 
The FIZ firms will be on the growing Russian market. 
Conversely, want to acquire Russian science firms contracts in Germany. 
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies. 
These include the Moscow Institute for electron technology, the big corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika. 
The community was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for the defence research. 
Selenograd (literally translated as "green city ") got its name from the forested hills landscape, in which the research institutes are embedded. 
Stuttgart brake 
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough. 
For the supporters of the project is purely and simply "the new heart of Europe ". 
Right. S21 is much more than the low of a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which the City of Baden-Württemberg capital for a decade in utter chaos construction sites. 
Stuttgart 21 is from the spirit of the 1980's. 
Head stations with tracks, in the middle of the city, were at that time as transport technical fossils of the 19th century, as a modern rail transport, as it was a lot of time, umzuspannen locomotives from behind forward. 
Briefly, to go further. 
And that is why the head stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich. 
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, about half-way through the trans-European rail route between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - so the slogan of "the heart of Europe ". 
S21 will now actually addressed, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality. 
Even very ambitious planners have realised that it is in the and the Bavarian city almost unaffordable to implement the deeper. 
Head stations have no entry and exit problem any more, since modern turning trains with locomotives and tax cars at both ends. 
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21, beyond the ICE-building route after Ulm is now being addressed. 
Regional and local politicians have. 
The train makes with, because the risks of the largest infrastructure einzelprojekts of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state company. 
The project is still reasonably justified. 
New city area, which is the computer generated graphics of the planners - with a lot of green. 
For the transport system rail is harmful. 
The transit station and the routes expansion are intended for passenger transport, which - typically 1980s - huge growth. 
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost carriers. 
Modern transport policy, but it must first to strengthen the freight transport, because the transport by rail is much cleaner than by lorries on the roads. 
But the new route is not because of intense climbs for freight trains. 
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects. 
Good six billion euros in Schwäbischen are buried. 
This is the official number. 
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion for realistic. 
It is, in the next decade will lack the money to other hubs and Engstellen in the network. 
A total of 60 major projects are on the list of the Transport Ministry. 
One of the most important is the development of good 180 kilometres through the Rheintal. 
Since 1987, is being built on the route in slow motion. 
It would be needed, right here on the tube. 
But S21 will act as a brake. 
The rhine valley route is the bottle neck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe. 
Government is considering verdict on the Airport. 
The provincial government has in the Wiesbadener land left open whether it against the judgment of the hessischen administrative Court (VGH) a night ban in review. 
The CDU / FDP coalition have asked experts to the more than 400 pages VGH judgment legally, economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said. 
The VGH in Kassel on this day in writing that the country in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway at Frankfurt airport the night ban. 
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p. m., as the country's government, was not with the legal protection of the population against noise at night. 
The coalition until 4 January must decide whether it against the judgment in review. 
The opposition criticized the suspension and on the representatives of the government to abandon a revision to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig. 
SPD party chief Torsten Schäfer Gümbel CDU and FDP to come back to their prior to the election promises to a night ban. Otherwise, it is a "breach ". 
It is hellishly difficult if you must keep its word, Green chief Tareq Al Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We hold word ". 
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel back, the regional government, with "Rechtsverdreherei and sleight of hand" to their night flights. 
A precise legal examination need their time. 
The coalition did not on the basis of a "quick first impression" operate. 
We need a legally certain Entscheiung, said Stefan Müller (FDP). 
So, as the opposition, the statements of his group never ban on night flights. 
US banks to pay back aid 
The troubled U.S. big banks Strip their government shackles. 
The Bank of America, on Wednesday, the aid from the Bank rescue fund TARP amounting to a total of 45 billion dollars (well 30 billion euros) in one fell swoop.

Quick election 
It was then everything faster than expected. 
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board the editor-in-chief Nicholas Brender had pushed out, the station can present a successor.

Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brenders dismissal was a bitter defeat for Schächter, an erwartbare, however. 
Because the Union majority on the board had already signaled weeks before the election, Brender not want to confirm in office. 
Had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the hessische Prime Minister Roland Koch. 
With the argument, Brender had lost the news of the ZDF in ratings, he rejected another term of the highly regarded chief journalist. 
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was castigated. 
Finally, even 35 Staatsrechtler had interfered in the debate, the chefs as unconstitutional. 
Nothing came of it. 
The person 
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen. 
He studied politics, education and Romanistik. 
After that, he worked in the South West radio and the Frankfurter Rundschau. 
In 1983, Frey are scoring on ZDF, firstly on the "today-journal." 
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal officer's chief journalist; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of "morning magazine "; by 2001, head of the foreign policy; since then, head of the ZDF-Capital studios. 
The Greens announced after the dismissal Brenders who was elected on Wednesday by the industries leaf medium magazine for journalists of the year, a constitutional complaint. 
Koch's adversary in the board, the rheinland pfälzische Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week, the countries should change the ZDF-state Treaty so that staff proposals of the Intendanten cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority. 
An excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF, however. 
Brenders voraussichtlicher successor Peter Frey had recommended to the board of directors with a bold move - when he criticised the body immediately after the dismissal that. 
Thanks to this Belegs journalistic independence Belegs both Schächter without loss of face for the post of chief journalist nominate and elect the board, without the suspicion, a supporters into office. 
In the party arithmetic is to the left-wing liberals. 
The Study will entrümpelt 
Partial success for the students: After a year of education strike drew the Culture Ministers of the countries on Thursday a: at a meeting of Ministers and university rectors conference, both sides agreed to improve conditions in Bachelor and master. 
The students should be able to handle their studies. 
In particular, they agreed to reduce the testing burden: basically every studies module only with a single test. 
Moreover, the workload of students reviewed and "a realistic and reasonable ". 
Politics and universities also want the recognition of audit services between the universities within and outside Germany. 
The countries committed themselves to common structural targets for Bachelor and Masters more flexible. 
Different countries regulations should not be beyond. 
Less tests 
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, Culture ministers and Uni rector the saying of the better Studierbarkeit in the mouth. 
Now it was the first time, with a specific content. 
The so-called accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of audits in part: "each module includes usually with only one test," it says in a 30 - page document, which is intended to regulate the authorisation of courses in part. 
With the "significant reduction of the examination, said the accreditation Council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a" trend should be stopped, the Studierbarkeit significantly disrupted. " 
In addition, the "Studierbarkeit" future "the decisive criterion" in the design. 
Modules as content are "strictly to examine" whether "unnecessary Einengungen of students in the choice of 
Events "would be avoided. 
The students had "entitled to maintain margins, the own initiative and promote ". 
The rules should apply to the approval of new, but also in the review of existing studies. 
This must all five years' reakkreditiert "- which means that it will take until 2015, until all the courses were reviewed. 
Responsible for federal far ten accreditation agencies, which are the set up by the countries. 
The Culture Minister had urged the countries in October "with vigour ", on the agencies that the material wealth is not too big and not too stringent verification regime. 
In individual Länder universities and colleges with the country's ministries have already agreed to take appropriate measures. 
As the only country said in Rhineland-Palatinate for the further development of the Bologna process additional funds. 
The money for the universities, especially Tutorenprogramme set up and studies advice and review and strengthen. 
Country and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros. 
At the beginning of 2010, wants to introduce an amendment of the higher education law to parliament. 
This is for the conclusion of a study model only one more test. 
The study design should be more flexible, and the recognition of performance certificates to other universities and access to the master easier. 
By the end of next year should be reviewed all studies of the country on their Studierbarkeit. 
The government and opposition had argued on Thursday again on the studies conditions in the country. 
In addition to praise, though, there was also criticism of the decisions. 
The Federal Bureau of Juso hochschulgruppe called for the organisation of education policy should not more "behind closed doors," the minister and university rectors. 
After the latest educational strikes should now also the students as "have a say." 
Support the future graduates from the President of the university rectors' conference (HRK), Margaret winter coat: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers, with which the HRK on a common reform paper. 
The union education and science (GEW) went the Bonn process as a whole does not go far enough: it calls for a legal claim, which each graduates with a Bachelor degree access to a secondary Masters Course. 
On the other hand, countries must ensure that the current generation of Bachelor tomorrow with the best possible conditions studies available, so GEW board member Andreas cellar. 
The countries need to hire more professors. 
At A freer access to the master, however, the culture minister. 
More than a footnote to Herta Müller 
In Germany and is nice almost no control... "is the first line of a poem by the Lyrikers Werner Söllner, in which this in disturbing language snatches the arrival experience of dissidents, who won the freedom, but at the same time has lost its language. 
The 1951 in romania's Banat born Werner Söllner had first as German and English teachers in Bucharest and later as Lektor in a children's book publishing, before he worked in 1982 after Frankfurt am Main. 
Söllner is with various literary prizes, in 1993, the legendary Frankfurt Poetikvorlesungen at the Goethe University, and since 2002, he is head of the Hessischen literature Forum in Frankfurt. 
For considerable außerliterarisches stir last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, the "German literature in Romania in the mirror and Zerrspiegel their Securitate files." 
Clearly unsettled and relocate Söllner read out a statement in which he rumäniendeutschen writer colleagues, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his cooperation as' for the Romanian Securitate. 
Together with some of those present Söllner 1989 had received the German language prize. 
The recruitment attempts have begun creeping, first in 1971. 
I am, Söllner, "anyone who is against attempts to intimidate the Securitate not enough." 
The lyricist Werner Söllner IM Walter. 
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize honours for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary dispute with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule the literary scene and, in particular, the Community of the German authors from Romania shaken by a case that the throes and the cowardice of a political system based on monitoring and spying. 
Werner Söllner is, so far one can say after bisherigem knowledge, not only the perpetrators, but also victims. 
In his Securitate-acts IM Walter have played a role, said after the confession Söllners literature scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter. 
He had it in for him at the time sensitive points ", "Markel. 
It is a moral need to make this comment. 
Söllners statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, surprise is the commitment of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service, however. 
Germany has been a cosy reserve for Securitate-spy, Herta Müller had already written in July at the time, they had their own acts, 914 pages, read. 
The people concerned, so we must presume, and in some case may also have known what clear name behind the aliases Sorin, Voicu and even Walter was. 
Unlike the now very procedure safe sighting of the Stasi-files dealing with the legacy of the Securitate monitoring still very vague. 
A systematic education in recent years and has been hampered. 
One of the Birthler agency National Council for processing the Securitate-files (CNSAS) was set up in 1999, the publication of the files, but since then has been rather slow. 
Only since 2005, there is a law that regulates the administration of the files. 
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar dismissive about the Prize. 
They have a psychosis, finally did it only once. 
The infamy of power said quite openly in the form of freedom of expression. 
Certainly include the case Söllner, as so often in connection with sneak guilt, inevitable questions. 
Why only now? Who was hurt? The measured response of the Zuhörenden Söllners commitment gives hope that the continuation of this chapter of knowledge rather than blame and shame will be determined. 
The Genese of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote. 
Sättigungsbeilage Champions League. 
It felt as if there is a smart gekleideter Außendienstler from a very nice Christmas party at a sporting goods manufacturers had distributed Goodies, as the new VfB-coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag of Ausrüsters a quarter of a hour after midnight in a herbeigerufene C class. 
The man with the striking hell was because of him chauffieren foreign city. 
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and besoffen before luck was the 55 jährige any more. 
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow is the work is continuing. 
Or just right. 
In the words of the first three days earlier: "we have reached the eighth final ", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 - success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania," but we must not be fooled by the success: It will be a brutal battle against the descent. " 
The "much more important task" on Sunday. 
Then, in Mainz the royal class performance in the league. 
And the perfectly revealed weaknesses again after the rapid three gates by Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11). 

The eighth finals of The Champions League (Hinspiele 16/17 + 23/24 February / arranging re-matches 9/10 + 16/17 March) on 18 December in Nyon scrutineers. 
The joy on the fulminanten commencement of Babbel-successor remained. 
Not only the supposed saviours, the uncertain Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, dedication and the game. 
I have received on the players and told them that they should go back to their strengths, and have to be brave souls plumber Gross, said that as simple-sounding recipe for success under Therapeut Babbel but had any effect. 
He has a certain magic, Babbel defender Jens Lehmann, "if a new impetus, sometimes things happen in football, which would not have thought possible." 
And Sami Khedira, after weeks of violation break thanks to its dynamic equal to the best players on the field, the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh air" and the operation of the new superiors: "He is a man of action and discipline. 
That is what we need in the current situation. " 
Under Babbel had it obviously lacking. 
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet out of the woods, warns sport Horst Heldt Board 
The VfB Stuttgart needs but especially constancy. 
As Gross, players and managers, the victory against a weakened and completely swamped defense of the Romanian guests exaggerate. 
They have also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening, Khedira. 
And sports executive Horst Heldt reminded that a season goal has been achieved, but is still far off. 
We are not yet on the mountain. 
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after the first home victory since three months after celebrating was not, was due to the events of the weekend, in the form of a television interviews before the start of gate-keepers Jens Lehmann fresh. 
There are decisions that other and not the Jens, countered the Lehmanns harsh criticism. 
The had accused the board leadership weakness and the change of coach to pressure pubertierender fans. 
Also that his free day after games had been withdrawn, Lehmann took as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy. 
Lehmanns statements were "characterised by pure selfishness," keilte Heldt back and announced consequences for the final man. 
They will probably not friends for life, the two forty years. 
After all, but they were with all other agree that without the preparatory work by the abgelöste coach team teaching and vindictive, strong idea would not have been possible. 
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag. 
In the World Cup Fight heavyweight 
Hitziges duel in Bern: repeatedly provoked challenger Kevin Johnson world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures. 
But after 12 hard rounds of Ukrainians defended his heavy weight-title after version of the WBC. 
The verdict of The judges was unanimously. 
Hamburg - Vitaly Klitschko remains box-world champion in the heavyweight. 
The 38 - year-old champion after version of the Association of WBC defeated in the night of Saturday in Bern the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109). 
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008. 
Previously, the Ukrainians was twice world champion of associations WBO and WBC. 
Unfortunately, with the K., all have not worked. 
Klitschko built his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, he had twice on the basis of breaches. 
Challenger Johnson in 24 fight the first defeat. 
Around 17, 000 spectators in the Berne arena wanted to dictate the 2.02 metres wide Klitschko fight especially with his left hand. 
The 11 centimetres smaller Johnson, before the duel of the end of the Klitschko-era, but the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko his dangerous rights not crucial to the goal. 
In fact the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only through the rounds. 
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows met the world champion but only rarely. 
After all, he is only the second Boxer after Timo Hoff man in the year 2000, with Klitschko on the full distance of 12 rounds. 
The challenger had before the fight in the Swiss capital for some. 
He offended Klitschko as "ugly zombie "," not right ". 
The cradles was the champion then on Friday to provoke, Johnson solar glasses of the nose, "in order to be able to see his eyes." 
The fourth victory after Klitschkos comeback

After nearly four years he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and "his" WBC-belt, which he had made. 
This year he defeated in his Titelverteidigungen Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September, Chris Arreola from the United States. 
I have in this fight only a stroke and am physically very well in form, Klitschko had justified the rapid return to the ring. 
His dream remains, but the unification of all four major titles in the family. 
Brother Vladimir is world champion of associations WBO and IBF. 
The belt of the WBA but the Briton David Haye, after this in November the 2.13 meter Nikolai Walujew entthronen. 
Haye had cancelled earlier in the summer of a planned for September fight against Vitali Klitschko. 
Supposedly, whose promotion society now the fight against Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium. 
Kunduz case 
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green group chief Jürgen Trittin, Defense Minister Guttenberg because of false information to Kunduz affair as a liar. 
The Social Democrats and Left demand information from the Chancellor. 
Hamburg / Berlin - Following the recent findings on air raid of Kunduz, the opposition defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) a deliberate deception. 
The minister said the deadly bombing of two petrol burden-if trains in September "knowingly the falsehood," said Green group chief Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD-news programme "". 
It is called the landläufig: He lied. 
The order to kill, was in disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). 
This is the substance of the report, the NATO had read, Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said. 
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack not only a destruction of abducted vices, but also two Taliban leaders targeted to kill. 
In the German Kunduz-commander Colonel Klein requested U.S. air strikes, according to NATO report up to 142 people have been killed or injured. 
Green, the Social Democrats and Left on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU), immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident. 
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy, and whether chancellor, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green Renate Künast. 
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism. 
The chancellor did not on specific operations in the German army in Afghanistan, he said. 
On Saturday, were also doubts about the portrayal of the Ministry of the background of the dismissal of Generalinspekteur Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert. 
According to the mirror, the two Guttenberg properly and fully informed about the background of the tank vice-attack. 
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and denied the minister sensitive details. 
In the context of the two top officials said, however, that the Ministry of Defence even pointed to several reports, including a two-way document of the befehlhabenden Colonel Klein and a field hunters report. 
Wichert is now in a letter for clarification of the facts, the Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper ". 
He has not yet received a reply, it says. 
The ministry said on Saturday not to the accusations and pointed out that in the Committee of Inquiry of the Bundestag, which will be formed next Wednesday. 
Dream worlds 
Some people see in wachem state images and hear voices, others do not see or hear. 
Not only in mental health and drug binge blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality. 
As long as it is happening in their sleep, everything is in order. 
If we with closed eyes in our dark rooms, we should Unbound the wildest ideas and imagination entities. 
Anyone who witnessed in a situation, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world mostly as crazy or drug addicts, at least as a Sonderling. 
But such images and voices arise not only in mental health or drug binge. 
Blame our imagination: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint pictures or to write novels, sometimes to ensure that the borders between dream, fantasy and reality. 
Traumartig modified guard awareness conditions can occur in many different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case of madness. 
Although cause and effect may distinguish the visions of the Mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, schamanische Entrückungszustände, psychosis and hallucinations but on similar processes. 
Hallucinations or delusions, if the balance of the neural messenger substances of the brain - especially, Noradrenalin, serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted. 
Complex hallucinations and wahnhafte thoughts are very often during a schizophrenic psychosis. 
The gravity has no power over him 
The context of madness and dream, philosophers and doctors since ancient times. 
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, 1861 noted a "great similarity of misleading one with a dream conditions" for Sigmund Freud was the dream even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, Wahnbildungen, false perceptions of such a ". 
It is the autumn of 2001, when Henning T. in a comic figure. 
His body is two dimensions and quietschbunt. 
The gravity has no power more about him, he is hanging in the bedroom ceiling. 
He senses a kick. 
Behind him saying vicious with blood red, distorted Fratzen, zähnefletschend. 
They hunt him, him with serious, inflammatory boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body. 
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio. 
He can no longer tolerate, the voices that the attack and insult him. 
Henning T. snaps two cable from the stereo, knotet a noose and fortified them in a hole in the ceiling. 
He is rising on a loudspeaker and is tightening the noose around the neck. 
The. 
The noose resolves itself. 
This should be a lesson to you, the voices in trommelfellzerfetzendem chorus, "walk in the clinic and let you cure!" 
Today, Henning T. 40 years old, he has seen six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first in nearly 20 years. 
It was triggered by LSD. 
His diagnosis is schizoaffektive-paranoid psychosis, moreover, he is bi-low, he takes medication to combat depression, mania, the schizophrenia. 
He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. 
In the psychosis, I have seen worst fear and deepest despair, he says. 
The images are cruel reality 
About one percent of the population affected at least once in life with schizophrenia, in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second most common illness after the depression. 
In an acute schizophrenic affected mostly can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they are In a state of to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or paranoia. 
The vote is particularly widespread hearing voices, or comment on dialogisieren. 
Also optical hallucinations are not rare. 
The person is important to separate what is trivial, the brain can no longer ausfiltern disturbing signals, the awareness is awash with impressions. 
As the dream also opens the psychosis the floodgates for a flood of ideas and fantasies, the deeper awareness classes come from. 
The reality of perception in the psychosis is subjektzentriert, says Professor Thomas fox, Oberarzt the clinic for General psychiatry in the Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg. 
The Schizophrene finds itself in the middle of it, everything has a significance to him. 
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will, as the dream, overwhelmed by what has happened and it cannot be. 
Schizophrenic feel so often threatened, controlled and manipulated. 
A reality is not possible, the images are cruel reality, excluded awakening. 
Once in life to have experienced a Halluzination 
Unlike in the dream, says fox, "but the sinnliche and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in the psychosis, basically." 
The obsessive thoughts and hallucinations based in reality, the alienation of the Erlebens will take place in real terms. 
Why is our brain antics, researchers still puzzle. 
Exceptional conditions can lead to every that he loses the reality, says fox. 
But not everyone will develop a psychosis. 
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determinants. 
Researchers assume that involved minimal brain damage. 
We suspect that the neuronale maturation of the brain in an early stage of development will be disrupted by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fox explained. 
But it remains a mystery, as the disruption of the neural system, which is also first over many years. 
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be a trigger for psychosis, if the question is there. 
Also halluzinogene drugs can trigger psychosis, because they are in the transmitter system. 
If our brain hot runs 
The nutcases, Psychotiker suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs, in order to get rid of them, others give money for drugs in order to get, says the Lübecker psychology professor Erich caste. 
Whether mirrors images as pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of the position. 
Caste collects for ten years, reports of hallucinations and Trugerscheinungen, last year, he has his results in the book "the unreal world in our head ". 
Hallucinations are among the typical effects of psychosis, but also of astonishing many other diseases. 
These include mental disorders, such as Border line or depression often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease and Schädelhirntraumata. 
Surprisingly, hallucinates under certain conditions, even the brain healthy people. 
Hallucinations, caste, from memory content, which would normally be withheld. 
They arise when, in which sensory processing, hyperactive or too little; if our brain is overheating or even if stimulation lacking. 
Drugs can trigger this state just as brain damage or a psychosis. 
But also appeal of deprivation, stress, love grief or other mental exceptional situations. 
In recent studies, up to a third of those polled said that at least once in life to have experienced a hallucinations. 
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and visited the school. 
A normal girl, really. 
If it is not the images and voices. 
In the break, it can happen that a schlaksiger boy with long, dark hair it addresses. 
When he replies, the classmates surprisingly - no one else sees or hears these boys. 
They think the timid girl for a versponnene Tagträumerin, but Sarah K. not dreaming, it knows it. 
She is awake, She hears and sees these boys, just as the girls in the bank alongside to see. 
You can even feel his presence, at least for moments. 
A pleasant feeling is that it may be the boy. 
Am I crazy?, asks them sometimes. 
But she knows that this boy and the other trick images are not real, and then disappear again. 
At night, are the phenomena most frightening 
The images are Often also a burden. 
If you are sitting in the class room, they can follow the teaching material sometimes not, because the teachers in their eyes and ears just unveils a new classmates, while he explained for all other hör- and visible from the bar of mathematical equations. 
At night are the phenomena most frightening. 
If they are in their dark room to sleep, which is far too little and too late, they often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees the Fratzen or the girl with the bleeding wounds of arms and legs, before their open or closed eyes. 
Let me in, to the characters. 
Parents and friends told them nothing, which would be crazy. 
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old. 
In the last year she has insisted the baccalaureate and lives with her friend. 
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped. 
Since the Internet contact with the psychologists castes, she knows that she is not crazy. 
Obsession is also a work of art from despair 
If someone is socially isolated or suffers allure withdrawal, he has, in all probability after a while hallucinations, says castes. 
I suspect that the brain is underemployed, and even for his entertainment. 
Sarah K., an Einzelkind, had as a little girl fear of other children, often played alone. 
Their hallucinations began with 13, when they learned that the man they called dad, since they can think of, not their leiblicher father. 
As visual and audio hallucinations the same brain areas are active, the real impressions and noise, it is affected as Sarah K. hard to distinguish mirrors images and reality. "Every experience," says caste, "will take place in the brain, the reality is there. 
Hallucinations are also images of the brain, that is why they are so real. " 
Night dream images of digesting caste as a form of hallucinations. 
The hallucinations of healthy do not differ fundamentally from those of an acute psychosis. 
In contrast to the schizophrenic are mentally healthy in the situation, their images as unreal. 
Caste advises his patients, therefore, the hallucinations as a special ability. 
Border state between dream and hallucinations. 
In our very bewusstseinszentrierten world imaginary experience, unfortunately most pathologisiert, says Michael Schmidt Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief doctor of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of Florence Nightingale-Hospital in Düsseldorf. 
A psychosis is a heavy, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative - obsession is also a work of art from despair. 
Schmidt Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroide experience form, a particular form of traumartig modified guard awareness. 
Oneiroide are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, the Erlebende for real and he cannot distinguish downstream from the. 
The oneiroide consciousness state in trauma or illness extreme situations, for example, in Polyradikulitis patienten in full awareness of a motor paralysis. 
If a person of self- and world loss is threatened by continued, total impotence, it replaces the life-threatening reality through its own, imaginary world, the reality is, says schmidt-degen hard. 
A kind of border state between dream and hallucinations. 
Since the deal with a situation in reality is not possible, a world of change, but the real situation in the Imagination. 
An intensive form of Sinn Foundation and meaning in An intolerable situation, the people own ability, not in a loss of consciousness submerged. 
Everything is real, later in the memory 
Even the Zürcher art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his Oneiroid-experiences in his book "heart change" as a bailout of the soul. 
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valves operation, followed by a heart transplant posted on travel, while his body to the intensive care unit for Bewegungslosigkeit. 
Claussen appears in a self-created world, other times and places: He is seen as bettlägerigen, old man, on board a Zugsanatoriums, a robot guarding his health. 
He lives in the early Middle Ages under nobles manufacturing drugs from blood. 
By a Greeks on the motorcycle in his home country, surfing with his hospital bed in Firnschnee the Alps and a Korean Mafioso. 
He is completely in the imagined happened, everything is real, later in the memory. 
These internal travel for Claussen differ fundamentally from any dream. 
Dream is a different situation, he describes his experience. 
In contrast, the memories from mental travel even after years and in secondary details abundantly clear. 
More and more even than really Erlebtes. 
The intensity of this Erlebens goes beyond the horizon of our other secular life experience, says the psychiatrist schmidt-degen hard. 
Ultimately, show Oneiroide, psychoses, hallucinations and drugs binge, how fragile our internal copies of external reality in the guards. 
Any change of the condition, say the psychologist caste, "can lead to a Verformung of what we call reality." 
An experience which can also be enriching. 
The snow fall can come 
Burda 
Children should take the publishing house with 27 years 
The new publishing chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long run will be Hubert Burda company in the hands of his two children, he told the mirror. 
The holding company should in future to 100 percent of the family. 
Hamburg - the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term. 
Both children inherit with 27 years and have the firm will to enter the companies, said the 69 jährige the mirror. 
The details we have regulated as a precautionary measure. 
The question of whether they are active in The company, then. 
The question of whether they are in a position to do so. 
We cannot ado 7500 staff his children, if they are not sufficient. 
This brings the children, and the company. 
Burda had announced on Thursday that he is withdrawing from January by the board chair, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen appointed as his successor.

With regard to the cases Schickedanz and Schaeffler Burda said that family businesses are not safe from the sinking: "this was always families who were infected by a capital addiction, which have speculated away completely and thought they could rise as the major player. 
My strategy was never. 
He had "never world power dreams," Burda. 
I am not as the political Präzeptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I do not want to play the game in the World League with 'Time ', these shops are too great. 
The promises of FonPeek 
Peek is limited, a device that can read his e-mails, without a chance to see certain annexes or to surf the Internet. 
It has enjoyed his five minutes of fame, as the magazine Time to one of the products of the year. 
To see it on the streets, it is unlikely, but the idea is, nevertheless, especially for young people of interest. 
In contrast to the Smartphones Peek costs very little and has a very favourable flat rate, for example, only half of the price of the flat rate of an iPhone. 
After the company has seen the success that it has two new devices on the market: one, that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a life-long free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, in which they must pay a six times higher price. 
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version. 
It has the same limits, as his American counterpart, however, has a surprise. 
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe. 
Those who travel with a Smartphone around the world, already know what it means to have all the data in order to read his e-mails, once you cross the border, or if you are desperately seeking a café with WiFi (or a link with Fon). 
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly tempting and should actually be possible for a long time. 
It is true that some telephone providers already offer specific contracts and prices for abroad, but in my experience, you need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses to read all the fine print. 
The repeated criticism from the European Commission in relation to affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe remained almost always ignored. 
Outside of their own country has always been afraid to read his e-mails and rightly so. 
That a small device as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name of Fon, although it has no Wifi / WLAN) this kind of tariffs can offer, means that the telephone providers are slowly but surely rethink and start to various ways to consider how they can use their data network. 
Kindle is another good example in its prices is the downloads of books and other questions on the Internet. 
Without Vetrag and without snags. 
It is an internetfähiges equipment and pay for it only once, at the time of purchase, and not every month. 
And that is exactly what I expect one day of FonPeek expect a buying opportunity with lifelong Internet access as it offers the Peek already in the United States. 
And that is not because I want to buy it. 
I read my e-mails with the telephone, thank you. 
But I expect this, because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer. 
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system. 
The fetish colour of Michelle 
Yellow is undoubtedly the favourite colour of the American First Lady. 
At the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States appeared in a dress and a coat of paint and has the same colour re-elected him in his, without doubt, second most important moment in his life: to accompany the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. 
Michelle Obama has on two occasions very similar models, except that it was almost the same colour - a bright green yellow - the clothes from three parts - dress, jacket and coat from the same substance, and it was something großförmig gesticktes or a neck chain. 
It even goes so far as that at first sight, It seems that the first Lady of the United States, the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion. 
However, the two clothes but very much in the Stoffart, from which they are made. 
At the inauguration, she wore a dress from head and in Oslo from gemusterten kid. 
The accessories were different: the first time green shoes with semi-high paragraphs and the second time a änhliches model, but goldfarben. 
Also, the hair style every time was different: the hair were on this occasion as hair wreath, with the previous, the hair. 
75% of working mothers, because of their maternity problems in the work 
The discrimination in the work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who wish to have children. 
This result is the CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for women study "fertility and career women in Spain." 
The survey of 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market because of their maternity. 
The study makes clear that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of work they perform. 
Those of you who of the House no other activity, only part-time work or have no fixed contract of employment, more mothers and have more children. 
In contrast, postpone the women with a solid job, particularly in the public sector, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children. 
"the women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a solid job their first child on average only 3.7 years after the draw, a figure that to 4.1 years for women with solid employment, which took longer to achieve this and learn together, and the first child until much later. 
It also has the kind of work a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar on the contraceptive preparedness, "explains the CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado. 
The level of education is another factor, at the age of the women in the marriage and the first child must be taken into account. 
According to the poll is the age at the time of the marriage and the first child the higher, the higher the level of education. 
This difference was in the women the same age. 
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years, depending on whether they are only the main education or higher education, on average, each with 25.1 or 32.1 mother For the first time. 
There is, depending on their level of education, another difference between the women. 
While the women with Hauptschlussabschluss before its first permanent employment and their first child, make it the women with a medium or high school exactly the other way around and only a permanent employment and marry later and then get their first child, Delgado says.

The trip is exciting and Vicent saves either to horrors still Erleuchtungen. 
Except that this book is a köstlicher readers enjoy, it is also a moving invitation to read and again. 
Here are a few sequences from the book. 
On Albert Camus: "Reading his sides I found that the Mediterranean is no Sea, but rather a spiritual, almost voluptuous driving, just as I have always felt, without words: the joy in contrast to the disastrous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God." 
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorischer Christian, he wrote about what is in the blood, not in his brain, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an umwerfenden poetic humour, without any sense of how the knife, which almost killed him." 
On Graham Greene: "Our man was of this woman with a passion which lasted for 13 years, so in its ranks, in whose meat the emotions on grounds of adultery with the pleasure of remorse united, a spiritual privilege, which was in the sky on the basis of the." 
On James Joyce's "Ulysses" was in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000er summit of world literature, you must climb on the north wall, on the wall, the best climber try. " 
On William Faulkner: "this was a comical Kauz. 
He said sometimes about himself that he would be the legacy of a landowner county and other times, he said that he was the son of a Black and a Krokodils. 
Both dreams of a certain Grö Β e. " 
Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer, the hideous cry on a bridge from those personality from Munich, so that his response until well into the night of the 20th century on his literary way out hallte. This he made in a journey that he fled from themselves and with a speech full of violence before the worms posterity. 
Dorothy Parker: "One day they kniete and bettete: My dear God, I would ask you to do everything in your power to ensure that I finally leaving, as a woman." 
Joseph Conrad: "At his grave are these verses of Spencer engraved:" the sleep after the effort / after the storm of port, / the calm after the war, / after a clear life you find favor on death. " 
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she had always their depression. 
The husband took it with utter normality, when she told him that Eduard VII it between the Azaleen ausspionierte or the birds sang in Greek. 
It is not a single other case, where the man known as much patience and love in a Neurotikerin, whose literary talent much gröer than their craziness. " 
On Pío Baroja: "What made Martín-Santos because otherwise, than to try to inspire Joyce in Baroja? 
What intended because Benet, if he Baroja led to the arms of Faulkner? 
What made Cela because, apart from the glory to destroy a person, so that he can put on this pedestal? " 
Cowardly aggression 
My 70 - year-old mother was last week by our city in the town of Fuenlabrada, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years alongside their and our dog herliefen, our dog is a Mischling, we have taken from the animal sanctuary and weighs six kilos, and then out of the blue missed him two Fußtritte and injured him so hard. 
Our outrage is not in words, because it is incomprehensible to us, where the fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is, of course, on the leash. 
In the suffocation attack, a woman who was walking, they wanted to chastise these people as a result of the incident, they even feared for their own lives, because if a dog attacked a dog, he will be the same, perhaps with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with each, the weaker than he is. 
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighbourhoods at five o'clock in The afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday. 
The dog has geheult all day long. 
Of course, we have, in a police department reported, however, we have great doubts about whether it will bring anything and to prevent any prejudice from the outset, we would just make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards. 
Our indignation about what has happened has led us to this incident. 
We cannot understand what must be in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a defenceless animal fun, on an animal that We love, society and friendship. 
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and people. 
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helms 
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for road safety (Fesvial) a campaign to promote the helmet use, especially among the younger motorcyclists launched, as both companies announced today. 
This initiative is to draw attention to the importance of the helmet use, since it is ultimately the only protection element, the head injury or even death can prevent in the event of a motorcycle accident. 
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to the road safety, the "far more than just the design and manufacture of products with every day more and more secure" and confirmed that it with other actions educational and informative nature contribute to this objective every day to come a step closer. 
This new campaign to promote the helmet use on the motorcycle, which, under the slogan "to be or not to be" is, in a first phase posters of about 500 motorcycle workshops, in order to achieve the best possible spread. 
Finally, Michelin stressed that the road safety "a constant concern" of the company, and it is precisely for the reason that they are manufacturers of tyres for two rädige vehicles are obliged to see that one of its main objectives the development of safer products. 
The sale of small trucks is rising again something 
After almost two years of the car market for small trucks finally beginning to see light at the end of the dark tunnel. 
The 9.425 vehicles, which were approved in November in Spain, represent an increase of 12.6% in the year 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase at all after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam presented figures. 
These good figures are currently only with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison in November 2008, which is a particularly bad Verkausjahr with a drop of 60% on the previous year. 
However, we must remember that, apart from the increase in the last month, the overall admissions of these 11 months still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year. 
Since January, a total of 95.853 vehicles were sold in this figure but all vehicles from which the vans market is: descendants of passenger cars, vans, small vans and lighter vans / chassis. 
Furthermore, are still the same storm clouds in the sky, what the demand of the most affected, because even if some of the vehicles purchased by individuals, most of the sales to small and medium-sized enterprises, which almost 100% of all cases the purchase with a third-party financing. 
We need to these restrictions, which are the result of the tap the credit institutions, there are other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation. 
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E little help. 
This plan, however, is not only to individuals, the self-employed and small businesses have a right to a vans up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions, it must not exceed 160 grams per mileage, want to buy, but the low sales figures speak for themselves. 
Just yesterday had Ganvam reminded that it is part of the state, including a special attention to these small vices and, of course, also on the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses). 
The car dealers association predicts a similar year for the year 2010, just as the last, for which it with a sales shortfall (in passenger cars and SUVs) by 19%. 
The support in Bremsmanövern in critical situations is now duty 
As the Antiblockierbremssystem ABS and how it is happening now with the ESP stability control, the aid systems on the brakes in emergencies a duty equipment in European cars. 
In fact, they are already duty all newly registered passenger cars and light trucks, for the remaining vehicles was a waiting period until the end of February 2011. 
The European Union adopted by the aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems, because of their operation also help to prevent many front-rear collisions. 
The task of the Notbremsassistenten is, is more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which recognises the system on the basis of the driver carried out on the brake pedal. 
However, this system is exerting this pressure until the end. 
According to one of the components manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles commissioned study, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the Zusammenstoss no longer on the brake pedal and half of them had not slowed down with full force. 
Up to 1100 accidents 
The Bremshilfe with maximum force in the braking system and reduced the Bremszeit and therefore also the Bremsabstand, a car in the braking process. 
According to a study by the EU could each year to 1.100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians to damage, be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of Notbremsassistenten. 
It would even be fewer accidents - It is estimated that every fourth accident involving personal injury could be prevented, as the so-called intelligent seat-belt reminders popularity. 
Then there is the vehicle equipped with a system that (on radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, and at the same time, a light pressure on the brakes. 
If the driver then responded, helps him the system, to increase the pressure on the brake pedal, If it would be necessary. 
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the Zusammenstoss is inevitable, the Bremsassistent exercises maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as low as possible. 
General Motors is postponing the plan for Opel until January 
While the workforce of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, have been informed that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturers to that he needs more time to get the rescue plan for Opel. 
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, namely that the affected side their assent to each point of the plan in advance. 
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which first the workers and then the governments of the countries in which it works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010. 
Dementgegen GM assured that it in the next few days a decision on the sale of Saab will take. 
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car Bauer, so that this is a decision as soon as possible. 
GM is to stand with some potential new buyers in contact. 
One of these buyers could be Geely, which also would like to buy Volvo, however, the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper-sports cars, which the Russian group Converg backing, more and more. 
If it should come to an agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to China's BAIC. 
The decision to close at the end of the year, if it has not been sold, will also continue. 
At the helm of the Porsche Boxster Spyder 
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewel engineers used the Boxster S as a base and made it really, to make it easier to 80 kilos, and he is now only 1.275 kilogram. 
In order to create something they refrained from first on the automatic aufklappbare roof, which has been replaced by a Zeltleinwanddach with manuellem powered, so that alone has saved 21 kilograms; thanks to this model used aluminum doors as the GT3 disappear "another 15; by the removal of the air conditioning again 13; au β erdem also the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres were, a further 7 kilo; through the installation of sporting Bacquet sitzen again 12 and with the slight 19 - customs Felgen five saved again. 
Then we had achieved through the renunciation of the audio system CDR-30 again six kilos less and through the exchange of Türgriffe Griffe from substance by the lack of kilograms. 
Although he also with the Doppelkupplungsgetriebe PDK is available, the test ride with a vehicle with 6 - hand wheels, mainly on the smaller roads of California, on mountain routes, which were really very kurvig. 
In his behaviour can give him only the note perfectly. 
The reduction of its weight but has not meant that he is no longer so sure would be on the road. 
Rather, the opposite is the case: For long, we have no longer such a small and easy model, which is also a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed. 
It is a small athlete, his muscles in a low gear in the required time warm until we give him the orders, to slow to recover and then back again everything from his engine to get out... 
He makes everything He says. The car makes everything we him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as precise. 
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon. 
An engine Sound for all tastes 
The Sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and we can still raise it with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which is in the Panamera was used for the first time. 
The acceleration capacity is unimaginable brutality, whether from the foot or renewed acceleration. 
The Federungen are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable. 
The asphalt on the roads, on which we went with the Boxster Spyder, was pretty damaged, but the car meisterte the bumps. 
The electronic assistants on the whole route had almost nothing to do; and that, although we in some of these curves ice at dawn and Rollsplitt this morning. 
In summary, we can say that it is an ultra-easy car, a car, with which it has an indescribable Fahrspass, as it would otherwise rather rare and it is much more than just a slight improvement of the Boxster Ss. 
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70.831 EURO.

The Baskonia paying themselves a victory in Israel 
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many fancy players in the team against Mr Ivanovic, an excellent triumph with 82 - 91 during his visit to the complex football field of Maccabi Electra and in the first place in its group after the artigen appearance of Mirza Teletovic, with eight triple the best of his team was (29 in the assessment). 
The team from Vitoria, the significant loss of Mr Mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they had to wait until the bitter end on their victory. 
The great hits from the Perimeter with 16 valued at three times contributed significantly to their final victory. 
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Red, from the very beginning to the top of the ads. 
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already from the Perimeter came out, it was already guess that they are on the pitch with good reheated. 
It was English and Teletovic, mainly for the 18 - 20 at the end of the first quarter were responsible. 
The second quarter was little different, except that the team from Álava opted for an innenseitiges game of Barac and for the game by Eliyahu, on his return to the team with Pfiffen and applause was received, which is home to their advantage before the break (34 - 43). 
Teletovic began, as the best of his team with 13 points, including wennn "minus six" assessment of cluster already guess that this would not be the best night of Brazilian. 
Nevertheless, the game was despite the clear advantage into the break and the Makkabäer wanted to remind the Vitorianer once again that not everyone on the pitch, and thanks to the "hand of Elías" they came back into play. 
Eidson and Pnini contributed significantly to that the "yellow" the helm umdrehten (50 - 49). 
Even more disadvantages. 
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything other than dead, had to prepare a few gambits with accuracy, in order to get air and one of them came from the gun of Mirza Teletovic, with three successive almost three times and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the table einberuhigender gap of (54 - 67), the hosts at the end of the third quarter with (57 - 67) could make. 
The last quarter were Alavesen exposed and English and San Emeterio (60 - 75) already announced that they would not allow them the victory in the first thirty minutes honestly deserved away again. 
Nevertheless, resigned Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team and tried not to give their team by three points from the line (70 - 77). 
Nevertheless, and despite the cluster because Fouls was the place, not on the team of Ivanovic, defended well and although the Israelis in the last minute aufholten (80 - 85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season. 
Injuries prevented Unicaja stood up to 
Unicaja lost vociferously against Olympiacos in Greece and had to relinquish the lead in Group B of the Euro League to him, and that in a game that through the failure on the part of the players from Unicajas (free country, Lima and Archibald), particularly in the domestic game was marked the Greeks facilitated the victory. 
The team from Malaga had no fear of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship before the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money. 
Thanks to their game in the first quarter of the Andalusians start to dream. An aggresive Verteidung and three consecutive three times, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12 - 18 in the ninth minute. 
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the ereins Unicaja, even if the local team with a home match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed that the ads plaque in the 13th minute 22 - 20 in their favour, the minute in which an action almost to thuggery between the two Americans Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified. 
The Greek team began to be warm and his superiority on both halves, while the departure of the Englishman Joel free country because of a violation and the three self-inflicted mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clear traces the Unicaja. 
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian Vorspieler Linas Kleizas, with its three times, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44 - 32. 
A catch up was impossible 
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, despite its 19 losses showed superior and even managed the difference in Malaga played game with 66 - 48 in the 27th minute, which in turn, the leadership within the group. 
Unicaja tried to on the many defaults and the departure of the injured Scots Robert Archibald during the game. 
Despite the many disadvantages for Unicaja came in the 31st minute thanks to the leadership and the three times by Cook and the use of Lewis back some hope to 66 - 57. 
Nevertheless, it was impossible, since the Olympiacos as soon as he attacked and his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, was not to slow down. 
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed 37 minute basket difference to rise to 81 - 62 and Unicaja had to be beaten and had to surrender the leadership anOlympiacos.

Brazil called Zelaya a date to leave 
The Brazilian government has set the residence of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa a deadline. 
The office of President must leave the diplomatic representation at the latest on 27 January, when his mandate expires officially 
Francisco Catunda, trade delegates of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed the TV Globo that "Mel" knows that the message before that date, in which he had found since 21 September asylum must have left. 
"he is aware that he must go on 27 January, when his mandate expires on that day and he needs to find a new shelter." 
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline: "My position is to go as soon as possible, of course, with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone. 
After the elections on 29 November (where Porfirio Lobo emerged as the victor) assured Zelaya that he will stay until January in the Brazilian embassy. 
However, he tried this week to obtain refuge in Brazil. 
This, however, foundered on the refusal Zelayas, the status of an asylum seeker politician, the "de facto" government headed by Roberto Micheletti sought to impose. 
Thank you! 
After the glowing days since last spring, in which the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, is in the markets, which is not surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the broker decisions on an inherently uncertain future. 
The measure used to stabilize the markets, it was the debt with the direct purchase of assets to repay the liquidity and indirectly free hand in interest rates, the move to zero, so that in this way the banks buy assets. 
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets as well as ended and, without their heterodox policy to liquidity in question, start to throw a spanner in the works, as the BCE näc already vormachte with its annual auction next week. 
That is why investors have doubts about the ability of the world economy, the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are currently witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums. 
The Flüchtigkeiten the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses rise again, even if they are still a long way from the paranormalen amounts, which they reached at the beginning of the year. 
The states have been forced to nationalize the private risks and the public debt will rise again. 
It is now back on quality and the United States, Japan and Germany are the favorite refuge of investors, which in turn to an increase in the differences of the euro zone in regard to Germany. 
Spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability, but then came Standard Poor's and threatened with a new revision downwards on the assessment of Spain. 
On the other hand, a degree of uncertainty does not harm the defenders of moral hazard to silence the had tried again, with the leaders of the world economic policy, an awareness of what had caused it to produce, since the devastating effects, which the restriction of loans to the loss of jobs, had slowed down, as they should actually a new day thanks to action should have been. 
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai, a tribal war between the Emiren out to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also previously forecast. 
A government which conceals the public debt, elections and a new government, which is in the same direction. 
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso. 
It makes no sense that Ecofin Hungary at the beginning of the year from the external payments saves and thus gives an euro member country no longer meet its obligations. 
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens in need of aussergewhnlicchen measures with the duty to maintain the stability of state money. 
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some excesses to large sums, it would now lie within the Erwarteten. 
In the case of Spain, we need not worry, as long as the differences of public debt with the same speed as the European corporate bonuses. 
However, the European differences and reduce the Spanish, dannn would be a special Spanish risk. 
The Standard Poor's is a farce. During the early indicators of a large part of the market research institute, forcing their scenarios for the recovery and preferable scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy all the despite warnings not long life.

It is the greatest measure to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane. 
The city government spent roadmap provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.

The game in the Champions League, Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million. 
The Champions League has sichseit its creation in 1992 to a source of income for the. 
So much So that Real Madrid and Barcelona since then have taken 476.4 million, putting them at the third and fifth place of football clubs who have earned the most money in the league. 
Leaders of this list is Manchester United. 
Leaders of this list is Manchester United. 
To win the UEFA Champions League, not only fame. It is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs. 
The League has, according to UEFA to 5.362, 5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 Spanish) in this event since its establishment in the season 1992/1993, distributed. 
Real Madrid and F. C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution. 
The white club is in third place in Europe, has earned the most money through his participation and alongside the AC Milan, the only one who has won the trophy three times. 
The Catalan champion and recent winner of the former Europacups 1992 proves the fifth place. 
The list of Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, the most money through their participation in the last Champoins League. 
And that, although they have lost against Barça. 
On the other hand, Spain is only the third of the countries that einehmen through the Champions money, although it has more titles than any other (five, in contrast to four bie Italy, three in England and two in Germany). 
Distribution 
This apparent contradiction is explained by the complex money division procedure that uses the UEFA. 
In this business year does the organisation, whose president Michel Platini holds, with revenues of 1.090 million by the Champions League. 
This money is the UEFA 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs who took part in the qualification vorrunde (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million. 
In addition, those who have a participation, 3.8 million through their mere presence, in addition to the 550.000 euros for each game, which they denied. 
There is also a bonus for profits (800, 000 euros) and for a draw (400, 000 per team). The clubs who have come into the eighth finals, each received three million; the four, who came into the quarter finals, 3.3 million. 
The last four get 4 million. 
The winner earns 9 million, in contrast to the Second, the 5.2 million. 
So a football club at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income. 
In turn, Barça earned with his victory in the European Super Cup in August 2.5 million. 
However, the variable payments, for the 337.8 million. 
This money is proportional to the value of each individual television market. 
The Spanish belongs to the first and has 4 seats allocated. 
The championship last year gets 40% of the grant, 30% of the second, 20% of the Drittplatzierte and 10% for the fourth place. 
The other part is, depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition, distributed.
