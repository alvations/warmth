A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat voter fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre sees it as a myth, affirming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Indeed, the Republican lawyers have been identified by 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult for the registration process or to vote.
This phenomenon has gained momentum after the elections in November 2010 which saw add 675 new Republican officials in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce periods for advance voting, erased the right to register as voters on election day and withdraw to citizens with a criminal record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state requires voters to present a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first state to ask such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
If empressèrent republican authorities to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to show photo identification card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards as the map of health insurance.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, lack of photo identification issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than 100 dollars to obtain the ID required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have the required ID card with a photo.
Much more.
Students, voters considered more Democrats voting for candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo identification card issued by their institution.
However, these same States allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters for the Democratic Party.
Moreover, Republican lawmakers have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
Moreover, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns have contributed to record approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 dropped 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period to vote by mail.
For example, in the general election of 2008 in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while they accounted for 13% of voters in the state.
The same was true with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11 percent of voters, but 24 percent of people who voted by mail.
In contrast, whites who were 76% of voters accounted for 46% of the electorate voting by mail.
Of course legislators Democrats and their supporters objected strongly to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors democrats.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the laws the more controversial.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo identification card.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Critics Democrats denounced the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions affect negatively the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which cause unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups witnesses, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one, found a difference of mortality among patients who were screened and those who had not.
The study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40 percent more likely to have an extension if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend that the test from 50 years ago, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
African-American males are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once they have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers, and others who are indolents.
We really need to impress the patient's level of risk of his cancer, by offering options, not necessarily by treating prostate cancers that do not harm life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who it detects cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will suggest to make the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, it accurately determines the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend that when even pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether it should go or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing illness
Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk to suffer.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved sufficiently could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If nobody smoked, the rate would rise to at least 50 per cent", says André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By contrast, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many remain also totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
That night to the health of the people.
"Just today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", says the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promotes the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer", ajoute-t-on.
Food
The agency also recommended limiting consumption of red meat.
Too much, it raised the risk of colorectal cancer.
Also Who, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by burned, drying or salaison can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"In the past can damage the cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer", explique-t-on.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, are not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them was a decrease the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with his doctor.
"Spending a screening test, it does not give cancer".
The Higgs boson shelled
The announcement of the discovery of the Higgs boson likely created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
They believed that the Higgs boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of anything in the universe, no less.
And then there is the latest particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "least worst" explanation of nature and the behaviour of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and she is very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major conference of physics, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly clear.
Suppose, all the same, whether it is the Higgs, because the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law inevitably unavoidable that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to get hurt.
But even if particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that she, too, such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "rule out" roughly at some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists rank the particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens appointed shutting, who wisely adhere to the principle of Pauli.
And in another move bosons, a dirty Gaza anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means they may well find themselves in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then split into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, incidentally) The Particle Adventure, of Berkeley Laboratories: the mésons, that we shall not here, and the "particles strength", by which the major forces of nature is spreading and that the Higgs boson would somehow related.
These bosons-là, it must be noted here, are not all of the bugs as exotic as it might seem.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a Higgs boson extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light" who is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerating or changes direction, this "disturb" the electromagnetic field in that particular spot, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
This "inconvenience" was born an electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared and ultraviolet rays, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
More stable field
The same goes with the Higgs boson, except for the fact that this is a different field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" that the Higgs boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, we have to reach a very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose only a very large rock could wrinkled the surface.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles, or all the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the magnets, do, but others not - a piece of paper, for example, will never himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles that interact with the scope of Higgs: those who do have a mass, while others (such as the photon, want) do not.
Now, what does "can bring" all these research, asked Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any gap between the observations and predictions of the MOH.
They are also several earnestly hoped that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and fill some holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for the seriousness (oops!) or the dark matter, which makes up about 80 percent of the matter in the universe (re-oups!).
But there was no such gaps at CERN until now.
Impact
The implications of this research in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Take: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in the Bell Laboratories, do not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They see scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, has already told us the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsés) in 1962 - initially lasers were seen as a "gimmick of lab".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from any instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during its work in perspective.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intent, now serves "eye" to all digital cameras of the world, and it won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Commission die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly while a bill is preparing.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried to for a closer look.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer who rongeait left him with a break of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years ago", he said, wry mi-raisin, lying in his bed at home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, as housekeeper, where he arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease is his masterpiece: a huge weakness that prevents go only to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Aware before a sexy lunch, he agrees to get help to eat, resigned.
Brave, they sometimes smile, talk to strangers who gathered around him, give him his medication, offer a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that I am cure diarrhea, it is humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man, standing problem", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Back at the stage of the Child, for some people, is a humiliation unacceptable.
"It depends on the person's ability" to accept the decline, he says.
Because, according to several people involved in palliative care, great moments are at the heart of this downturn.
Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer from cancer.
They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them sufferer so-called curative care ".
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is dying "conscious and stifled".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children", she said.
"I have lost my wishes in life", she says, before accepting that he poses a mask to help him breathe.
She still expected in the coming days, a last visit to his son come to Italy.
To Victor-Gadbois, it cares, with a group of volunteers, care of the body and assistance to food.
These are the palliative care, given when there is nothing else to do.
To make their lives more comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 residents.
It is very little when we know that we end up all dead.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions ", says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the house.
That the physical comfort, emotional or spiritual.
The dying, it will provide care to mouth the brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, it served beer to Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son, who completed the beer to the feet of the deceased.
"It helps the families as well as patients", says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
Home Victor-Gadbois, the days are too ".
Alongside an old man of 93 years who is relishing his final assembly of family in the courtyard, propped up on pillows while it is taking the rap in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and their two young children, after having tried everything possible to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois arrived from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, at the hospital or nursing home.
And several agencies, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home of Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer.
It is precisely this great gap in health care that worried many physicians specializing in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, travels to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before it agrees to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency in great pain, and they do what is necessary for the relief.
I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are struggling on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The hopes of survival of Helene Richard were already minimal when she abandoned a gruelling chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I would have to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stop to beat me ", she said.
However, she told me that I was over!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of patients seeking to die thank the caregivers of not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that palliative care are not absolutely empowered in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Society of palliative care at home in Quebec, patients would be unwilling to treatment for pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, who returns to lull the patient until the time of his death, sporadically, or permanently.
We cannot pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you euthanasiiez me", it means "I want to be relieved".
This story was made possible by a grant of journalism of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Major property scandals in Quebec
Officials of roads, construction contractors, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a great "system", a mixture of construction industry, government officials, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" which was very expensive to taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system crumbles since that we took the major ways", "Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
It is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through investigation on the substance of wrongdoing related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, made only begrudgingly.
The report was "on a direct link between industry, covert funding of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he says, the only Department of Transportation could have saved $1 billion on contracts", some réfrénant their instincts to collect co-payments!
The Commission Charbonneau "has already brought down two mayors", he says, hoping that it gets to "demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals".
An anti-corruption permanent unit, established in 2011
The anti-corruption permanent Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More officers of the "Marteau Squad", which, since 2009, led the sewer "cartel" of Montreal to soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, it has conducted searches in series and laid charges of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a town in the suburbs.
The next on the list would be Gilles'll, who resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of having pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally charged by the engineers to roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
He caused a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining government contracts.
Himself has paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia reversait money in Union Montreal mayor Gerald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito has sown in all directions in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals.
He said also have organized a fund-raising illegal ex-vice-premier liberal Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts which it soared costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-ingénieur in public works, detailed well before the commission: in 10 years, he has received gifts of construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribes totaling $736 million, in exchange for contracts which it soared sewer costs.
Other officials confessed to being grease the leg by pumping up 30% to 40% bills, by false extras.
Then a party organizer of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately ignored a budget parallel fueling its boxes with dirty money.
Following the revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies district, east of the island, it complains in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers in the real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation that eventually will be put in place, she says she "pull one thread to understanding the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pinpoint the culprits".
The process, she says, is "painful but positive".
It is in the process of cleaning the wound, but there should be an investigative unit own in Montreal and a day before, not to see the dubious practices.
As they cleaned.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but worried particularly the role of "elected during the ploy", when they do not soaking in the Tammany!
Believing at 70% share of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec, he ":" They told me that this was only a pale reflection of reality ".
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties but it will not change the equation, adding: "As long as it is not strictly limit campaign spending, there will be dirty money in politics".
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and financing of political parties: "You can't go and get to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this?
This can be explained by individual conscience but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Major players arrived.
Every day, I was on their side.
The technical staff also told me.
On a daily basis, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in the match, it is easier.
Everything is going very quickly in football.
But I didn't fire.
My debut at the centre of the INF préformation Clairefontaine during my visit, I always advanced by levels.
So you pull competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits this summer are used to compete in games to a very high standard.
They also know that every training is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to confront and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect among all the technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He played great players.
I think it will win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I was coming out of a series of injuries.
The trust that he gives me also explains my performance.
What is your view on the first part of the season.
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the finals with the Paris fashion.
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good teams in Europe.
First, we want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to receive at the 8th finals return.
PSG can become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG to have the means to make this happen.
In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we were really at heart of pocketing the championship title.
Last season, it has not gone away.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
It has been a very big season.
It finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has made a season even more fantastic.
This year, I think it is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think he has the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media waiting too PSG?
It is only natural that we should expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
You would completely.
Later, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
You can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not FC Barcelona!
It is trying to implement a draft game.
A team is built over time.
It has been proven in the Champions League that you could meet present.
Look at Manchester City, who are not, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the final in Paris, they also enormous costs!
Given the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points ahead in the truce!
It was neglect our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, had been "boostés" by this new PSG.
It shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can hear the smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, it eventually prevail.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better that it says that there is a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very efficient and that he puts a lot of goals.
It is time for that and he proves that he is the star of the League 1.
He has shown everywhere he went that he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group are complying with the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
It is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.
How did you lived Euro 2012 with the team of France?
As a disappointment.
I want to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury stopped me to garner the game time.
I have seen things there and I am stronger.
Today, I can achieve good games in selection.
This is what I was hoping for my baptism with the Azzurri.
We learnt lessons from what happened in Ukraine and now needs to have an exemplary behaviour.
What is your view of the first months of Didier Deschamps led the Azzurri?
He has the results for him.
It is well positioned in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the wins.
Like Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White had reached her goal in qualifying for Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Azzurri in Brazil.
The good none (1-1) snatched on 16 October, Spain is a match founder?
This match has given us confidence.
Each fought for everyone.
Before this clash in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of the current currency transactions, based on central banks, identified and transaction processing fee among stakeholders.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, banking monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros) and a memorandum of exchange secured in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer file-sharing.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
A thousand of Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after peaking at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (courses are registered on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
She described bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the more successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin stands out other types of virtual currency as the "credits", used to make progress in a video game win by playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time a central authority and control trafficking trade.
With Bitcoin, all the knots of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users is in reality between two e-mail addresses in the manner of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose an address different for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of dual encryption key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged do exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The étape-clé is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line.
It is a phase of hachage to file, i.e. conversion of a big file in a digital fingerprint shorter and unique.
Computers "are" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" the whole.
The goal is to find the number who gives a unique footprint (lots of zeros early).
Once this number found, other knots check easily that this is the right approach.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very fast (less than ten minutes), one of two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisibles until 100 millionth, which leaves room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also rising in each increase of the computing power.
The life of the network has already been ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and the bitcoins stolen in deposits.
"The loophole used is not the protocol itself", said Pierre Noizat, which has just launched paymium, a company payments in real currency Bitcoin using the network.
The ECB also outlined the potential money laundering through this anonymous.
But the cash also has this defect.
Actors weight as Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins not run.
In November, "giants" balances have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of a book on this educational currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses to validate Bitcoin transactions, which costs less.
The porter manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement among merchants, who have no need to install new terminals or software.
They can communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", said Pierre Noizat, who also claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement challenging hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point", prédit-il.
The ECB, in his report, plans to reassess the risks various, today considered high, in case of success of the currency.
We went to Afghanistan.
And after?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any wait for us.
It is mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, injured, maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign military presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadis, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local insurgents, they would be more when Westerners will be more discreet.
The departure of French troops of the Nijrab base, that I've seen from the top of hills planted almond trees thanks to funding from French, is in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored joined Kabul without being attacked, examined by helicopters.
There will be no tidal wave of Taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their advance irresistible from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country as a result of fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban converge in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They reversed in wheeler-dealers, seizing of government land for resale in building lots to refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American outsourcing contracts.
They face; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I've heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who seized the American largesse: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They have worked alongside the modern world during their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65 percent of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as boys.
It will provide work to these young people who will not return to the dark days of the old parties or corruption of some leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas with a modern world is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities who will command be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is already to rebuild provincial militias, which will be irrelevant to the central government.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the powerful local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralization, the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state, strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country is, since the 1950s and already well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been called into map, no dam is in a state, no important irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control on infrastructure was needed.
The noise was widespread that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to treat iron ore and copper on the spot, or means of transportation for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the My Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the vast Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will be a day that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French fighting troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French Department at university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "win hearts and minds and achieve the impossible task of match aid and offensive actions, a service" civil-military actions "of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), deleted in 2012, led, and carry out by a small French NGO, many public works and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
The work, known to local workforce, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, trees, protection of soil and increase cultivable land.
That do we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of local, very tough in these valleys located often at more than 2,000 metres.
The embassy has received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in Kapisa Province.
For release of the insurgency waged by foreign groups, what farmers told me to want, it should keep in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled and affects them directly.
Forcing through a constitution in Egypt
This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which temporarily granted full powers, he decided to play its protagonists.
Took everybody by surprise, it announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly approves the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two months to this House to finish its work.
Nearly two years ago that Egypt is based on a first draft, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
For his opponents, President pushes ahead with his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "trampling on the right".
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a means to an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that requires the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, the Egyptians.
For President, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic, while the dispute raged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi appears convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
As the use of a vote precipitated's ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I retain full powers", supposedly they should end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, most Islamist, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were still missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing it had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, members replacements, have been added to the anxious, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is usually unanimously that the items were voted.
Analysts are also amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day has spoken around... prayer times, some members of the committee, claiming that the pendulum of the evil constituent was resolved.
The text, which was still being voted last night, includes 234 articles.
Objects of attention, Article 2 remains finally identical to that of the 1971 constitution, stating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "the principles" by the "rules", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a sign of goodwill and respect of other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisie", say the liberals, who see it as a communication.
Because, according to them, the Islamisation of the Constitution is conducted through other items.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly with regard to verify compliance laws with sharia law.
According to the expert in Egypt Sophie Pommier, that is worrying because "people called has decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy ".
The fears of the Liberals are also being inflamed by the fact that the next rector of the university should be much less moderate than the current.
"For the moment, there is no religious involvement.
With this constitution, it remains within the framework of the civilian government.
Most lawyers who worked on the text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system "restricts Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "there may be an ambiguity around Article 220, because the words borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" including Islamic jurisprudence [,].
And the question in the future could be asked to what extent of civilian judges are competent to decide upon ".
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers it attaches to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but at a National Defence Council.
Nor will be banned the trials of civilians in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, they deem anti-freedom.
The blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of speech, the press in particular.
No article is no longer echo to the protection of women ", said Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president to speak last night on television, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will take them, Saturday.

"Who language has, to Moscow": migrants are saving money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, the selling of "false" certificates have mushroomed in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their purpose: to earn money to help their families at home.
Since 1 December legislation came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule is that those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, with time, promises the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
He'll have to validate his language skills in Russian to obtain and renew his work permit.
Are exempt only the citizens of the countries where the Russian official language status.
Those who received certificates or education degrees before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of test centres will be under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the Peoples' Friendship University, the State University of Moscow, St. Petersburg State University and other institutions of higher education in Russia.
Immigrants can take examinations in cities across the country: more than 160 centers have already been open throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce exams has been supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law takes effect, human rights defenders have already repeatedly raised the issue in the press: why bother?
What is the obligation to know Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First, meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering "of slavery in work".
Many speak defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a selection system organized will resolve to 90 per cent of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certify Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of help him will provide a "journey" in an overcrowded cottage where he and dozens of its tourmenteront similar for months without food and without paper and will work between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We have received many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, you take their passports, and they do not affect the salary anticipated", confirms the head of the Directorate of migration services to the work of the migration service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't disputez me, sir the officer!
However, many nationals of Central Asian republics who wish to come and make money in Russia said they are not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This of course is not their fault, but their woes: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow if only a primary education fair.
Indeed, their families have not even to feed their children without talking about the dress properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people make money when the opportunity arises.
It is difficult when you don't know the language, confient-ils.
"You sense declined and stunted".
The defenders of human rights notice, however, one important aspect of the law on the language.
The reviews are intended solely for migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no review or official working thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defence enter"
Many immigrants say it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? the administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
Moreover, legalizing costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have forged documents, that we have no registration, hence the extortion cases.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea", confided to reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Dream quickly, without skimping and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of reviews of languages have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The papers forged out of a common colour printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: each migrant who hoped to be facilitating the task of exams spent seven thousand rubles to the document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights advocates agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption to ensure that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities can give the migrant workers who have not been able to validate the test for the first time to language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not involved in arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against carrying civilian arms.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether firing performed at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which left seven dead.
The police wants to ban the carrying of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age to obtain permits from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons would be introduced in the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "turns the screws".
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, require to abandon this hardening "foolish".
The percentage of crimes committed with a gun registered is minimal, told the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and expert on crime for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police while 1,168 1,000 crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws governing the civilian arms will not deter criminals to buy on the black market.
According to them, you can find in Moscow today any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior says he controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: the factory to the officer
The black market weapons are provided through multiple channels.
The main channels are five, says Viktor Baranets, retired colonel who served 10 years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking orders from weapons
The first is "track military", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by Caucasians", said Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals.
Baranets explains that it is both looted weapons in stocks of the police as those stolen directly to representatives of the security forces.
The illegal guns go on sale since the military stores.
Many of these children are often suffered explosions.
"Previous versions appearing indicate that some of these fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit", says the former military.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers are for something.
"You see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow", says one expert.
One of the other sources of black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and submachine guns comes from poor countries, such as Kirgizstan.
"You can find a local production, sometimes improvised a mafia was formed and organizes supply", says the former military.
Where are the weapons?
Experts have estimated the approximate every source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was formed in 2011 by the Center analysis of problems and studying for public administration.
Experts have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal cases and the public data relating to weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, say the researchers, comes from the army and law enforcement officials.
Half of weapons on the black market is found "by the lack of employees whose work is linked to weapons", explique-t-on in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "surreptitious searches".
A seller and consultant had requested an armoury of anonymity ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by these specialists of the illegal search; they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers will seek new goods in warehouses military.
The person buys through a teaches a unit, for example a pistol TT.
The book him in passing the goods by a fence.
"It carries in the city and resold to 900 euros a unity with two chargers", he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all business, so when crimes are on the verge of being solved, she makes a purchase of control to merchants of illegal weapons", says the seller.
"As in a boutique luxury"
The seller and the buyer are generally through knowledge.
I consulted websites, blogs, until a type occurs and suggests I come to the station to Begovaya where someone would get me into a "corner" to haggle.
The price of the gun, I was given on the spot
Viktor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I know someone who has a touch, says the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust it.
There are sellers in the markets, but there he must come as saying "To the part of this person, who asked me to convey that her daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I buy even a pair of American fists with somebody who I trust.
I am the book only to me because he knows that I do not give.
The new kids seek weapons of different ways.
Former Viktor Baranets military has tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "anything you want".
"I thought in a boutique luxury", remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, said Baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, I am not just to buy, it goes with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
"It leaves me shoot and when I am convinced that the gun works well, it begins to negotiate", describes the expert.
A shop since his sofa
Search engines have sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For that, it does not require any document and person.
"It only takes a specific amount of money", écrit-on in advertising on the site "Buying a pistol or a submachine gun to combat".
Users are asked and asked their questions.
And sold to minors?
"Without a permit, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Achète TT. Moscow", wrote "Fedorenkov" in his request very direct.
The Federal Security Service issued a vast network of fake sites with shovels and picks up those wishing to buy weapons to fight.
People are jumping into the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia
Viktor Baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of this type of patterns: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment to the automatic.
"It gets in return a photo and instructions indicating where is hiding the weapon", says the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, they can find themselves without a weapon and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service issued a vast network of fake sites with shovels and picks up those wishing to buy weapons to fight.
"People are jumping into the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia", he says.
A $24 percent
The purchase of a firearm illegal, the experts say, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a gun for 100-300 24 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
He exited warehouses by the long-term direction of these warehouses of average size.
According to official data from the ministry, compared with the period janvier-octobre 2011, the number of these crimes has generally declined in Russia 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while the confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs dropped by 7.8 per cent.
United States: employees of fast food and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers spend by working as a cashier at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against the low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or diminish rapidly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Alongside the increase modest wages earned by employees of Walmart and home base in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations seeking the establishment of trade unions.
This sector at present is not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a freak rain balances seizing million befell America and triggering sometimes esclandres.
That day, some employees of society Walmart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people, have left their posts to organize picketing with unions and the left-wing activists in stores the company whose products are intended for consumers and middle class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles through the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many poorly paid workers at Walmart shop solely on their workplace.
The price and the choice of Walmart's products were one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products including because of low wages of its employees.
They also complain the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants demonstrations of "black Friday" demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of health insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For the employee base among Walmart affecting 9.5 dollars an hour, it is a sum that it cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California Berkeley show that if Walmart increased the average salary at $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more of what it spends.
If Walmart went any higher wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store their would be tantamount to 46 cents more.
They spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests took place in just nine states and has borne no harm to the group.
The "black Friday" continued in stores from 8 a.m. the night at midnight the following day and Walmart has sold over this period 5,000 articles in the second.
Its funds have done in all 100 million transactions for the "black Friday".
The company spokesperson Dan limitation said in an interview with the left-wing site Huffington Post that "less than five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a "Operation com 'among many others" on the part of the union organizer.
"Following involved!"
The protests were held this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this city, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they don't even make you sick leave and don't pay the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage set by federal law and New York is $7.25 an hour.
The fast food restaurants have increased over time, but not by much, on average its employees in New York are $29 an hour.
Nobody is getting less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time where almost a quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself to interview employees of McDonald's who complain of having to live with the wage and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. near the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue on the cashiers and cooks the restaurant are paid at least $15 an hour, an increase of more than twice the minimum wage.
They also appealed to set up trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration obstruct and punish the protesters of a union by bullying or layoffs.
However, the administration their simplifies rarely life.
For a union, grab the fast-food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary staff turnover.
They disagree
Other demonstrations were tumultuous several other fast-food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering around midday near the McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several policies local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announced sell billion servings and after they don't even make you sick leave and don't pay the work you've done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by other New York Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we must all support employees fast food so that they get a fair pay and economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized the event as the largest ever of the fast-food industry throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated without counting that not all were employees of alchemy, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is still difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.
"For the moment, nothing happens only mildly to fool the brain"
Lately, fans of new technologies are used to collect augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it is Google, which unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it emerged from the meeting with the director of the interactive 3D technology group Microsoft's lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists in this society, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands through the creation of virtual spaces open.
- Could we say in a few words what your research group?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole remained at the moment the pixels on flat screen and sometimes the tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox it sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
- What we also reserve the future?
- While the Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things are going on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems operating on different technologies, including the projection technology.
We need to break the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
For that, however, we need to identify not only the user, but also the space around it.
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.
And start, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice?
It is appreciated, but is it not overstated?
You can't say that this is the panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we didn't always want to inform the other of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order the machines in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not broad gestures, but rather to subtle gestures restricted.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: gesture + voice.
- It is to say?
- For example, how am demanderiez-vous you miss this brew?
You would with words and deeds.
- But I speak only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
- So, you want to force users to adjust depending on what the machine may or may not do at one point?
- No mandatory, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work for the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of the man.
This may include laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and that is very important.
- If you are interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you don't like in the modern cameras?
They lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely on our work on the recognition 3D.
It would be nice to get about 8 playlists with a speed of 1,000 c / sec.
But the problem is not the playlists themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to the last point, all current technologies are good enough, it added jobs for designers of algorithms.
We must bear in mind the resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
The speed is also much, the number of executives in the second.
Human movement are aggressive enough, and the 30 c / o don't really enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave to the touch sensors a regular delay treatment between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I'd need a device of its kind in my work, but no longer requiring touch, to have more cadres in the second.
- But don't increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third is in fact a camera sensor field the usual visible.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse by increasing the amount required of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, playing with the curve and cameras to see how it could help define the locations.
- Much as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses to the public.
Don't you think that a view of the daily use of augmented reality technology, the glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walk all the time with a smartphone hands is not practice, but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transitional" augmented reality allow you to leave a cloud platform to move glasses in the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal and that makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality glasses to leave you will not work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
He proposes - a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographiques objects in the air is more accessible than Tony Stark in "Iron Man but also to mere mortal.
There is a problem on that critics are pointing the finger at this idea: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers your group making compared to this challenge?
- In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of touch sensations.
For the moment, one of interesting is the use of the second hand for support of image.
It captures perfectly the pressure!
But there are also technologies that are really designed to attribute the palpabilité to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound beams directed at a specific point the finger and that gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, a breeze on the ends of the fingers.
There is also the wristbands worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of fingers, they are also an axis of work with prospects.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels it should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a task today on which it will take longer still have difficulty: how to pretend to someone who is physically in a very small space that it works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, nothing happens only mildly to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in a state of absolute fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" has the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to city dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This list ultra-sélective has hosted prominent players in the arts of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the painter outgoing Metropolitan Kirill Miller.
The whole city is Metropolitan Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all dressed in red that can cross near the Russian Museum, Garden of summer or the holidays and vernissages connected.
The paintings of Metropolitan Kirill Miller together always crowds, regardless of their place of exposure.
It is one of the storytellers pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths.
Metropolitan Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a symbol of the city, his appearance made people smile and puts them in a good mood.
It has recently taken in his hands a organ grinders who were playing and it became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since it was ripe for this difficult role in its existence, philosophy, and with his image.
 - Metropolitan Kirill, why do you hit the streets in red and yellow or blue turquoise for example?
 I have chosen the red as designer specializing in the look and the image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray raises the aggressiveness and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
 - And when did you realize that you had to be a painter?
 - At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevskiy the whereabouts of my work.
I realised that this was my way.
Then, the wave of unofficial painters from old and new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I started to become friends with the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there has been no wave.
I am interested in drama, fashion, music, all genres except the words.
 - And it all ended up in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took seated Pouchkinskaya-10 housed before the work a club music and arts, with a club, the home of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: the NOM Tequila-Jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The Van Gogh's ear".
Chnour and his friends sang songs easy in own voice in T-shirts moulants, they included Igor Vdovin, composer today fashionable.
When the group began performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Anti-war Trakhtenberg not bad for emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We have given them Trakhtenberg and then his great career began, but his training and his basic education, it is here that he has received.
"D137 galérie", Club "Griboïedov": these are the repercussions of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees are parties as accustomed.
I am a hero of the past century, the time when the culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: that was the price "The leaders of our city".
I was appointed "Peintre of the year", and it was then that my reign ended.
This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
 - Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
 - Many of my paintings are hits, they possess a valid and a very strong vision.
I'm having an exhibition scheduled "The Russian museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a category timeless.
Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it's scary to be so.
But with the clowns, just disappears, the tragic tomb.
I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.
For example, the idea of saving the world via the garb total and compulsory.
Today, it is the dress that matters, it is interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside the person.
Maybe you can't give him the hand, but that it should instead be him spit the Laid To Rest.
And the lies will be erased by the garb.
 You - Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A city cultural must have this kind of hero.
Who else that I can play it.
 - But perhaps commercial art can also be beautiful?
 - Today commercial art should be treated, delicate, sweet wine.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the twisted another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it's hard to please everyone.
I am not a ticket of $100 to please everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you please.
Each star has 100 fans.
 - But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhaïlov!
 - These are people that we have laid who came to see him, it is the social and sexual side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately it is less management, money, just waning.
I have my fans, the essential thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the lived.
When I was young, I peignais paintings that a collector has hung beside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings, which usually are those that are painted in end of life.
Today, often confused ideas.
We say: there is the impostor, the culture of consumption.
Consumption is not culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
 - Metropolitan Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
 - Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of good Tsars, it wasn't like that, the Tsars might misunderstand culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because it takes higher experts who will assess correctly these experts and their fraieront a path.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste", displayed.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, there are artists who must find other museums.
 - For you, what is St. Petersburg?
 - St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is far more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there is a lot of curious to see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project with the support of the St. Petersburg
Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or asteroid collision murderer.
Caravans of shuttles with earthlings aboard go in search of a planet.
To save humanity, a large question arises: how to continue to provide our species in weightlessness or on a planet of rescue?
I believe that there is not much choice.
There are two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis.
"It's Venus and Mars", said Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomical Institute of State P.K., Chternberg (GAICh).
If conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500.
You can live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in outer space.
It has begun to address the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
There is still a century, it was conducting experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit is in no way différenciaient varieties explains.
Then it was put into orbit insects, small flies drosophiles breeders.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness.
You get out a poussin quite normal.
It is then that the problems start.
"The problem is that the poussin must find a medium, it must get on its feet and start moving", says the director of the laboratory of the problems médico-biologiques Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding no support, the chicks were splashing in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns were entirely atrophying instincts.
The chicks do not respond to light and sound.
Unfortunately, they died just after quattre days.
"We his eyes widened twice, then we abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev in determining the failure of the experience with the chicks in space.
The last "miniature ark" organic with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" embarquera that species of the same sex.
There has been an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, it has not found anything supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and this is the only experience. we must do this kind of research", said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the rats of the space has given birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly into space.
This is no small feat.
By losing their natural environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, the man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses the abstract, he was able to create a proper emotional.
This type of experience is not made for ethical reasons.
But women are in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity has more valuable.
Our seagull flew and person on Earth could not say if it held after flying in space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody answering this question", said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, sector pensioner rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, was also cosmonaut Andrian Nikolaïev.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after being twice on orbit and has even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and giving birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during the flight into orbit", says the pilot and astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity has to seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre for preparation of cosmonauts: compulsory stage of the preparation for the flight.
Here in flottabilité null, cosmonauts train monitoring space walks out.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but however a foreign environment, for infants is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby is changing around nine months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb, it is easier to get used to the water.
This is, in principle, logical, because since its birth until his first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"It is very little to forget", says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, women need gravitational force weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles in the abdomen, the pelvis well very quickly, the ability to surge of baby is lost.
OK, do not know it based on simulators childbirth.
Of course you can prepare a baby in a special chamber, the woman arrives at the break.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If he does not feel the pull of Earth, the agency does not form the skeleton nor the muscle system.
You can't pay an infant as an adult with a special suit for training.
It will simply be deprived of his livelihood.
"And this experience we would envisage in this case imagining the birth of a child in an alien environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté", predicts the Director of the committee on bioethics issues médico-biologiques Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in outer space is still theory.
However, over time it will become a reality, when can visit their shuttle buses to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Supreme Audit Institution) said: "control of the so-called independent work (in Czech" system Švarc ") has failed because of the politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and legislation of quality but it is lagging behind in terms of its implementation.
This is what said Miloslav Kala, the deputy head of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking among us", said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A control conducted jointly by the Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar findings.
He cited as an example of abusive practice the approach of the "system" by Petr Nečas Švarc.
Premier said recently that the ODS would not upset the entrepreneurs with testing; so is allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to go inspect to demand respect for the law", said Kala.
At the meeting of the review committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in which have been likened the laws in public procurement of these two countries.
What was the question?
It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years.
In simple terms, the EU legislation provides for how to manage the public markets and specific national laws as well as a practice proper him follow.
We gathered all this and although the vetting process is not yet complete, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "tougher and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to develop continuously rules increasingly detailed but that it was necessary to devote themselves to the implementation of the law.
What this project can help you in practice and in equilibrium situation for you?
A joint control of this type should contribute to what we get to try to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when this was not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting it at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by the paperwork that those who seek loopholes will find much more opportunities than if the threshold remained above.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different style?
In terms of institutions, similarly to the ISC, works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a board formed a bit differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similarly.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: Germany being a federal structure, it has also in the past accounts of this kind at the level of individual states.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the accounts of Länder.
In terms of national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I would not make comparison without any concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but you can certainly not say that it is better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I don't have data for comparison.
However, it is also true that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a range of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, no?
In terms of national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on the public markets, its effects are already being felt?
This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our operations of control.
As we do checks in retrospect, it takes with a lag.
Our observations include only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls, we launched a new tool to detect risks "mismanagement" with which we have scrutinised almost 14,000 public markets - where these changes will come naturally feel, because the thresholds were modified, as well as certain types of procedures for tendering and so on.
So what do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will prove that.
The problem that can happen is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (for example the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) forcing control subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe this way?
No, not in this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse, but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Look where we will not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that DOS would not upset the entrepreneurs with checks on so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
The system Švarc prohibited or is it?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to inspect and move to demand respect for the law.
He can say: "We will change the law and authorize it", but he cannot say that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities to accomplish and what, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder will be removed only for cause of faults.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snow-covered.
The network is still largely practical, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were this morning passable, but also in places frozen and snow-covered.
Temperatures dipped and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 C but they should increase slightly in the day.
Snowfall in the region and it is in the plains that a thin layer of snow.
The tops of the Monts metal-bearing (Krušné hory) are, however, covered about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the regional service road maintenance because of the fog, visibility was reduced by places.
The fast track A6 and national roads in the region are now passable without difficulties.
Vigilance remains at setting, for example on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All county roads and paths of third category, including the mountain roads were passable.
There is still on some of their portions of remains of snow and frost in places pressed down by traffic.
Especially in areas at high altitudes, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.

The Directorate of roads and highways reported on its website that some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow, which fell by trafficking may find themselves on the roads in mountainous areas and located in altitude.
Road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the region of Pardubice located in altitude.
Freezing rain can occur in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto mostly on county roads and third category.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow lies mainly in the Monts of the Giants (Krkonoše) and the Monts Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow pressed down by trafficking is present on the roads in areas at high altitudes.
Eastern Bohemia, the time will be dry today, most often reached, with potential passages cloudy.
It will be a weak wind and temperatures should generally between -3 degrees and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the region of Pilsen are now passable, although, in some places, it should be more vigilant and adjust to the weather.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 degrees and -9 ° C.
After the recent snowfall and chill that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility improves however gradually.
This is evidence of the regional service road maintenance.
The highway D5 is workable almost without difficulties, the maintenance of the road, however, recommend a vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The coating of most highways is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and Tachov district.
Departmental channels and third category are moist and in this case applies the warning against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, and particularly on the roads less busy in the region of the Šumava.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling in areas of the Olomouc region located in altitude must now count with deep snow and soft on the roads.
This layer remained on Col said "Červenohorské Sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced this night maintenance staff roads to travel on the ground; according to the services in charge of roads, he fell more than three inches in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are passable without difficulties.
"On the heights of the District of Šumperk are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník should expect to meet at the Col said "Červenohorské Sedlo" deep snow and soft "said today in ČTK the road maintenance Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the district Jeseník also went on the spot during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment, roads, are now available and time, even in areas of the highest level.
In the district Olomouc roads are passable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in sections in forested areas to roads remained wet.
Regions borough of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
This morning, the roads of North Bohemia reported several sections difficult.
The data of the police, in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitude, and therefore the snow and freezing rain should stay on the roads. in the plains, especially in the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem, and roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement was reported at the time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal nighttime training: rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
There are also reports, since the main roads, difficult conditions on national highway 13 on the border between the regions borough of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to the trees that are bowed under the weight of snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "In the concert, we want to collect positive energy".
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month that should be the end of the world?
Only one of these new alarming, the kind of traps in which we love fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, rather laugh and say that we are the only group capable of collecting a rest of positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you get in December a project completely unique: three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you present in more detail this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we prepare for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December 10 to 11 hours of the morning.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will conclude practically the moment will end the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati which lies in the Pacific Ocean, one time zone ahead of 12 hours compared to us.
Whose idea was it?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to together, with the public, reflect on the state of the world we leave to our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a unique collection of artifacts, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys on the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world is entitled "Ending world cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, the entendra-t-on also during these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has no place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymns will join also at one point in the context of a live show, completely unique, Czech Television.
The lyrics to the song were written by Tomáš Hanák that also takes the lead role of Jesus in the clip Xindl X sings also...
How are you come to cooperate with them?
We are working with other leading figures in the Czech show-biz, owing to the fact that we have many concerts and charity events...
We are trying to involve them intensively on these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and fun.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo accessible to people with reduced mobility and we are working to achieve in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly with the students at the institute and offer them Jedličkův activities that interest and the fun.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička, we transférerons this project in a new building independent.
Several groups of music and performers climb on stage during each of these concerts?
According to what criteria do you have the chosen?
We tried to develop a program that is available to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, climb on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Get ready to other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; again, surely we will prepare a quality program with guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United States, I'd like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so here you played by example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you handle the organization and logistics of your touring?
It's not so terrible that it looks at first.
We have five members in the electric chair whose devices must travel in the hold, naturally we trimbalons also lots of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything is more or less always well past ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your trips abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of ease of access for the disabled, the attitude of the public towards the disabled and so on.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other locations where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow to the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet known, a person moves only in electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not see even as evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately there, too, an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
In what can still catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things for which we are still behind...
It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are still dependent on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, the museum anywhere...
It is not very common there that many people with disabilities are actively involved in social life on this point you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary to the forefront of progress!
The public's respect and accessibility are one thing, but the situation really start to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years, what motivated you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as a teacher at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am musician (I plays the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created an activity music.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughter).
The success only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, creating links with singers and work actively to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if he did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union subsidies, we can also afford to have professors of quality, equipment, and so on.
Have you designed to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of tips that mimic each other.
In a way, it's logical: everything new is agreed with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not sick, abandoned by all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a full life and thrive, if the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for them but for all of society.
Does your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are described by many people?
If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a certain discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for the concerts, they are rapidly losing their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are a group opened, people come and go, you can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would want to join us.
It will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will be in the arena Incheba in Prague, Brno and Ostrava in to Fléda Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
Late at night, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when will jointly sung the song from the band The Tap Tap "Ending world cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to collect funds (25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo which lies in Prague in the institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, advance ticket sales of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's meeting of ministers from countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became full-fledged member on November 12, 2008).
Poland had begun a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years has participated in a number of projects of the agency.
The map of Poland into space, much sooner.
Even before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on spaceflight; they could not meet always understanding.
I would like for example the conference of A. Šternfeld to the astronomical observatory in Warsaw on December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde book entitled "Introduction to the Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld was reminded that only Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to the Astronautics".
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagateur astronomy and Astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in newspapers Polish and wrote many books this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagateur of Astronautics world-class, his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925 was built in Poland a hand car designed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
There is neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was meant to propel or curb the hand car.
The only information known about this hand car are those of the press.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets.
The research was conducted by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with faculty and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
According to documents held that this research had reached the stage of testing.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has stalled.
In 1937, plans a hunting photoélectrique rocket, designed by the engineer Rohoziński emerged in the press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - Torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had to use a military rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects to use of the technique rockets were led by the scientific committee interim advisory ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated all the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish company, Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautics (Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is talk of a society in November 1954 Issue newspaper, in which stand four more detailed articles devoted to aviation.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Mr. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to the Astronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research was the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, society Polish Astronautics (PTA) made efforts to enter the international federation Astronautics (established in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA in became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-chairman of the Federation International Astronautics.
He retained his post until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA each made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a range of 1,800 metres had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the rocket two-story RM-2 were begun in the desert of Bledov.
The rocket was a 1.4 metres long and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
Following the prototype should have been able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work were halted.
The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period 1962, 1965, succeeding the first rocket type RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were dominated by the scale of the space for scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liter, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types of device was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aviation institute, the first test flight of botanical garden in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently were built and Meteor-3 Meteor-2H versions.
It is worth mentioning the entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
Under the programme Interkosmos, Poland also participated in space exploration on the artificial Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviétique cosmonaut program.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court has repealed the law on the work of public utility.
This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion.
No doubt it is interesting to examine the issues from a wider perspective.
The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic unregulated competition.
This means that the various economic entities as well as the national economic systems are always in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of free trade and the free circulation (unlimited) of private capital ally to financial speculation.
The differences in the cost of labour (wages) generate pressure on prices.
It should be put under this term meaning: a producer tries by the import of goods sold cheap to resist economic competition in "making it more expensive" the price of competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and to increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad or buy at low prices, or disappear. the result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no responsibility from a social point of view and thus responsibility toward the unemployment, the social costs of the state increase necessarily.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race to profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in individual economies create a situation in which the governments of various countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the standard of their own people in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This occurs primarily in the amendments of existing laws.
The goal is to force economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and the restriction of the rights of employees in the area of labour laws.
The result is a growing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are points for years of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already by million the number of these people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such salaries that the state was forced to pay a premium to reach the bare minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as helpers in the federal parliament.
The cost-saving measures of virtually all Member States southern EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or to languish with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.
Now we have to ask the question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will rise from one country to another; this capital may not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian national or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
That includes all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get bored with it, that the state cannot make equity investments in its own economy, that the command economy led to an economic disaster.
The private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
Then you can ask if private capital does not influence and, even, is not running today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the state as a whole.
The answer is definitely yes.
The proof is that there is a powerful lobby and present in almost all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, for the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, domestic departments lending the drafting of legislation to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as saying the Western-style constitutions, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now rapidly facing the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the Roman Empire to the time of Caesar and Pompée": "The rule had long been in complete decline and functions were attributed by violence.
The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
Kickbacks and corruption collapsed without limits and people went to the election with votes already sold ""... The honest people did not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State was 8 months without consuls "... 'We really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that he had to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the society is based on the profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to represent the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence elites, without any effort to conduct in-depth reforms.
Therefore we have to seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in unscrupulous liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, we can see the disappearance of such systems in favor of liberal democracies such as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites totally ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human losses, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today as well as crimes against humanity as we know them by history and recent.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally and domestically, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to explore ways to reduce the level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is to be subject to political reforms, which will enhance capital investments of the state in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government, and will weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the State.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever of violence and never will", says Sting in the song, whose main Fragile towards the refrain is "let us not forget how we are fragile".
"If my son did not want wars, there wouldn't be", said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high.
Some are taking the side of Israel, claiming the right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in his recurrent waves of killing; after all, the current residents of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the start of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a view, located behind the curtain ", to which benefit mainly tensions that persist already for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small piece of countries in the Middle East.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals who were acting independently or whether they should their actions to the throne to someone who ran their actions based on previously defined goals.
We have to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration causing some financial powers did not happen in a single generation.
Among families with an astronomical wealth is particularly noted the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they have acquired the first World news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to establish links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major stakes in most of the world's central banks and preparing or conducting wars against the countries in which they have not yet of such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq five after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America of the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (governmental, I hear) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to send money home and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed to have triggered the Great Depression.
Their thirst of global power has led in the years 1859 in 1871 in formulating a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason introduced to the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war aimed to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to remove colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient to their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme was nothing other than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, to acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then suggest a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF intended to prevent a repetition of such crises as they arrived in 1907).
Having managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Czarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of czarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of central Europe.
Easier for an outbreak of the second world war, bankers have left politicians create a situation of simmering conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany to sky-high war reparations and the conditions of radicalization of impoverished masses (they can then make a strong enough leader, pointing the finger of blame, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who should play the role (she actually) was fifth column to ignite and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for a mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war began; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had held initially; or if everything he did was planned, the fact remains that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that repairs war imposed on Germany were the origin of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has sparked a conflagration that could spark a third world war.
If international bankers can trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the Arab population or mostly Muslim Middle East.
Israel is like a big laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but at international level (just see how people bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrongly in a circle of violence and where there are at the root of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?
We must make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers did not propose to people in the elections that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, who are keen to start a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) expanded to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which passes 20% of all the world's oil (naval corridor has a width that 2 miles) and lead to the destruction of the global economy.
In what light now appears the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree a new world order".
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new born at birth is implanted a microchip making him a fully controlled.
"What they require all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slave to focus on hand or the front a brand, so that he could neither buy nor sell anyone who is not the name of this wild beast or the figure of his name.
You have to understand: that made sense in the figures of this wild beast.
This refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six ".
The film Argo: when everything is worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators made up of Islamist students took over the US embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for decades.
The situation didn't offer to the US administration of positive outcome, she couldn't abandon the Shah, because it has seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, blow compounded later by the fiasco of the attempt to rescue hostages by force.
Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate in the United States prompted a wave of solidarity and a sense anti-Iran government from emerging.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the face of Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections of 1980.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, escaped six employees of the embassy.
After a few detours complicated, they met in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through an implausible coverage: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a crew doing the repérages for shooting a film epic of fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan of the exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requit collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magasines did rule of this film project, press conferences were held and a production company was fictitious real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film, Affleck is an unusual combination of different genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed realistic but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy "Ocean's seen, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres are unfolding: footage of Tehran to documentary style (in the sequences are presented iconiques captioned photographs of the days of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been retranscrites in the film, there is no great difference)
Lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career so remarkable.
Actor ridiculed, he became a respected director and his acting has ceased to be ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first movie to Affleck who is not taking place in his home city of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that would put his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also is showing that sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is required" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets during the reconstruction of actual facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given location, wrote a page of history.
Affleck and his staff get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the wrong camera crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many shares at too many places
The director had to settle for a subject which was in fact little thrilling scenes, the film sense of the term.
He fared well, he sometimes add some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a telephone call in America and the continued on the runway are quite far-fetched).
The weakness of Argo lies in his character dissipated, due to the need to show too many things to too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are delightful in their role as Hollywood cooperators, their characters have deserved greater attention and they are far from alone.
The film of Affleck lack a bit of tension, he allows himself to do with moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It leads to the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet somehow incomplete to date, and as illustration of the character exaggeration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotents and omniscient, he made the case.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into banking fees the most absurd, decided now to launch the competition of the settlement and ideas from "the workshop EU" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU plan, recently, adopt a quota of 40 percent of women on the boards of large European companies was at the root of our decision", said to the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far however, women were favoured in terms of insurance rates on life because they represent, objectively, a lesser risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any idea unbelievable "the workshop of the EU".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, which has adverse implications for the environment, or the ban on using the reliable to mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against a ban on use of the phrase "butter spreads" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas of quality must have a size 14 centimetres.
The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a state or a group of states (and the Czech Republic now dominates the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto).
The interests of lobbyists are also, for example, responsible for the fact that in the EU, bananas should not be of a size smaller than 14 cm or submit an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has defended by arguing that she did that harmonize national standards not homogeneous who made the trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables were relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that the existing guidelines waste food.
The first prize will be awarded in this investigation to the resolution of the EU last year that should be on the inflatable balloons a warning stating that children under 8 years should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a US inquiry that balls are among the toys, the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 years for what is blowing in trumpets.
At home, too bizarre ideas.
The rule on European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia", and must instead refer to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let's Roll" liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in the investigation, in addition to certain absurdity mentioned above, the resolution of the Union on the volume of reserves of food on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set higher volumes for the reserves of food products that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic exceeded then, for example, the volume set for risqua canned mushrooms and a heavy fine.
The organizers of the survey found merit in the idea of pay sums of money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of a grant to apply for the subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that you have no sea handicaps.
We will ask the European Union a refund ". so said, in the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state got full stocks he had then export.
According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic was far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech Republic, and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access by sea.
Subsidies for obtaining grants have been proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should actually be used to write applications for grants awarded by Brussels.
The EU says: "the bizarre regulations are rare".
If the regulations are often criticised by the member states, according to many experts, efforts by the EU in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by the member states during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other EU countries, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it cannot fight not always winner) raises profound emotions for the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", to which the name "Tuzemský rum" dating back home in the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "Tuzemák".
Only the alcohol products of cane sugar, not sugar beet, can carry the name of rum.
In the official list of products made in the EU are today with internationally renowned as the mostly cheese or Gorgonzola, the massepain of Lübeck or of Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), carps of Pohořelice and in Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and hops of Žatec ("Žatecký Chmel").
Bread of spice of Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets of Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want I saved the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, expresses senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how was it the idea to stand in presidential elections?
This is not to be a senator or president who account for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I wouldn candidate nowhere.
But I cannot cope with how the country is looted since the last 20 years that thieves are not behind bars and taxes and the retirement age rise.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I'm not, so I try to find a solution for change.
And as I have more than 40 years and that I am independent, a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation to stand in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You took in the Senate but you quickly en route to the Chateau (We: chair).
Do you don't turn your back on who you have elected?
I have always said that I am in the battle for the Chateau depending on the results of the senatorial elections
Afterwards, I said that if I was elected senator, I would in presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is merely a tool allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the influence the largest and broadest mandate.
The problem is not just that as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of our television, but it is also that we piétinons cough those trying to make the change.
Added to this is the press who breaks the reputations and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It was, for example, I said to my misreporting journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Moving to your visions.
You started the fight for the castle with as hobbyhorse themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond 20 million CZK [of].
To that end, you have to change the law.
As President, you don't have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I pressed for the activities of tourist guide is a profession liberal, successfully.
The problem is the politicking: when someone comes from the left or right with a good draft, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As independent, a member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, take each party that is best for our country and its implementation.
You see, rather like a man left or right?
A Czech point of view, I feel that people put me rather left.
For me, that this is a little to the left or right, it is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
For me, it is not that people are left or right but to bring people together ".
I am always any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party, or ODS and I am equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enragez when someone calls you a populist?
But what you said do not prouve-t-il?
When choosing a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal purpose and vision.
You try to bring you.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals that I talk were implemented by the world and leading experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you can still slogans.
You don't survivrez long in politics with it.
Do you think that if you're going to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to win them over to my camp to impose it.
If I am elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, government officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they do not want to.
When there is a strong personality who can identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, unequivocally, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and my visions.
I launch into politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try, alone, to make things, and if it doesn't, I'll quit in six years and I will return to the private sector.
It is as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't tell the difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run in the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud to fuel oil.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of people did not vote and what did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independent.
People have elected a Senate that will be difficult to impose changes.
Despite everything, I lutterai for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects regions.
Do you plan to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have the time to check if the past of each potential member is without blemish and then I don't have the financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
You don't have money?
You talk about tax returns, what's yours?
I think about 60 million worth of my personal property.
I in Prague a ground worth $25 million, an apartment worth $10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth $1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of kid: I have always loved James Bond, travelling by car, and you've got to dress up with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive your Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a $60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
I should into debt?
I have already invested $2 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation that I receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live on, for instance, pay the English school my son costing 30 thousand per month.
If my sole objective was to make money, I will submit to any election.
So you will continue your business to live?
Don't you said you mettriez your activities muted?
But this is not linked to the amount of the compensation.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take in the spring of the leadership of the travel agency.
People would like I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
However, it should be while I deep something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my commercial activities.
You will find this interview in Saturday's edition of the journal Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only imagination. we need only watch Spijkenisse mountain of books and the newly built - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see", said Lisette Verhaig, a busy on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer in a large company neighbour, we said: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need today to a library.
Everyone has Internet, an iPad and Oklahoma.
Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of those libraries ringardes, no?
Spijkenisse, a ville-dortoir which has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The town of 80,000 souls has the lowest level of education of the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and replicate the seven fictional bridges on tickets euros in the form of cute little miniatures of reinforced concrete painted.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get their hands on the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the Rotterdam architectural firm, MVRDV, master of diagrams sticks bold and creator of buildings witty and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and won the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on his face.
And while the board members were still, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brash, empila his books of choice in order of size into a pyramid, and ended his speech buttressed arguments by activists: "expensive town!"
Here is my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung up from land.
The building is part of a revitalization project also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project has been shortlisted for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
The small town dull, which until now had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian zone and a mayor of a postmodern ugliness bewildering, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy plant, has been fueled by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural edifice in its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell to cheese.
Admittedly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you foulez the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The Interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the soil in the Netherlands and the elegant brick lamp-posts unequivocally speak the language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
There is already the gaze of public benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball.
And everywhere books, books and even books.
"Normally, the library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a room large and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal", says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classic Space configuration and open spaces in reading from the inside looking out.
Inside the mountain of books has been skillfully fashioned: amid the offices, the library Internet, the chess club, the Centre for Environment and the technique of building.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes paneling, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes ramps of stairs.
A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of hardened building materials are not unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", said Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
One day we found in a farm frisonne an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
The Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane of a millimetre thick as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and we win over time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then you can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was compressée, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis four inches thick.
Under the effect of the heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) change colour and transforms into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose smell evokes both a new car and shoes.
On top of the 105 stairs is the top of the mountain.
After nearly 500 metres, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, but also Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but mostly they contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity in the air of the mountain literary.
Donations for the soul new
"It is unbelievable, but despite all surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is resolved by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a bell glass, the sun lights that little time inside, even the days of good weather.
The thick timber beams mounted wrong compared to the facade of glass used pare-soleil, intercepting a large part of the shelves.
The prevailing atmosphere is very nice.
The blinds completely automated can do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the septic computer programmer, has already risky to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even the Boekenberg describes as the "soul" of Spijkenisse finally found.
A few weeks ago indeed, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book based on his personal library.
This has led to fill the voids of the library, which was not yet fully loaded (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are overflowing from all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a half-empty library".
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is just for decoration ".
Thus, MVRDV reached discipline mistress that is referred to in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and poorly educated.
Finally, a new starting point for the birth of a new identity.
Szabo: "Germans should play a bigger role".
Germany chose to abstain in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: earlier this week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany did not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin should exercise caution, because it has a special relationship with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support either the US position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but not to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO attacked this measure.
Germany éprouve-t-elle difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy virtually defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are therefore on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they still are experimenting to find this role, but are on the path of a foreign policy "more normal".
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
That means so concretely the term of foreign policy "normal" for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions beyond those of the United States and European partners, including the national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relationship with some regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are somewhat different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced Germany's stance on the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention at the United Nations vote?
Germany has first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin should take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites of Arab countries.
It is undoubtedly a key element.
However, I do not accorderais too much importance, because it is not exclusively relationship unilateral.
But it is certainly an important element in the German strategic thinking.
Germany nuit-elle to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the gap is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps that Germany will be respected.
Indeed, Germany demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
By contrast, the United States announced its veto of a clear voice.
The opinions diffèrent-elles between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of the domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly a great understanding toward the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot of course not defend his position publicly.
I think the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm about the policies of Netanyahu.
Germany éprouve-t-elle struggling to reconcile its close relationship with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners?
I think it is not helpful for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
They may not register within a broader political line and must assert their unique position.
That is what they are currently in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will continue to play a leading role and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel.
This has always been sensitive.
But to me, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence.
Germany into play a role of weight on the international stage, Germany, want only assume a key role?
Or she always struggle to assume leading roles?
Germany is still unaccustomed, it was always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties to play a bigger role.
If you look, for example, the euro crisis, we note that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many antiallemands sentiments are heard.
It does not help matters for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded hostile countries.
This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.
It must deal with neighbours and opinions varied, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy only diminished, but at the moment, the EU is not filling the vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if you don't like them, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated is life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts in Europe and North America to analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, in US foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are trademarks known around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind the name is a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand has a certain protection as the company bears the name cannot complain.
And even if it could, there is no assurance that it would succeed.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrived on my desk.
The imitators did need some additional letters to register their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, recorded Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, recorded Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the maker of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a file cabinet in the recordings with the trademark office of Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in siphoning off part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of the copy and the violation of intellectual property.
In major cities, the malls on several floors that virtually that sell counterfeit goods.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituencies the responsibility to address the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office formally gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", is relative.
The term is derived from "Bang dakuan".
It is with this term that are designated women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say he had nothing to hide.
"It is bad for business, we must fight against this trend", requires Pattloch.
"The brand is paltry, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs are estimated to be in the millions for sectors, especially regarding key products expensive.
According to the market analysis firm CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third global market for luxury goods and fastest growing faster.
However, it is not easy to write off the dubious recordings of the register trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported cases in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "reality of the marketplace".
Pattloch explained to us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money in plagiaire, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.
In this area, sometimes it is the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the maker of construction machinery Sany, the same company that had bought the producer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, the acquisiteur Volvo, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. the conflict was settled and Geely had to amend it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires Hong Kong and Singapore who had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The trademark office ctmo in Beijing admitted, however, have faced some challenges in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the IPO would be spent last year of an "emergency situation in the conduct of the work to a newfound normality".
The number of procedures untreated opposition has dropped 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain pending in the office.
Expensive act
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for filing marks, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record and this means that China is for the 10th consecutive time at the top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world.
It would also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, every recording reported on average 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle is costing far more, as illustrated by the case of the German family-owned Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of components of vehicles will be suspended.
However, the imitateur was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the brand Freudenberg.
"It is our fault because names cannot be protected in Germany", said Hanno Wentzler, president of the leadership of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office had rejected the objection of Feld-herrnhalle.
Freudenberg has certainly been successful with the following two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is
Today, the case is pending at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and extols the professionalism of judges.
However, he added: "the procedure is long, hard and cost us a lot of time and money".
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. the service archives has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what you see what this means for us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over to Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region assured the exploitation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a production company in footwear and leather.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is required".
Pattloch and advises German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international law, foreigners should instead "record in China everything which is likely to be protected", said Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be much more important than those of the recording.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay a license fee to the other side for the use of its own name, as explained Wentzler.
Or we will lose our place on the segment of the market.
World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeats Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans of Swaziland welcome their arrival.
This is the story of a link that is much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you pat the foot: the cowboy boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and moccasins for men seek the pace by hitting the ground underfoot. very quickly, they are.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers are growing slowly - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they go overboard, mesmerised and unfold.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years, lost almost his canvas shoes when he conducted the orchestra with its actions of a wild flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the music room of the 12 hours of labor Médicale Institute in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years came, the généticienne in human medicine to the man at home.
"OM' Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir member has different words, all in a language very exotic: the Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help themselves
UNAIDS, the United Nations program to combat AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide have the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros for less, you can become godfather.
This guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the centre gogo.
Imbongi Zulu means "raconteur" or even "singer of praise".
Nobody can speak fluent in the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeat songs in the foreign language that she has brought in Germany to now make it to his native region: southern Africa.
Because at 8,733 kilometres of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland is eSitjeni the village, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of sufferers
The village has about 2,000 residents, some of whom live in modest straw huts or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphaned, because HIV took their parents.
To eSitjeni, one can see smaller scale the ills plaguing Swaziland: HIV infection rates, the highest and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population accepts almost never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction proved the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the HIV virus, and it is not uncommon to die in the middle 30s.
During a group trip in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had discovered the village. the imbongis have seen many children in the street it not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
In the beginning, it was just some people who pledged personally to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But barely a year later, the choir based "Voices for Africa", an association that has since then almost professional of AIDS orphans in eSitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STI, syphilis, and gonorrhea patients chlamydiées (or gonorrhea).
The STIs common are HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The pubis lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STD.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea patients often appear among men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are at the root of at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
Among adults straight, infections linked to chlamydiées, the trichomonase, the candidose fungal (), the gonorrhoea and human papillomavirus are sexually transmitted diseases common.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. however, some 20 percent of new HIV infections are occurring within the group.
Among young people, there is a rate of infections linked to chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to surveys in Europe, three quarters of all infections are young people aged 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not required to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in the past 10 years: the figure rose to 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases.
In 2011, there have been about massive case.
This represents a decline of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a disease sexual?
Infectious diseases can cause abscess in the genitals, urinary tract pain, white losses, pain in the lower abdomen as well as the emergence of buttons and warts.
However, they do not have regularly no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubrifiante or close physical contact.
The experts recommend to anyone frequent changes of sexual partners to conduct regular reviews.
Most of STIs diagnosed quickly can be cured of late and the consequences can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially to funds that are reaping the repertoire with their votes through Germany as a whole, the means accumulates.
"In all, we have already sent nearly 200,000 euros to eSitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, with one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos, thus so-called old women in Zulu are the pillars of the village.
Some of them are up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that they get up every day on time at school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no person is hosted in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, like the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 starving children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has established a school of fashion and allowed the construction of two barns. with the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association has organized an HIV test for many people.
This is not a matter of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"The AIDS is a real taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it is an issue which affects sexuality".
It is curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 wives official.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
These social mores sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also planted the virus across the country.
There is however condoms on every street corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.
Culture is different, flesh on flesh ".
Somewhat to promote cultural exchange, the repertoire of Imbongi go together in trip every two or three years in southern Africa and entonnent songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people on the edge of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white people who sing in African language is a sign of recognition as it creates not only a good mood and joy, but sometimes also rips a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus takes them always to eSitjeni where the repertoire visit their filleuls.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, eSitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to eSitjeni, you'll find the light", say the people there.
And after a trip to 8,733 kilometres, back in Heidelberg, before these singers who pat the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice could reach 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains water ice, one three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The probe Messenger reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the world permanently mired in the shade.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 meters.
Water probably comes from comets or asteroids, which may have hit Mercury.
However, there is no link between the discovery of water and the assumption of a presence of life on the planet, says the chief scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essentials to life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Notice of the world's inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to land, such small interstices through which there is forever.
The image comes from a camera developed by scientists in Germany of the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail of a photograph taken by the Spitzer infrared telescope shows a "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the "babies" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, called "W5", a name few romantic, in the constellation Cassiopeia, to 6,500 light-years away.
The Spitzer telescope NASA has photographed the flamboyant brilliance of a star dying.
The circle in the form of a grand is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies.
In the vast nebula Trifide, 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope has photographed the delivery room Plane.
The Pleiades, star cluster also called the "Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope is more colors in value.
In this photo scrapbook, the nebula Hélice, as a red eye, looking directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of bottle.
Its similarities with a continent on earth earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo reveals a dramatic hue.
Only the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its glory.
One of the biggest riddles of astronomy is the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings were the remains of a moon of Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion years without trace.
One of the photographs the larger and sharper that has taken the Hubble Space Telescope is the galaxy of Tourbillon.
According to the tint, photographs of galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousands of light-years away.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, split into three), because three dragged dust divide the gleaming heart the birthplace of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pileup in the constellation of Serpentaire: to 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two galaxies in merger rush one to the other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Space Telescope has seen the birth of these stars in the galaxy spiral M83.
If you don't like the abbreviations techniques, you can use his nickname "wheel of Southern fire".
The photo from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the nebula Iris, in the constellation King Cepheus "daughter.
The nebula is at 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are 10 to 100 times smaller than the current domestic dust.
This photo was developed from photos taken by various optical and X-ray telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes which lies 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the greatest "GC 1810 spiral galaxy".
In this nebula is the group of young brightest stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle heavenly still gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is that gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galilee utilisât a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors optical telescopes have not stopped growing thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope on Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma in the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa was Action segmented to make savings.
The diameter reached just about 11 metres.
The downside of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set in the vertical angle.
The peculiarity to his great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes to mirror of the world.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of space aliens signals using the Arecibo radio telescope of (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or" search for alien intelligence ") involving the computing power of his machine.
View on the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate the infrared spectrum means.
The construction of a huge telescope European (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its primary mirror should reach impressive size 42 meters. it will consist of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope can take photos before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the biggest in the world.
They wore two mirror with a diameter of 10 metres each.
Keck telescopes are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration can admire it.
However, the images of space the most important we come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since the April 24, 1990, we book images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The Hubble Space James-Webb (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane 5.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be tasked to find the light from the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists think the South Pole Mercury is also home to the ice.
However, no reliable data exists on this theory, because Messenger orbit much closer to the North Pole to Mercury.
Radar data indicated for decades ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to circling around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Daily drink butter, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people are ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which it is still relatively young to 97 years.
The trip in the mountains Talysh is a romantic échevelé.
The sort of many turning points of the road, the small bus cahote along forested hills, torrential rivers and farms modest.
Everything is green and fertile, you could almost imagine yourself in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the remote south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh, about which little is known, if only they are fluent in Persian and the Azeri and they have a very great longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne too aggressive with its architecture of the Soviet era that is not at all with the picturesque mountain scenery.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 miles, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist site.
"Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year, there will be here the festival of the oldest in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the lives of approximately eight tens of Talysh region with more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows a black and white image.
Here are my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Still have a child to 136 years
But the star of the controversial museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years.
There is however no birth certificate.
And when you think the oldest documented person had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems an unlikely.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973", says Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and he would have been 23 children. at the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would have misled few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard of the great age of Central Asia.
"People older surprisingly also live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "in Sardinia, too, there are men who are incredibly old".
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no record of marital status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is in fact that people in the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, about 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for longevity in the southern part of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
By contrast, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, think it is a question of diet.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that meals rich in calories of Talysh, who like meat, bread and mainly dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple lifestyle that preserves the young people? to Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor beside a baratte, it beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two small children gambadent also in the house.
In the kitchen, we prepare tea to guests served in glasses armadus in typical form of stomach.
The white teeth Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide long braids of a dark blonde reveals that his son with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and this is how I have not lost and they have kept their colour.
"I've never used shampoo", adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She has always ate what comes from his own firm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us of her husband, who was in the military.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has improved when the "beloved" father Heydar Aliyev took the lead.
The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, grows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded to him afterwards.
Nevertheless, the elderly of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And maybe the son of long grisonnant Mirzayeva is right: "seniors enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, treated and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" failed in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not a man of few words so full of emotion.
We must succeed the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was aimed at the entire people, and especially the Christian Coptic Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because all members of the opposition fear desperately confused and divided.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, have temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its responsibilities "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world didn't really know what to save this engineer 61 years, received a doctorate degree from the American University of Southern California.
The judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written in haste by the constituent assembly muslim 100 people during a nighttime tour de force of 15 hours are indeed worrisome to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the bill proposes that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But that really means the word "principles"?
It was and still is always a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the room for manoeuvre resulting legal to implement a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case is that suggests an article stipulating that newly introduced, regarding all issues relating to the Sharia, the university Al-Azhar ulema must be consulted. the facility is the Islamic institution, the country's largest and its lustre radiates throughout the Islamic world.
It can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislature, which would lead to the de facto guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation
Another issue is the maintenance of the military court.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts if employèrent suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, reads the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote morality and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the state could even control the content of filmmaking art and literature.
Clearly, it is simply censorship.
Moreover, no article does not expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits to offend or to defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
By contrast, the article does not define what is offensive or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of President or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are open to interpretation in the project that Morsi will submit to the vote and who, in his own words, will "very soon" the subject of a referendum among Egyptians.
"The renait revolution"
The opposition mobilizes for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to unseat sharia law before it takes effect.
"The revolution is resurgent, and we're going to win", Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to stage a "coup against democracy".
"If it affirms the referendum, we will go to his palace and the renversera", exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié", said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced not wanting to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its annulment.
"The Koran is our constitution"
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well-organized, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer service was held at the University of Cairo.
Veiled women and supporters of Salafist who participated in large numbers, chanted: "the people are asking for the implementation of the law of God".
"Nettoie our country!" demandaient-ils to Morsi, saying that "the Koran [their] Constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where it all began, would soon created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Clearly, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that opponents of the draft constitution, as his supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box in the direction of the country.
The project of Islamists win certainly the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process which should have imposed until February and include all social forces.
The lawyer of human rights of 48 years and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or in courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now, the end is not even mentioned once in the new constitution", he laments during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag "newspaper.
The extension of the powers of the three branches Morsi has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will spark a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president denied all its powers", says Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could afford.
A protester in the square Tharir warns: "You accouchez a monster that you will no longer be possible to control".
The rakfisk Norway: is this the most fragrant fish in the world?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy some of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite for a fish extremely fragrant?
Take cheese developed.
Taking in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty football.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and that smell, pervasive, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout saupoudrée salt and what in the water for a period - according to the smell that you want it collections Friend - which can be up to a year.
When darkness settled and it's cold, the Norwegians gathered en masse to attend a festival held here in Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary.
"You eat raw, then you avalez a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full-time also called "rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and slip a large quantity of beverage.
"Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk", says Havard.
The beverage kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid the move under your nose, it's not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi who reportedly spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in this water resistant to the air, then salty in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, fish is out and - no doubt with the direction undermined by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the top earners and a comprehensive health system.
Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, although fragrant, the past Norway.
This dish is more expensive.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost €10 each.
Norway does not often speak of it in the international news, which is not for her debuts.
Here, people are not willing to speak of Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist, racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they evoke this killing, they talk about "the incident on 22 July".
The Norwegians are unwilling to accept that in their peaceful country, one of their number had been able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the single reason for our success", says Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk by hand.
We are - how do you say - people prudent.
His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are quiet, we don't like to shine.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with caution - all, except for a small percentage of the proceeds of this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money down the drain, over the years that have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept the purse strings tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk", she adds with a laugh happy-go-lucky.
I am standing in the snow and I am queuing up to buy food - I had my share of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stayed is one of many places using the rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV where the presenter wearing his trademark bowties, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
You would think the Eurovision contest.
"What did you score the best fish in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"
"This is our points, Havard".
You hear laughter and applause.
A man falls to his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC looks at the challenges ahead and expectations of the people, of which there are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam security has been put in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from reaching their work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation.
A complicated task ahead.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results for the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before rubbing shoulders with the American president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A populous state and sprawling on the capital. on his land of choice, the new leader's views on this are divided.
A man direct
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all.
The local attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the commune.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was given to these roads, formerly bosselées and full of crevasses.
Displaying his name plates hang outside of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to establish lasting change", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we expect a real change that our country desperately needs.
After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected criticism from opponents who blame the new president of lacking charisma.
Indeed, it is very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
It's a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden beneath the autoponts highways, it is, in many respects, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also practical and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, we found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of murdered women over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has failed to stem the killings perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this neighborhood dilapidated Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back the tears when she shows me pictures of his daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believe she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed", says the Buendia disembarked.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigidity cadaverous was already underway.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dressing the wall beside a cross which contains the word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities have treated me as if I was an old commère, a fautrice disquiet, a pleurnicheuse.
They want to accept what they say and to cease.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope that it will be as good as president when he was governor", said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of mistreatment of Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during his detention.
The trial covers the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia, USA.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning is in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being behind the biggest leak of classified information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed many opportunities to complain about ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein said that recordings made weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defense presented a petition demanding that the Manning case be dropped on the grounds that the kidnapping was done in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then posted online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that officers had fulfilled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison at Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers have raised questions on Manning and entered his answers.
When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that gave him his guards had "excellent" and that the treatment he had been within the prison was generally "very professional".
The forms do no complaint of ill-treatment, although the officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not recorded the issues raised.
"They wrote" no problem " (after addressing the concerns), however, this does not mean that I had not raised problems", said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the special committee which had gathered to discuss the suicidal thoughts that he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Manning said his intention during the meeting was to alter his status restrictive indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said they had assigned the restrictive status -- a level below the surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff know that I was going well, and I wanted that I withdraw this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view", said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, USA, in July 2010.
He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and be gone once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that we have not been kept abreast of what was going to happen or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, this cage", said Manning, on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only things he had were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to keep moving, because sleep or lie down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he would come back at night, they so as to be able to see her face.
Manning's lawyer has filed a formal complaint to the treatment of Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked questions Manning on an allegation reported in her testimony Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked a whole night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time, he was only allowed to cover themselves with a blanket during the appeal.
During the questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said he knew from his custody order that he should drop its coverage that could not hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered him to unleash it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night, because he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could use the elastic of his underpants or with his flip-flops to harm themselves, but that it did not.
That night, Manning testified that her underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account of his experiences during his detention and that it will significantly reduce his sentence should he be found guilty at a court martial trial that should be held early next year.
The defense has said that Manning plans to plead guilty to the offences and fight for abandoning other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who will argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was jailed under the rules governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all charges are being held, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans difficult times, he said.
Navarrette said that the Mexico-américains are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two tracks: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Étrangers").
I stayed motionless for several seconds, leading to what I would do.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is an ethnic epithet, as my friends from Boston use when they say, "Irish", or my friends in New York when they say "Italian".
Then I became "mexico-américain".
But here it was Mexico.
And, on the land that has seen my grandfather, no need for special word or link.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can't lose my accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and I headed towards the queue "Étrangers".
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visit President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when leaders of the two countries meet, their themes include immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto had also wanted to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the US invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give written half their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, and no minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, once an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism against Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elite -- complaints about how Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And children Montezuma seek the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship the more difficult is that the country's relationship with the more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States.
You want broaching the subject of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestry in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a certain point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
Most often, this person matched a profile type -- a dark-skinned, uneducated man from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we now live the American dream, that we went to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live in, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn't like.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were individuals and not enough ethnic below Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be parties.
And we would be not stuck on the wrong side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who immigrated legally to the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between the Mexicans and the Mexico-Américains because Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Américains are upset.
Although American citizen, she has a sense of belonging to two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Américains I know don't have the sense of being part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los del Norte Tigers, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that we absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There are too many bitterness.
And, if one considers the wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they have treated Mexico a century and a half, they must accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can only ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that this was a vain hope.
While the same arguments persist futile to know which began, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by the regional upheaval.
Maybe their fight will continue to rise a little more.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help break the impasse fatal.
A war that is no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Even if the cease-fire granted on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that rules the Gaza since 2007, targueront have forced the Israelis to give up even if Gaza had been crushed.
Having killed some of its leaders and returned the 1.7 million residents of Gaza in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.
Turkey, a regional power booming, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic of Golf.
Hamas members jubilent and say that the Islamist is growing curve around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has ruled, through Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can topple Bashar Al-Assad and to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the central Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the dictator who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its demise in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
By contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important player who will not be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, hardliners of Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, including under Binyamin Netanyahu, the premier-ministre, which has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including the separation barrier that cuts into the West Bank, the main chunk of what could be a Palestinian state, and to protect Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegality in terms of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with a party even more combative, the leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the election on 22 January, has the most beautiful.
Why dorloter these fichus giving them a Palestinian state?
If they run the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and beat them as soon as they leave the head.
Maybe hardliners prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere enjoy little Israel, their first priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours combined.
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also look to the future.
With the rest of the Arab world who becomes more democratic, deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is bound to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression weakens already democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates the problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to stop Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
Both sides need to be driven by those outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
Hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give an opportunity to people outside of this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in the 1967 borders with exchange of ground and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs abroad should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute more to the establishment of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a pseudo state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has a vested interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not submitted its own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It is a vision very narrow.
Middle East stability is vital for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws of cigarette packs neutral came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs incorporated the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
The law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrific pictures of diseased organs and images of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking from their parents.
Outside of the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the strict regime in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco.
The Australian federal government has said that the aim was to deter young people from smoking by removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they never starting.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their image", said Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown by example that children pooled the crown of a logo with a princess ".
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would boost the black-market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"The consequences of this legislation", said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters China and Indonesia will sell well over counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others have said the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that demand for holsters to cigarettes, including silicone to conceal the horrific packaging, rose sharply two months since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the proportion of the population being targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, the sports sponsorship and the requirement for dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it can prevent foreign sites to do.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and you more than a small display to promote your products, the Internet is the place unavoidable par excellence", said after Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask if it is a simple citizen who loves the Marlboro cigarettes and that has bothered to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry focuses on the new regulations into effect rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new court decisions - these countries have reported to the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has been significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to interlocks photos of warning on the packaging in 2001.
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tighter laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to those photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package", said Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package that included a photo of cancer of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that will make me stop, this is my daughter.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult storage packages on the shelves.
"Before, I needed one hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours", said Yu.
"The government had to ban them once and for all, and we said OK, it's good, and you put the key in the door", he added, in their arms to the sky.
In a world constantly connected, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I had plenty of time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not going to lie.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract yourself (not to mention the duty free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in child development spoke highly of boredom.
It is perfectly normal to us - and our children - bored from time to time, they say.
It forces the brain to borrow roads interesting, even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we know more about the benefits of boredom.
So should we host boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will.
First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that is not the case ", says Peter Justice Toohey (Australia), Greco-Roman history professor at the University of Calgary, Canada, and the author of" Boredom: a Lively History " (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The problem goes back a long way", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there's the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After numerous publications and presented the idea in a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but had failed to engage in an activity satisfactory".
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he says, is that the person is not in the process of undertaking a task well as it would like.
With apathy, he says, there is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the problem, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, combined with a grumpy and feel that time passes slowly".
Boredom can greatly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be related, people who are bored tend to think the problem is the environment or the world, while people who are depressed believe that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, we often think that we're bored when in fact it is a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Caution", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience oldest in which participants listened to on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high of a TV who had no report, others have just heard the TV, and the third group has not all heard the pc.
Those who heard the TV to a low noise level said they had more annoyed that the other two groups - they have struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration to boredom.
When you're trying to concentrate on a difficult task or stakeholder, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
In contrast, when you perform a task boring, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bother you".
In fact, he says, now we know that when we are tortille or scrawls, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and get more information than those who are forced to stay without moving", said Professor Fenske.
We're bored one day or another - the delay of my plane ride, a listener with a voice lifeless, a film particularly annoying.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Nuclear Event Scale of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Among the tasks that I made, many of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so much interest that I do not have time to do everything".
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, including need stimulation many and varied.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent said they get bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom of today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew "adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level", partly because children and adolescents don't have much control over what they want to do.
If I based my question: boredom is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take risks physical absurd, make bets or abusing certain substances to pass the time, as studies have shown.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity ", said Professor Vodanovich, who studied the issue for more than two decades.
"The problem is the way that the brain has found to inform you that you should do something else", said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If bored and you use that energy to play the guitar and cooking, that make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give it an iPad, it gets lonely, but it will not have learned to handle alone or autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another", he says.
Your child learns only to entertain, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not think we should criticize him.
Feel comfortable outside the constant upheavals that generate the activities and technology is the goal for which we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to be bored more often, but boredom an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense", he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to get away and enjoy downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stops".
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student at a university and footballer in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon be legal in his state: the meatballs possession of marijuana and a pipe used to smoke.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were driving a car at Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco has received a subpoena for drug possession and material consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a scheduled court date.
"We are treated like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado for legalizing the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving a low use of drugs is more dependent on the place of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were closed.
Police departments have ceased to indict adults 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts of Colorado called for accelerating the affairs of existing marijuana and continue to charge people who possess them.
At the same time, several cities in the Denver suburbs to the mountains of West currently vote to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the state in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us", said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing him to produce, produce, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in terms of regulations on marijuana, firstly concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now with regard to personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator", said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, acknowledges Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base, he said.
The law of Washington, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a void for a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana is legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the rule which guarantees adequate access to marijuana accredited and banned the installation of shops selling cannabis in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a nursery.
"There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to install an Agreed trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle", said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the legalisation of cannabis Centre, a research group recently formed.
On November 21, the police chief, Oates, Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that "City attorney" (public prosecutor) would only pursue more people 21 years and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police must cease to charge people for this type of offence "with immediate effect".
The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and drug dealers.
To Weld County in northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision more strict.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users that they will be fully detox.
At present, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to pursue legal action against those who have committed a crime which, at the time, was an offence recognized", said Mr. Buck.
The reactions have been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for the limited use of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.
The public prosecutor in the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but has also decided not to drop a case all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, offer a proper governmental and legal framework for the personal use of marijuana is not easy.
And contradictory reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver who represents people accused of marijuana use and expressed as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws " (National Organization for the reform of laws on marijuana).
"They have spent much of their lives to prosecute people who consumed marijuana, also, they find it hard to accept that this is legal", he said.
As the first states to treat the limited use of marijuana at the same level of alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case of jurisprudence for legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials predict a new frontier of legalised sales, they expect with concern the federal government guidelines, which designs always sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite some high-profile arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the commercial sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
If it is true that the police aren't likely kicking down doors to seize small packets of drugs, it is likely that she opposes accredited businesses for sale of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado did not wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before the votes, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the creation of new businesses for sale of marijuana, even if it is only a year's delay.
Last week, the town of Montrose obtained a moratorium of six months, and is expected to impose the ban next week.
"We don't want to be in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we end up with a federal problem", said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against the amendment.
We're interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
Many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied and ruled out of Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not just today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother have studied in what was for me a prominent place to know, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university because I had objected to the fact that of undergraduates had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after being forced to drink in cups ébréchées.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been the victim of intimidation and been the subject of constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, or because of the fact that I came from a private school.
I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was an influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I talking about it today, I agree.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
Rising hatred and institutionalized Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the room students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were "often isolated, attacked personally and feel undesirable" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the committee of the university for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Wonderland: young, Intelligents and Right"), devoted to the policy among students, and the Tories "" being portrayed as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It discovered including the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", which uses a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver and moves with a cane to head chromée.
In other universities, students conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees ".
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that" there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met ".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of members of the JCR to the people who are center-right.
"It was an impediment to freedom of intellectual debate and the well-being of members", she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was 18 and a crippling shyness.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a title, because of reduced funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week, when new students met with others and teachers, I had a taste of what would happen afterwards.
I discovered that teachers not only attended the sarcasm to students Tory but they were having fun.
It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood classrooms.
The first sarcasm that I have been the victim was a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I wasn't prepared.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please bring the first paragraph"
I lost my footing.
Pitt, a small man in the face pustuleux, easily prevailed.
"Is the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burnt the eyes.
"I suggest you take French during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends", he launched a 127 tone.
I returned to my room, weeping inconsolably.
At the dinner that evening, I sat only then I felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
It was a student in second grade in English, appointed James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, gently.
I fear it.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeting.
It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, in the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything that had said Mrs Thatcher.
This ploy failed.
A first year student of philosophy, political science and economic, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are contaminated.
Other students have taken up the refrain.
I was distorted, dirty.
"How do the Tories love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, isn't it? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
Should I have become Labour and disown my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory ostracism and isolation.
The only Tory was openly professor Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because it was Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view of marxiste-déterministe history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here", he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and home to my parents in London, finding refuge with family and friends urban more open-minded.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was in disbelief.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world", he told me pathétiquement.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city to dreamers church steeples.
Even my friends Communists had ways blameless.
He was in tears.
Laisse-leur a chance.
I am sure this is to tease.
I break the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has steadily deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a meeting of work directed the following week, when another history teacher suggested most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do so.
Rougissant internally of shame, I recognised to be a victim of brainwashing of my parents and the traitai "old".
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the final nail in my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
Nestling I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned.
When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I have never returned.
You can treat me to wimp pleurnicharde.
But no one under 18 should not be a victim of such a bullying at school.
The tragedy is that it was Oxford, who not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys a solid reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefer elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other celebrity clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged at the opening of "Valentino: master of Couture", a retrospective prestigious which brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this", he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "signore" Garavani, who but that could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes memorabilia as trophies of his upward mobility: the designer of the small town of Voghera, in northern Italy, the toast of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with love royalty.
"At least they don't break their cigarette butts on your splendid carpet as do some pop stars", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we all lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a host spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We adorions all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad", says the ex-wife of "" Heini Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred to elegance to notoriety.
Even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, did not forget the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decor, the food, the music.
"With him, each guest was important and appreciated", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the week of the doubt anxious in Paris in 1995.
"He never will it be fashion, because his creations are works of art", she says.
Parade of noble lineage
The life of Garavani is not a story of love obsessions but shared.
He likes the people well behaved and with the biggest titles and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was transformed into a podium glamour 60 metres wide, which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of mannequins and must be marching on the podium to admire a "public" dream of bringing the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor that chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the public of models include names like Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Abascal Naty and designer in 2006
Many of her clients say that the first clothes Valentino are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat "Gillette" and a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It is a gift that he had done to me", said Naty Abascal, a muses of the designer.
"I prefer to all the other for her femininity, his great love of women, and because it sublime our beauty", adds the ex-duchesse of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and shed light on the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Patricia della Giovampaola modeuse d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she has been a model Valentino.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress with a skirt to flying a bustier draped and a Sandwich Islands to fall.
"It was a dream come true", said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless", says Italian aristocrat who divides his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg retains the designer's evening dresses with "great care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, she is also all the memories she vehicle".
The "king" of fashion
The final major exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage to Paul Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls its seamstresses) to achieve this dress in ivory silk with coloured beads, 12 kinds of different laces and a train of four and a half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the press, this dress is a historical fact of couture of the late 20th century, "the return of client high society".
For years by the nerd "savoir-être" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani has so many honours as any husband of her clients.
"His sophistication, his calm, he looks perfect cared for and I have always been evident", d'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him, it was a month at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was spotless, the years have no effect on him".
If this is a princess who says...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen human mules
For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health with 70 kilos of sulphur stone pathways across the top.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who work literally hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living in bringing the sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gases emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air.
Having reaped large rocks of sulfur, weighing a total of nearly 70 pounds, he moved in two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders trails across the top.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters, but the porters exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a pace of turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their not not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened in a French tourist who suffered a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur excerpt.
Once on top, it their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and wearing painfully heavy baskets, walked the three kilometres to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below to 1,850 metres.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, you might say, its employees, to whom she pays 662 rupees (Indonesian 5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
She then sells it to 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry because it is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whitewash the sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip", explains Anto, usually three trips a day.
All it took 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it may be a misery for such a superhuman effort is triple what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees ($1.20 euros) a day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros) ", said the porter who once worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also no doubt that the sulfur: "I married a girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I reduced to Java to that she should convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing constantly, and his eyes are angered by the toxic gas.
At age 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and door special gloves.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing constantly, and his eyes are angered by the toxic gas emitted by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work even two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" promet-t-il English in a more than acceptable.
Battered by life, this young friendly and intelligent could be guidebook, server or a receptionist at a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey.
He shares a hovel of substandard wood with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because of sulphur does not out at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow becomes shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the dark, Anto goes down into the crater in illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.
Despite its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters who are self-employed and are paid to the weight.
Moreover, they do not affect either a under 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the entry of 15,000 rupees ($1.20 euros), that the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not humans", protests Madrusin, a portly 42-year-old porter who works in Kawah Ijen for 30 years, since he left the college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that he will not stop working "as long as it can", because he needs money to raise her three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although the sulphur damaged throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turned and trap the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so tough that no one complains to suffer serious diseases... plus of course their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pain in his knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight baskets.
In balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, age 53, can only charge 50 kilograms.
Every day, his companions and extracting him 15 tons of sulfur in volcano that three trucks carry the Tamansari warehouse, 18 miles away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.
"I won't retire, I will die here because the volcano is my life", says Unainik opening of the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as porter of sulphur.
Time is running out, but poverty persist from generation to generation, one of the hardest jobs in the world: what are the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.
Singapore research babies to save the economy
Singaporeans cast the responsibility of this lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to the property.
"The people of Singapore should develop".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfilling our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that those words come from an advertisement for the mint, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap group which uses local references like "Come put an open secret in the drawer" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem of funny way through this publicity.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to "fulfill their national duty".
It is intended solely to the Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the birth rate, and we felt it was an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried several things as launch pheromone fragrances or hold speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative but they don't necessarily worked.
We are therefore said the following: what could be more creative in solving this problem than to do a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take this lightly.
He spends 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers is providing up to $15,000 per child, longer maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech cité-état Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he has been above 2, considered the renewal rate was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says that it is the "best education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the formation of a family", she says.
These changes of social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of unmarried and to delay marriage and the births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increase immigration to curb the population has created a resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that shares a barely disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese who are accused of shooting down wages and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year has experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to get the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale enjoyed great success.
However, the authorities were concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the property company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than the housing greatest.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more quickly than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give instructions clearer to developers, who was previously a spanner in the works if they wanted to offer too small in a housing project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a cité-État.
If these new regulations could be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, chatting with Singaporeans who work in the financial district in the centre, it would seem that they are not having much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that's why people give to later", says a young framework.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time", said another young 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of homeownership and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies are Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private is private offline online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or "the area of privacy that we can protect any intrusion".
That est-ce-qui is in the private domain for those under 16?
How to apply this definition in daily life and on social networks?
Understand the dangers it is exposed to broadcast on the Internet of events that he does not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associate the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "the password and username" when they have applied to social networks.
"I'm not my personal secrets in a post", says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secrets secret, my mother can know them but not everyone", he says.
On FB I'll post images nice or games.
I also discusses with my friends.
"I don't share any of my pictures or someone who would be a fool", he says.
The boy recognized that it was wrong to publish lewd photos of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 on FB friends as well as his nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority of the family.
His mother is a part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write of interesting ideas.
"I don't know if they say, I simply post", he says.
"The social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or friends, rapid way", he says.
He says he would never accept the demand for an unknown person.
He wouldn't trust someone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Jose, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits he does not know 20 of those on its list of friends.
"It does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example", he says.
According to the boy, nobody gave him advances or asked for her address or phone number.
"If they gave me pressure or required, I simply supprimerais of my account", he says.
José has subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name of cyber-stalking are not foreign to the boy.
The near one of my friends was deputy on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he says.
The victim, according to José, has not closed his account.
"He spent only in private profile".
We then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account of safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations or embarrassing.
Yes, I'd do if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know that this is the cyberstalking", he says.
Key issues
Marielos says, professor of English and dismissed in Education and Learning, considers that to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to seek information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game has changed", she said.
Says reports that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and digital immigrants", uses these words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and young people who are born with technology.
"We, we are digital immigrants who must then teach them, while we ourselves are learning", she says.
He added that the issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what is needed or not disclose, to publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so".
"We are also asking them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences", she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality for children and adolescents is to use issues that are sobering.
"Their to not do it serves no purpose", she says.
Then, says lists examples: there are things that you don't would tell a foreigner, why are you doing on the Internet?
Or, you like they publish a photo of you as a friend that you published?
Did you know what others publish on you?
When you identifies pictures of holidays, demandes-tu other people permission to identify them?
And also, everyone he need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on social networks", she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the conditions of use of social networks.
In each consisting of words, they will have a solid foundation for talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publishing", he says.
According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind the children not to talk to strangers.
The summit of the Unasur ended without the Declaration of Lima is made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended in Peru today without the Declaration of Lima has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 proxies present.
EFE has tried repeatedly to access the document signed during the sixth Oedipus Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the presidency reported initially that he would be released after the close of the summit, then said that it would be published at a moment's notice on the website of the Peruvian government.
When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists "access to information about the summit has consistently been limited.
During the day, only the video without the presidential meeting with the message, "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists were those of the officers of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents here, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media demanding information more important.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that has reached the summit.
In October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd summit of South American and Arab countries (takes) and, on this occasion, although this has been insisted by the press, he had not released the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the takes, we can verify that the document was published in March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems safe for all journalists, but they have the most limited obtaining information.
The summit has also signed a joint agreement with Chile and Peru to accept the judgment of the Court in The Hague, which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the lawsuit that Lima filed against Santiago and that begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect the verdict and exécuterons who solve disputes that we wear today in this international court", said President Humala, beside his Chilean counterpart.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law to the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals", added President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, beside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of two presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Stability Bogota by which it had agreed to abide by the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua she considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala has been asked to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The trustee has read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur would put in place of "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residency permits".
He was informed that shares would be put in place to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, equities for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in all of South America, and to assess together and effective the risks of natural disasters ".
With Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not have a matrix triomphaliste but should help increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our people", concluded the President Humala.
"We have decided to focus on a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection spaces for South America, particularly in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic system", said the Peruvian president in a speech.
Among these projects, he noted that five were Peru and were on the broad lines of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two targeted a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give any more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another topic at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss calmly of maritime dispute through the ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua who will ask to have a discussion with the country", he said.
"I hope to be able to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and environmentally friendly as possible", said President Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they planned to attend the take-over of the new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the context of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers gather prior to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which is trying to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru is the President Pro Tempore of the regional bloc.
"The South America must learn from Europe how to fit a citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal to which "South America, in this case, should take a leaf out of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Cairns Group, that Europeans "were killed during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"We must reach the free movement of citizens and workers in any Latin American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to do a thing of the past", he warned.
In addition, the president of Ecuador has shown for the restoration of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the pact in San Jose on human rights.
Those who we rebattent ears will never compromise, conversely, we, the South American countries, have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa said that he does not regret her decision, because he has himself betrayed its principles, but instead it met its "profound democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that, at the time, "there were suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected".
Moreover, it criticized the Swedish justice who demanded that he had misrepresented on its territory to interrogation for an alleged sexual offence while "own Swedish laws can do this by videoconference, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa said that there was a risk that the physical and mental health of Assange deteriorates.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, the ambassador told me that he had had a small lung problem, but nothing serious", said the president of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being locked into a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of anyone", he said.
Correa said that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be a pass that would allow her to travel to Ecuador, lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and emphasized that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the constraints of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we don't use that word in this case, but there have been discussions permanent.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European institutions", he said.
And he believes that "if Britain gave the safe-conduct tomorrow, it would end up".
And if Sweden, as is quite suitable for its legislation, and as it has done in other cases, asked Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa was able to reassert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that what he did was "not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that are detrimental to freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians or malicious perverse but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this light, he welcomed this is not that kind of journalists "neither bankers nor the hegemonic countries and bourgeois who dominate in Ecuador", and rather than put forward his re-election, "he approfondirait the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, by arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality "that destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
What is more, the president of Ecuador is "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this ruling is not respected.
It is a problem between a Latin American country and a Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together.
We must solve them together to overtake them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the right resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said it is "beneficial that Latin America seize international forums if the two countries agree to accept a judgment so strong that it is".
In reference to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has assured me that if he lost the primary to February 2013, he withdrew from public life.
On a personal level, I was never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be solved through the political power.
"My political movement thought it was me who guarantees this possible victory but we must accept that responsibility", he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and I retirerai then politics.
If we lose, I will also.
"It's my decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talk with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chavez", he commented.
The head of state of Ecuador today participated in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to sustain the progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to a belated detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he confirmed the test result: HIV-positive.
"It is as if the sky was dropped on the head", he says, referring to the time of the announcement, the physician had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man was hidden from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to inquire about her and her effort was such that he just celebrate his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients unity of HIV to the civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more scars.
Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided to say goodbye "because he was speechless".
In the meantime, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the head of the unit's HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologue and expert in HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those subsisting on drugs: up to 30 years to a rate of CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for those rising at a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that for someone who would receive a diagnosis HIV positive for 25 years, "as long as he remains under control, can live without problems up to 75 years", said the scientist asked.
To put this in context, you should know that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average.
If it is true that the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died.
In Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 dead until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why is there still death?
I think the problem is not with access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never missed medicine, the problem is that patients are able to stadiums very developed countries because they don't know they are infected, or they learn in the advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine in ten patients come when they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is deliver early diagnosis, and for that we have to offer screening tests, to all those who ask for it".
Experts and members of the State Council of AIDS prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who was making his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already infected with AIDS and sarcoma's sarcoma, a cancer is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are going to die and don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke out three times a week", they say, this is not my case.
The change was good, I eat well, exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents knew only that he was suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, as anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but share responsibility, I pay attention to me and the other person", says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share its intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World Day against AIDS.
They make the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, they should know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summed up the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, argues Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who have embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "it has actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now we have packages of 100 is very good, but the result is that even today, some do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
The question: 'What are you going to do? "asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers did not want to hear", says the journalist.
He proposes to reorient the inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only sold to retail outlets, but only found in distributors of public toilets and in places that are attending the young.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not their pay girls and the motel, as the governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not how it works sexuality, it's best to provide condoms to people already sexually active", he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 (12,158 cumulative cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state is the fourth state in the country in terms of number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV-infected people.
92% of the infections are through sexual contact, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for every case recorded four or five people who do not.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores debt restructuring of the group Vitro arrived via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. the scenario is causing a negative precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and having solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the starry banner, different approach to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main glass manufacturer of Mexico to seize the US Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge in the case said that creditors must register according to the bankruptcy law, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would mean to denounce the cooperation of international legal procedure in cases of insolvency of businesses with a transnational profile.
In fact, the law Model United Nations Uniformité Commercial International Law was set up for this purpose in taking the American Law Institute as a referee.
Secondly, the ruling establishes that without the vote intersociétés, recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy commercial debts incurred by Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Electoral Institute of des Faillites had guaranteed the debts.
Moreover, what is certain is that, because there remained the votes of subsidiaries in all ways of Vitro creditors who fought against it in U.S. courts, i.e. "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have acquired the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
Given a reversal by the court of appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that dealt with the US response costs in the country.
For the moment, the company of the family González Sada interjettera appeal at the same court of appeal for the vote to be held in its entirety, that is to say, with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance to pay the non-prospérité and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court had ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on business failures, pointing out that the freed up conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as the paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
Moreover, he noted that the country has fulfilled the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pileup of two parts: they overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.
General assessment

Héctor "Hetin Reyes" "The basketball is all my life"
The globe-trotteur basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as large as that of Héctor "Hetin Reyes".
The reason is that before a brain haemorrhage from condemning it in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, player of the national team of basketball, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball.
"I wore several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s", recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"The basketball is all my life".
Reyes did not exaggerate when he said that.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia reminiscent of his itinerary out standards, evidenced by.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he relishes the most are those that reminded her stint as a player in the team of the Vaqueros in the mid-1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"This has been my best years, I have benefited most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of the team ", said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have a big player for you, two metres.
You want? "
This is how to begin Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico.
Bartow was recommended Raymond gausse, who became a naturalized and who was a better shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship gausse would help us try to win another.
He was happy with gausse Vaqueros championship, but only at a distance as in 1988 he was the big brother of the federation.
In the meantime, he preferred to take advantage of his charges and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States at the World Cup warming-up tourney • tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if the Canadian judge did not play the last game ", said Reyes.
The 1990 World Cup team is the best national team that you view?
She is one of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and that we have taken a beating in the United States team, which was quite similar to that which won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there was also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not attend the global 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a World Cup warming-up tourney • delight in the tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement players suspended by the mess in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics in international tournaments are impressive.
Person to Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he has played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work being done by Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSO had up to 17 teams in a season.
What's next?
There are some things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example that the boys Ponce play only in their area and face only teams from other parts of the island in the national league.
Today, young people travel and play too, though not necessarily needed.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory and certification courses for leaders, the field staff and the referees.
It makes me happy.
What do you do today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at my time clips on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been in my side.
Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became internationally known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he was a businessman without scruples, daunting and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R into a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, regaining the role ironic that he loved the most", said the family.
The family of Larry and his friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who was performing the role of his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it goes much miss them.
"It was an exceptional person and he lived life", Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had acknowledged having much drink for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a malignant liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became known to television in the role of a regular guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he was the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius seductive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and return home.
He also played in two comedies that have remained little time on air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film credits include roles well received by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterly interpretation of the delicious detestable Larry Hagman as J.R. reached its greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotion in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to that, among other things, the series has reached a record of hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers on average before their screens and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which was attended by 50 million viewers.
It was J.R. 's sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had put pregnant and then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smile: a contractor dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to commit his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would be like epitaph for J.R", Hagman said in 1988.
You should write: "Ci-gît the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Here are the only party that it has lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, recalled Hagman this Friday as a man of "immense, both on screen and in life".
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The registration of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is underway, informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor the chain TNT did warn about the way will be incorporated into the death of Hagman in the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who found fame with classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of theatres in New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young décoratrice Swedish interior Maj Axelsson and that he has married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': the ruthless memoirs of J.R)
"I have nothing written in this book that might hurt someone or affect in any way", he said to the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active supporter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to help patients worried.
"I advises them, I renewed confidence, I'm with them when they come to operate and after", he said in 1996.
I try to give them a bit of comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it will not be easy for a small moment, but it will go well".
He has also been working against tobacco and participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the religious teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was an irresistible hook: the end of the "countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on 21 December, by which many people as evidence of the impending end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what awaited them over the following months: the recent catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the "Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time thought to trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this would be the half the apocalyptic more than I've ever known", said Professor Charmé this week to its students from the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If you analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and the You, it has been a very good period.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it is not the only teacher to teach courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of history.
At Temple, the assistant professor Barry vacker provides the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes like nuclear war, the zombis, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas abound with time", he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.
Though nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month, students scan movies with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible", said vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew Restall Amara Solari, an associate professor of the History of Art and welcomed, have teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The end of the world".
"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to run the course again, if the world does not disparaitrait", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "looming disaster", students must study, create projects and spend their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final review will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which the student leaves no other choice than to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world", said Restall.
The courses have proven quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours", said Restall about his course for students, composed of 35 students.
We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the semester, the share of people who asked if there was still space.
Students, for their part, claimed that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It intrigues me to see what people can do to comfort", says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, of the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychologie and Infirmerie 25 years, says viewing all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this area", he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students surveyed, much less a teacher, told us believe in the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited", says Julie zegle, last year at Temple, aged 21 and a native of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit that there is a fear about the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to a boom in such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it", he says.
The majority are in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that he gave here courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world", nous-a-t-il replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, there has been talk of many alleged dates of Judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date or philosophizing on the fact that the 21 December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several have told us that they thought go to parties "the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we rigolons together", said Samira Ford, student communications from 20 years ago.
