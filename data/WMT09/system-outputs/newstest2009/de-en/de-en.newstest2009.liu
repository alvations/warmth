The American legislators should after word of the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd as quickly as possible, to return to the negotiating table and the draft of the support of the financial system. 
That otherwise would face more countries will be affected by the collapse. 
A bloodbath of American shares 
The US House of Representatives on Monday, the plan for support of the financial system rejected, for up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 billion K) should be spent. 
The legislators ignoring the invitation by President George Bush, to support the plan. 
Bush's view, the fundamental causes of the dignity of the plan for the financial crisis rules and thus help to stabilise the entire economy. 
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday and the major stock indexes recorded the largest drop in more than 20 years ago. 
The Dow Jones index fell by nearly 7%, he had a similar collapse last recorded in 1987. 
The index was already before the vote has gone down, but there was little evidence that the resolution in the House of Representatives would not make the index occurred in a free fall. 
Congress makes concession: US government must 700 billion dollars into the banking pumps 
The supreme representative of the United States Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have committed themselves to a broader form of an agreement on a financial assistance for the American financial system. 
Is to be voted on at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance for the American financial system in a total of $700 billion (about 12 billion kronor) a breakthrough. 
However, that does no victory. 
The congressmen still must negotiate a few details of the agreement before they publish the final version of the law and able to vote on it. 
The plan in support of the financial system will be negotiated in Congress on Monday. 
On Sunday said that the chairman of the Committee on banking and financial services, the Reuters Barney Frank. 
In the Senate could probably be different, according to figures on Wednesday at the earliest vote on the plan. 
Economists should, according to a statement about the fact that the plan is approved, the first important psychological factor for a revival of financial markets. 
But it come down to a "disillusioned" because of the complex mechanisms, such as the markets could also help in practice. 
The Paulson plan must be effective. 
"We have made significant progress. 
We have our different views, such as a package to stabilize the market should look like, "said for the Agency Bloomberg the Democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
Their words suggest that it could still come to a final vote on Sunday. 
Met representatives of the legislators in the night for Sunday with the American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the Regierungsfonds in its final form. 
This is a Abkauf unverkäuflicher mortgage assets of the financial companies in the financial firms in heavy losses and the stability of the entire system at risk. 
"We are on the verge a definitive agreement on a plan to work on the market and the need to be effective. 
We must continue the Gesundungsplan even further, but I think we are getting close, "Paulson. 
A signal for Asiengeschäfte 
The global financial crisis is also in the share markets clearly reflected the sharp drop. 
The words of the democratic Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, said that the legislator, before Sunday in Congress to reach a final agreement. 
So that we might, in fact, the investors above shops on the Asian financial markets calm down in the first zone, where a decision by the Congress might influence the business on Monday. 
But so far is not clear when both chambers of Congress will vote on the bill, even confusion about whether the negotiations at the last minute from a problem not yet could fail. 
The legislators hope that it will be passed in the next few days. 
The law but it will be some changes. 
For the system to help some of the total amount will be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars as quickly as possible should be allocated as President George Bush urged. 
But the associate the Congress can block the rest of the money, if he has the impression that the programme is not its function, in another 100 billion dollars and, later, the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush sees progress in negotiations positive 
The President has a veto on that decision, but can outvote the Congress veto. 
Despite these changes, however, is the idea of the programme remained, which is based, finances for the Abkauf bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repaying their mortgages. 
"We have everything worked out. 
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the law, "the Senate on Monday, then the Republican Senator Judd Gregg. 
He was happy with the progress of the American President Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was pleased with the progress on Saturday and "value the beidseitige to try to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy". 
Restriction golden Fallschirme 
The chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators have been a responsibility for the Geldprogramm, protecting taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of benefits and a timetable for the financing of the plan agreed. 
The new law, the so-called golden Fallschirme limit for directors of the societies, which are involved in the programme and is a committee of the supervision of the Fund should fall. 
This is the Ministry of Finance. 
"We have worked extremely hard and a major progress towards an agreement that will work and reached for the market and for all Americans," Paulson is important. 
The plan is calculated by a aid for homeowners, the problems with the repayment of their mortgage. 
The government should negotiate new rates of mortgages it buys, which, with the aim of the monthly cost for the debtor and to reduce it to enable them to keep their homes. 
Marek psychological help. 
The proposed plan is after the main economists David Marek from Patria, gained a good idea, but the implementation will be very difficult. 
"This is because they do not know by what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets. 
That will determine how the financial sector and the government split the losses among themselves, "said Marek this week the server. Cz ihned. 
Now whether the plan is adopted or the beginning of next week, after Mareks view is not important. 
"It is much more important that the Congress members to agree to the plan to help him as quickly as possible. 
The psychological importance of the agreement on a adoption is that it is the most important at this moment, "said Marek. 
Duell on a knife edge: MP3 players against mobile phones. 
We advised you for your choice 
While nearly every mobile phone mp3-dateien playing, may still not use MP3 player. 
It so we, of course, that it is better to buy only a telephone. 
Despite everything, there is plenty of reasons why you should go a stand-alone player. 
The election depends on the kind of the use and the demands of the future owner. 
It is difficult for me to buy the safe at home a splendid expensive music players, in order to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc hearing. 
Even appear on this musical substance not lps, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for it. 
However, they have lps with kind of rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, dream you probably at least by this. 
This is with the music on travel, with komprimierter music - music in the simple mp3-format. 
Here too there is price and quality categories. 
For one, it is perhaps not acceptable for a player to spend eight thousand kronor in the same way, but a pink-floyd-fan headset would be very difficult to cope with the market for twenty crowns. 
Between those two extremes, there is plenty of room for everyone. 
The range is wide. 
The lifetime of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music player can happen much more than just music phones, but what can you do not even tacitly. 
No modern equipment is to use as universal as the telephone. 
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the Simsen, it can reflect both music and videos include a better, it is time to have a worse Fotoapparat and can perhaps also navigate. 
And if you add the Smartphons Kommunikatoren, and it was almost a small computer in the pocket. 
It is a minor miracle, because no fridge can complain and no television fotografieren. 
But the universality of mobile phones will also have its disadvantages. 
The more functions on her mobile phone use it, the more often, however, it must be nachladen. 
And the playing of music is one of the largest energy savings. 
Mobile phones can only a few hours longer than zehn-zwölf music playing, mostly it is much less. 
In this regard Music player (especially the easiest) clearly more efficient. 
You should therefore expect cheap mobile phones that they no longer than a few hours of music playing. 
If it is still a telephone call from and about the safety they prefer to buy a Ladegerät for office - which also applies to more expensive equipment. 
On MP3 players, you will not have this problem, also keep the less good at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with a time loading. 
Another problem, then, if you had bought the music on mobile phones. 
Regrettably, only a small part of the equipment on a usb-abschluss, moreover, not every mobile phone without special software on a PC directly. 
We cannot, of course, the music directly on a storage medium had bought tickets, but only a few readers without reduction with the tiny is ready, the memory cards used in mobile phones. 
In players they need up to exceptions (iPod) no special software. 
They need the machine only on usb-port with music to feed from your PC. 
Most mobile phones and player of a place Musikbibliothek, in an orderly manner after the name of the performers, the title of the Albums, the genre or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some devices are only the Baumstruktur of the address register, like the windows, some of them both (Explorer, Sony, Samsung, iriver Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Player, it is easier to use mobile phones could have more 
In the selection of a specific equipment, they should be especially after the lifespan of batteries, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of Klangs and, of course, also to inquire about bedien comfort. 
As their music above all aid and you hear every day, for example, in the tram briefly, then a given enough mobiles, the mp3-dateien scenes. 
What really almost every mobile phone. 
They must also not very monitor what Musikformate a mobile or a player can process. 
All MP3 create, and most of the music they will just get in this format. 
The format is one of the most widespread, and most of the equipment also wma-format music in the place. 
Less usual AAC (a format that use apple and its iPods). 
Better mobile phones will also be buying music online. 
It just needs on mobile Internet the relevant sides of a providers (or any other provider), and you can buy a song or album. 
This service in themselves can be a clincher for why they should lay Musikhandy. 
It is unfortunate that the offer the service providers badly and confined mostly only on rapid Radiohits. 
The prices are not the lowest. 
In general but the assumption is that it is precisely this kind of the sale of music (be it on GSM, internet or wireless Internet) dominate the music industry in the future. 
The mobile phone, most in itself. 
If they all want to listen to something, they resort to the mobile phone in the Jackentasche, while the player at home is forgotten. 
However, it is important whether they are always headphones, or at least a wireless Freisprecheinrichtung in their account. 
If not, you can fall back on the integrated loudspeakers, on almost every mobile phone, but only the least MP3 players. 
Probably the greatest advantage of Musikhandys is for many in the price. 
The cheapest cost usually less than three thousand kronor. 
For three and four thousand kronor you will get a very decent Walkman. 
The biggest drawback for the majority will be that no normal headphones are involved. 
The best and technically ausgereiftesten phones for ordinary headphones with a 3,5-mm-öffnung cost up to fifteen thousand kronor. 
The benefit of the player is, once again, in the light operation. 
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve. 
A minimum of functions, the similarity in the operation with the early normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record players is obvious. 
It is not interfering in the form of a mistake employees mobile Internet and then horrendous bill for data transfers. 
What equipment should now be single 
The cheapest mobile phones (such as Vodafone 527), usually on a Slot for memory austauschbare microsd (type m2, media, etc.). 
Even if the card nachkaufen, two thousand kronor. 
But respect. 
In the normally only be Basismodellen cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive can also read 8-gb-speicherkarten. 
If they already have a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then, after they resort, Cowon Creativ Emgeton or Sony, Samsung, iriver. 
According to capacity (Max. 2 GB) then they should not more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
This is one of the more demanding Hörern, they would prefer specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These machines have independent bedien knöpfe for MP3, and bedien comfort is so on the one mp3-players. 
Most here is Sony Ericsson, which Walkman phones from the series of the same user interface as the MP3 players sold individually. 
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand kronor, but with a greater storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long akku-lebensdauer (usually 15 hours, a maximum of up to 35 hours) you make MP3 players of the above manufacturers. 
The first virtual providers is already in this year after the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite perfect, the Czech providers offer virtually all services as their counterparts in Western Europe. 
However, something is missing here - a virtual service providers, the forces the classic at lower prices. 
Perhaps this will not be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile phone suppliers to the highest in Europe at all work, we have also often reported at mobile. Cz. 
It also confirmed the telecommunications authority tú, the attention that the price of a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European Union. 
After recent moves by the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, it is probably to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators will be cheaper SMS from abroad than at home. 
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic in comparison with Europe are so high? 
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really makes a declaration of war. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic, there are three network and a Penetration of far more than 100%. 
The mobile phone providers like against grumbling about the fact that it very much on the Czech market competition. 
The agrees with often the chairman of the Council of the Czech telecommunications authority (tú) by Pavel dvoák, often in the past, said that it had no place in the Czech Republic for another provider. 
It is likely that a classic with a own network providers not so many opportunities (incidentally, he would probably find little of frequencies). 
But there is still a possibility - a virtual providers. 
The entry of virtual providers on the mobile market brought a strong price reduction, in which the traditional mobile phone operators had to respond. 
There was even before the advent of such companies such as Tesco mobile or Virgin mobile on the market in the United Kingdom similar votes as in the Czech Republic. 
However, it turns out that there is a place for such providers and that they can really be successful. 
Not long after, by the way, you need to seek examples. 
In February that we have on the start of the virtual operator reported Mobilking in Poland. 
In just half a year, this providers, more than 100 thousand customers and so on to win fünfgrößten providers in the country levels. 
It is behind Mobilking Penta, the financial group in the Czech Republic, among other things, U: fon. 
The advantage of virtual providers is that we focus on a much more specific target group. 
In order to be able to function effectively virtual providers need much less customers: as a classic providers. 
They need no relatively high cost of construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network. 
In the world as protectors normally the virtual operators as low-cost- firms on the other, they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, although often of a less extensive service. 
That is, for example, Tesco mobile in the United Kingdom SMS at least half to cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be quite a good move, in a not klischeehafte target group. 
This providers: specifically directed to men. 
"real Kerle Mobilking - the providers, choose who you like and they can trust", so David Seibert, the chief executive of the mobile entertainment company, the company this virtual prey. 
Hard to tell whether a similar plan in Poland also could get a foothold in the Czech Republic. 
Doubts the press spokesman of Vodafone Miroslav epický: "the Czech market is for a market share, in the most virtual operators based on relatively small. 
He is also in the view of the services offer relatively saturated. " 
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone operators, not my 
But it is almost certain that, if a virtual mobile phone operators, this is not Mobilking conquered the Czech Republic. 
"We talk about an expansion of this successful project in the Czech Republic, but the negotiations are not very hopeful. 
It is more likely to produce a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region ", says in a phone call for mobile. Cz, press spokeswoman Jana studniková Penta, the financial group. 
Indirectly confirmed it so that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are not well disposed towards this idea. 
The opposite, they are attempting to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor. 
Their interest in a start of a virtual mobile phone operator already shows the group for some time, Novera gts would like to do the one step further, to a real competitor by Telefónica O2 customers in the area firms. 
"We have a great interest in our customers not only both fixed, but also mobile telephone telecommunications service providers. 
And the sooner the better. 
We have repeatedly about that possibility negotiated with all the Czech mobile operators. 
With some of them, we were able to achieve progress in the negotiations ", so the press spokesman for the group by Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now come better times. 
From not official information suggests that the first virtual operators by the end of the year, perhaps, is to be expected. 
So far, but this is an insurmountable wall of silence. 
"at the moment, we do not imagine that in the Czech Republic square for a full-fledged virtual providers. 
The Czech market compared to other markets has great specifics. 
So far, we still have no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, "says said in its statement for mobile. Cz Vlastimil LRRD from the press department of Telefónica O2. 
On the nature of the Czech market also reject other providers. 
The press spokeswoman of presenting historian Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the statement by O2 added: "so far we have no viable and mutually advantageous project, found on which one could continue to build." 
And it adds: "in the network of presenting until the end of the year is hardly a virtual providers appear. 
In this moment, we should already have a concrete offer in order to be able to think at such short notice. " 
Vodafone is his attention more to comply with the requirements of the own 3g-lizenz. 
Miroslav epický thinks this: "for negotiations with potential virtual providers, we are open, especially in the field division of cost and infrastructure. 
This is exactly what we see in the view of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area lies in search of a partner in the development of a shared network for a rapid mobile Internet. " 
The responsible authorities, hand in hand with the providers 
The actions of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand another provider more competition, this would mean to lower prices and will also lead to a decline in profits. 
So why one should make it easier for such competitors from entering the market? 
The providers can pull together when it comes to something is also shown by the long bounced back and forth about the generation of U: fon. 
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of tú was at the time, as U: fon came on the market for presenting, by society. 
It also confirm the publicly accessible information from the tú-webseiten. 
But is just now U: fon as an argument why we should not allow a virtual operators. 
Historian Martina Kemrová said: "the competition environment of the mobile telephony market was also recently by the market entry of a fourth mobile provider. 
In light of the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is evident that a new player in the market itself and, above all, his services would be tough demands. " 
In light of this approach of the mobile phone operators, however, surprised by the absolute indifference of the Czech regulatory authorities. 
It is the attitude of the tú in Czech, sadly, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries - not is competent to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is solely the Office for the protection of the economic competition (úohs). 
This but referred to this issue as a whole, its very typical attitude. 
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would be possible after it to a contract between a mobile phone operators and a virtual providers on the leasing of the necessary infrastructure. 
No such Treaty has so far been closed, as the supply of potential stakeholders for the traditional operators probably was not sufficiently interesting ", so in his response to our request by the Department Kristián Chalupa úohs foreign relations. 
By representatives of the supplier would not be surprised by such a formulation. 
From one office to represent the interests of the consumer, among other things, to ensure that no one is abused his position in the market, this is more than worrying. 
In particular, adding: "If Kristián Chalupa abroad, where virtual operators work quite normal to see their market entry to a price cuts for mobile telephone services has helped." 
But are probably the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction not with the interests of the úohs. 
Really shocking is in this case the almost touching line of the three mobile phone operators, based on their reactions. 
The question of whether it was a coincidence, is obvious. 
As well as the absolutely same price for petrol stations certainly only by chance and the result of a tough competition. 
"the authority has discovered no evidence on this issue, for a resolute action against the competition, and therefore suggest that it has no reason, in any way, to intervene in the matter. 
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so it has also not conducting increased responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The instruments necessary for the opening up of the mobile phone market for virtual providers lack probably also the regulatory authority for telecommunications, led Chalupa in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points. 
There are, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets, drafted by the tú, after the telecommunications, from the point of view of economic competition a single market. 
On such a market has, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominating position. 
Some legal experts, however, offer a different perspective - for access to the market of a virtual supplier has always required the approval of the devised. 
And the mobile phone providers - logically - for his network the monopoly. 
The means that they are in a certain segment will require a dominant position. 
Even if it refuses to play ball with this argument but not for the úohs, it should be a warning that at least three mobile phone operators strikingly similar approach. 
This show complaints of a number of interested parties (including the society Novera gts) that they are in negotiations with all providers on very similar obstacles. 
Buck-passing in the tú is in the telecommunications services a right of common trick with the úohs to distance itself from the whole affair. 
It was already in a number of similar cases. 
It is, unfortunately, not achieved in the recently reviewing of the telecommunications law adopted the enlargement of the powers of the tú on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts from promised an improvement in the situation. 
The, the representatives of úohs know only too well, but you have probably other interests. 
It is already, if nobody watching 
Unappreciated, once the functioning of any pseudo virtual operators, of which there in the Czech mobile networks equal several. 
There are companies which own price lists for mobile telecom services, but they spend only partly made public. 
Normally is, after all, the companies that operate in the area of multilevel-marketing. 
Offer their own mobile telephone services, for example, Amway Starlife Bohemia, telecom and others. 
The price lists of these companies usually only reach to select. 
The joke of the matter is that the firm towards the operator as classic Firmenkunde appearance, a lot of SIM cards. 
He then as important customer receives special offers of prices (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators continue to sell a similar ban. 
"If there are some cases which describe them, then it is a violation of contractual conditions, which we will deal, which put an end to the cooperation with the relevant society," said historian Martina Kemrová to our question on this issue. 
However, it is unlikely that something with the leaders of the mobile phone operators not gets about. 
Particularly in the case of the three mentioned companies can act to thousands of customers. 
No operator, however, is opposed to such an approach. 
Flow from the work of these companies that they are not negligible gains, you will at the same time - in contrast to the real virtual suppliers - not by the real official marketing. 
On possible problems Miroslav epický closely: "the law allows these types of speculation, despite all the services provided by the firms are only a very small percentage of customers use. 
This must also accept that the sim-karte in their telephone not on their behalf, so you can have not used as the normal customer of the mobile phone providers. " 
The alone, however, the tú at least strange. 
Also gives another question for the úohs. 
The mobile phone operators shut their eyes before such an approach, why do you lock themselves against a virtual providers? 
It is to add that the úohs to uncover such activities have fairly strong powers, and if they do not want, it must, not with the declaration of providers that they knew nothing about it and its business conditions would be content to forbid it. 
When the Czech Republic is no longer in the most expensive 
As the text said on a number of occasions, the market entry was a sharp price drop virtual operators in the various services. 
They have practically in all countries, where virtual operators were created, the traditional providers, which is trying to prevent virtually, more or less. 
You practically identical arguments were used - is too small, or very gesättigter market, problems in the quality of services, etc. 
In the highly developed countries in these moments but blew the regulatory bodies, which is far from the interests of the mobile service providers, but the their customers tried to maintain. 
Either by formal measures or not formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by further. 
Unfortunately raise the Czech regulatory bodies to the whole event, like a hot potato. 
Based on our experience we can not help rid that ambiguity in the powers in these cases is more than favourable. 
But let us not give up so easily. 
If the background information is correct and soon a virtual providers, will the Czech mobile market moving again soon, perhaps. 
If a supplier to the emergence of a virtual mobile phone provider, it will not remain inactive, úohs when it comes to reject other interested parties (to discriminate against them). 
And the Czechs will no longer use more expensive than the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech national anthem has four new versions. 
They are seeking the best of

What looks like the new "anthem"

The Vorstadtbusse card readers have the driver of the kitty. 
In boarding the use must be contained not only in the case of the driver, but the Opencard is in a marker post at the side of the purse. 
So that the driver controlled the validity of the aufgespielten coupons. 
"if a passenger the validity of the aufgespielten coupons to check is nothing simpler than the driver to make this information", so Drápal to ask. 
A passenger, who did not travel with suburb buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupons ends in turn can go to the self-service machines, where the coupons on the card be posed. 
Here, the information on the validity of its documents on the display of equipment. 
The Sudeten demanded a referendum by the United States. 
The Sudeten Germans had in 1945 at the affiliation of the Böhmerwaldes asked to the United States. 
This is from a letter in the collections, the Südböhmischen scientific library is being stored. 
If we are not part of Germany and Austria, so we want to be at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire should be 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans have written to the US President. 
This is, among other things, from a letter in a private archive has been preserved and the today in the proceedings of the Südböhmischen scientific library will be retained. 
The German of Krumau ask the American presidents in the letter that he should the return of the '' Sudetengaus - on the basis of the Munich Agreement of Hitler was taken to the Czechoslovakia. 
"We have understood and the situation we really want to be sure that, in the words of the American units not as oppressors and enemies German territory, but as liberators", it says in a letter, with the words "people, which the fate of Sudeten hearts' sign. 
Since the end of the Czechoslovakia - the Sudeten Germans in knowledge of the Czech national character - suggests that it brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery would expect the author of the letter to ask the American President, for today and continue to hold the protection to take control of the Bohemian Forest. 
"We cannot believe that, without regard for the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area a grant for US foreign state, minority and trying to remove and nothing has contributed to the victory of the Allies' is the letter to read. 
The reason why the authors can not sign is supposed to be the fear of Rachegelüsten "the Czech oppressors". 
If the US President, doubts about the affiliation of Bohemian Forest, whether there is enough German harbour in Böhmerwaldgau if he would initiate a referendum on whether the inhabitants are part of the United States or under the protection of the United States wanted to live. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of the post-war world may sound a little naïve, but he has a good eye witnesses, according to some picture of what was then the expectations of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian German at least guessed that I have had to negotiate their removal from the Republic would, just a few of them stood at all such a possibility. 
Some waited for the United States and Britain for Sudeten would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believed that they could simply in Czechoslovakia. 
The also confirms the famous Austrian journalist from Budweis, Gustav Chalupa dates. 
He was in the war as Budweiser German in the navy, on the Baltic Sea. 
At the end of the war when he was in British captivity and it into a war prison camp after Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian German came to him that he should teach you Czech. 
"They believed that if you heimkämen, would put them to the Czech Republic", so Chalupa passe. 
No one of the German prisoners of war, before the war in Czechoslovakia had lived in his view, so that it on the basis of the bene-dekrete from the Republic would drive. 
Not heard - then you pay. 
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers' 
Most expensive action to safety on the road in the Czech history. 
So we could characterize the emotional media campaign, the Ministry of Transport wants to launch on Wednesday. 
The authority of Minister ALE ebíek promises are drivers of dangerous behaviour negotiated behind the wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million kroner will, on radio, on television in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on Flyern run. 
It is too quickly, the drivers of driving will deflect and drink-driving. 
And also remind you, anzugurten Fahrtantritt. 
The campaign wants especially young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians and not least professional drivers into certain speeches. 
And what is shown in the spots? 
Especially stories of people who appeal to the emotions. 
The "bloody" slogan throughout the campaign. 
Not heard - then you pay. 
The words' 'are not heard in large letters on a mark shield. 
And then in a Blutlache am paying the word ''. 
This should mean a moment with the Unaufmerksamkeit can pay for their own lives. 
The spots will be the viewer until 2010 schocken. '' 
The department has similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries where one inspiration from normal images with dramatic footage of accident victims can see. 
It promises is that the accident figures and the number of deaths on the Czech road down. 
The spots were presented by the Agency euro RSCG put together. 
The carrot and the stick for the motorists' 
"for the driver goes the slogan carrot and stick. 
The carrot means that you, for example, if you travel in red, save time. 
The stick is the threat of a punishment or an accident. 
The driver of the risk must be remembered ", so the traffic psychologist of the hospital na Homolce Martin koán. 
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising necessary, believes the psychologist. 
Even less effective are the tables, in his opinion, the driver on a threat to your attention. 
"It is a static blackboard on the eve of an danger warning, it will probably soon with the environment, and the driver verfließen, you will no longer perform," says koán. 
Olmert would almost all of the occupied territories back in exchange for peace 
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert pushed for the return of virtually all areas which have been occupied in 1967, and therefore the Jordanland, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if you are in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria could close. 
He emphasised this in an interview with the daily on Monday by Jediot Achronot were printed. 
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary, almost all of them (occupied) areas back, if not all of them," said Olmert told the newspaper. 
"We still retain a certain percentage of these areas, but we are going to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) must cede without this, because there will be no peace," he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return also will include East Jerusalem. 
"the person who wants to security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers on his legs roles, as it happened one of my best friends, will forgo part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
After word of the Prime Minister, it will be necessary, a "special solution for the Tempelbern and sacred and historic places", on the territory of the old. 
"the person who the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city wants to retain entire Arabs, will have to integrate. 
It will not work, "he endorsed further. 
Withdrawal from the Golan Heights 
Olmert spoke for a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which it believes that a condition for the signing of a peace treaty with Syria. 
However, this would also some effort on the part of Damascus. 
"my proposal with Syria is not solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan peace," Olmert reiterated. 
"The Syrians know only too well what you have to give up the Golan back. 
They are on their current relationship with Iran; you will forgo their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; you will forgo to the constant support to surrender to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terror network al-khaida and the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "grant konkretisierte the Prime Minister. 
Questions: are Stewards after the accident on the bus illegal? 
The law knows it is not, in a Fernreisebus Umherlaufen not allowed the 
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the society student agency in the proximity of the Italian Padua, the question is whether Stewards and passengers on the bus during the journey to run along back and forth. 
"We wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, it is the work of a Stewards in breach of the law on the road", the spokesman for the Department of Transportation Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, in the last week, a young died Stewardess, was probably caused by the driver of the lorry, the path of the bus kreuzte. 
The young woman sat in that moment, in addition to the driver unfortunately, at the least safe place in the car, even if they have two other jobs. 
A bus at the time but it can also have an accident or sharply curbed, in which the Steward austrägt coffee or newspapers. 
Also plays a role, whether the bus after the Fahrzeugbrief Stehplätzen is also equipped with. 
If this is not provided for in the bus, the passengers sit. 
The Fernreisebusse of student Agency have no Stehplätze; what is the director of the company, janura Radim, compared with aktuáln confirmed. Cz. 
"This we have discussed with the Treasury first, and it has not agreed to the movement of travellers. 
They later scaled back, and we have come to a consensus that the passengers during the journey can go to the toilet, if you have your seat, "he informed his position with. 
The law makes no Steward 
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a Stewards - no law describes this role. 
But there are no law prohibits the transporter to provide services. 
The law on the roads only the concept vehicle companions; its rights and obligations defined, "adds, but not, clearly, the spokesman of the Ministry Hanzelka added. 
The Director of the Department of Transport vehicles on the road Ministry Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the law to cover this issue. 
"It depends on whether the bus in the product approval also has Stehplätze. 
This is everything, "he said. 
Buses under parts in Stadtbusse Stehplätze is where it is limited and the maximum speed, with Nahverkehrsbusse Stehplätzen and a higher level of speed and Fernreisebusse without Stehplätze with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with seat belts. 
As on the plane, says the professional 
The besip-fachmann Jaroslav hoín looks for road safety in the movement of Stewards on board a bus not essential. 
"in a liquid vehicle is not threatening many dangers, the situation is comparable with the service on board an aircraft. 
Here, too, is not sure when turbulence, and the Stewardess can find themselves in the head. " 
"slow sharply, however, a bus, then, of course, also apply the laws of physics. 
As in the Stadtbus or in a tram. 
The safety of the Stewards must clarify the carrier by internal rules ", he says, and also says that these issues from the perspective of the law not fully resolved. 
Janura is prepared to provide services to remove 
Student agency offers as the only Busfirma services of Stewards. 
The company employs some 200 people in this function. 
The director is their profession not even after the accident as a risk to drink. 
"as soon as I but gets the impression that the profession of risk the future Stewards, I will remove him. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive the travellers in boarding. 
That would also reduce costs, "he says. 
As interest in the security justified the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, the absence of Stewards in his buses. His company, but only a fraction of lines compared with student agency. 
"We have no hostesses, we have been opposed it from the start. 
Ends sooner or later it with some fatal accident ", he had not quite a year for týden. Cz. 
It was an incredible tragedy 
The accident of a lines bus to Naples was a young Stewardess Málaga Pilsen from the region, the two years for the society had worked. 
The Slovenian lorry was probably without abgebogen blinken of the state to touch the bus and had blocked the steam. 
The driver of the bus tried to evade by a strong manoeuvre, but with the right front kollidierte with the lorry. 
That the two jobs for the Stewards janura disputes are sold. 
"This jobs can not be reserved for long-distance, they are blocked." 
Firm wants to sue the lorry drivers. 
With a compensation for the family of the young woman, the agency will not wait on the Court's judgment, a financial compensation they expected but also from the culprits. 
A change in the law? 
Not in sight 
A precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus, which could bring a statutory regulation, which involved a team of experts of the Department of Transportation dreißigköpfiges already operates more than a year. 
"This, however, is still at no specific conclusion. 
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones in the journey ", so professional hoín. 
"The Transport Ministry considers the activities of the Stewards not as something that passenger safety, much could threaten Hanzelka", with the control of the safety of the buses within the jurisdiction of the police and the employment protection authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hopes to Frankfurt 
In big words are lacking in the letter of the westlb- board of directors to the staff of the House. 
By bringing together units of the Düsseldorfer Geldinstituts with the Frankfurt could deka-bank Sparkassen- Kapitalmarkthaus "at the heart of the financial group", it says in the letter reported on Monday. 
The WestLB Kompetenzblock would result in a '' with sustainable profitability in such a deal. 
And could such a link the decisive push to further Bündelungen banking sector in the country. 
If so, it is more difficult time a board wants to demonstrate ability to act. 
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure. 
Not only by the European Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for financial services supervision, the national government of Westphalia nordrhein- has made it clear recently that the time is pushing to find a solution for the future. 
As sort of a link between the deka-bank, the savings for their clients, and the WestLB Investmentsfonds know for some time, however, is already the speech, also at Frankfurt side. 
Although deka-bank-chef Franz Waas during the presentation of the half-yearly figures at the end of August, know that in a merger of the House to the highway with a Landesbank Mainzer, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he see no sense. 
But the Board of the Deka, the ever at half of the country, banks and savings banks associations, the board, charged with the WestLB talks on joint business activities. 
Yet it would order marktgeschäft and parts of the capital. 
The talks have, of course, it has only just begun on financial centre. 
The deka-bank who, with their 3,000 staff, one of the most important employers in the city of Frankfurt, is not the first time, the speech, when it comes to consolidation in the savings banks sector. 
In 2003 it for a moment as possible with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz deka-bank and merging the Helaba. 
This is Dreierbund, however, it was nothing. 
Hardly had the plans has become public, the Hessische provincial government against the participation of Helaba point. 
The two other homes were not each other. 
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it has repeatedly thought about a combination of deka-bank with regional banks. 
Most recently, however, Günther, managing director of the Helaba Merl, against overstatement about a conjunction with his house. 
Regardless of tyres but seems to recognize that a move together the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the Landtagswahl in Bayern is over, can be the first with a combination of bayernlb Landesbank Baden-Württemberg closer. 
For the Helaba is that is not necessarily good news. 
The pressure to further mergers should rise gradually, they are in favour of the partners. 
In the south, they would be confined junior partner, the financial crisis so far, even though they were much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
A engagement with the West LB has, in turn, the Sparkassen- Giroverband hessen-thüringen, and with 85 percent of the Helaba is involved, at the beginning of the year, a barrier. 
If anything, the North LB would remain. 
Such strategic considerations, but only one side of the coin. 
On the other, there is the question of how different business models of the individual houses link up with each other. 
In June, Merl, the key question, what is the business model of the future capacity of the country banks should be guaranteed, and by the German Sparkassen- Giroverband has not been answered. 
At the end could also be an disassembly of the West LB, but there are, of course, is not wanted. 
It is in the letter of the board of directors said, it will certainly an "overall solution" for the House. 
As is the case with the convergence of individual units with the deka-bank under one roof, only time will tell. 
The second Wiesnwochenende is known as a "Italians weekend" 
For Elena, it is the first for Luca for the third or fourth time. 
But this time, Elena as his friend, and so everything was different, he says. 
Behind you, the fünf-liter-bierfass render the brand is a massively built bearded and shows the approximately 200 oktoberfest-reisenden Kehle, of the deep tones he can bring. 
Elena, Luca, then only a slap a Kuss. 
From Bologna, they are Verona. 
From here, the Busparkplatz Puorta Nuova, in addition to the station launch at 11.45 p. m. on this evening, "four buses destinazione Monaco, festa della birra 'arrival probably 6.00 a. m.. 
Three buses are, above all, the Italians in a bus travel reservations, only Brazilians. 
In a corner of the Parkplatzes sing alongside the South Americans already have celebrated their flag during the night. 
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, it was nothing for Italians. 
Marco, a long cloak with Pelzimitatfutter and a lens with broad silver bars, include the buses. 
For five years, they are the Oktoberfest, three swing it this year alone. 
At night on the Wiesn, during the day, at 10.30 p. m. back. 
Übernachten would only lead to unnecessary expenses, says Marco. 
The journey costs 75 euros, the Willkommensumtrunk brewed with kaiser-bier, in keeping with the Bavarian purity, health insurance and the German-speaking Reiseleitung - Marco has visited in Frankfurt - including a language lecture. 
The buses and roles in the night, on the Autostrada Brennero direction ''. 
There is no beer, not yet. 
Soon, there will be calm in the bus passengers sleep. 
As well, you will still need their forces. 
In Brixen and will be kept in Holzkirchen, where a lot of other buses with Italian plates on the motorway near Munich 8 pause again. 
As Marcos group at half past 7 a. m., planned to be in the early in the car park near the Theresienwiese, there are already some 50 other buses from across Europe. 
Elena, Luca and the other collection, Marco believes that a final address, declared the Angriffsplan. 
One: the yellow Käppchen controversy. 
It says the left '', in Fraktur Oktoberfest, as well as the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando. It". 
Secondly: "if the doors to run Bierzelt opened, it says," Marco calls in the morning. 
'' run and run the jobs at the back of the Zelts. 
"not ahead, otherwise we block, and not all Gelbmützen on the same beds in the area, handing out!" 
The standards, brüllt Marco, cost 8.25 euro. 
And so not forgotten. 
"the security people show that we were well behaved. 
When the jobs verlasst, are you way! " 
Three: "this evening here again try to point half eleven!" understood? 
And already is's to Wiesn. 
On their way to a yellow sever ties as milestones of the trees in signs, and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party. 
One of the withdrawal will be armed. 
It is the second Wiesnwochenende, known as "Italians' weekend. 
Accurate data on figures do not exist; there is talk of 50 000, which is on the way across the Alps and make muscle in the Bierzelte, 10% of all this weekend visitors are being asked to be flown over from Italy arrived. 
The Munich police will increase by seven police officers from the South Tyrol, Italian voluntary workers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a Nations statistics, in which the Italians before British (about 60 operations) and Austrians (approximately 80) with around 200 medical Versorgungen first place. 
This is particularly popular among Italians Hofbräuzelt. 
Sleepless nights for the lender Hypo real estate 
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Federal Finance Minister peer Steinbrück only in the last week. 
As well that the politicians used the word "relatively" and also einflocht that the German banking sector of the troubled developments will not spared. 
Because it is now at the weekend. 
The listed in the Dax index traded Munich real estate finanzierer Hypo real estate (HRE) by a consortium of German banks receives a billion credit of shielding the turmoil in the markets. 
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday, the loan assistance accounted for up to 35 billion. 
The Hypo real estate, part need only verzinsen in taking advantage of it. 
The money come from both private and public banks. 
Backdrop, losses at the subsidiary Depfa. 
The state finanzierer, according to a newspaper report for Langfristprojekte, for which he has yet to make money, extremely short term - and rescheduled because of the lack of confidence in the markets now is no longer possible. 
In the first half of 2008, the Bank was the Barreserve by 95 percent 2.37 million euros on the equity capital also had fallen slightly from 1.6 at 1.45 per cent. 
The current yield and the net revenue deriving from financial operations were compared with the period last year to zero Zuschreibungen found the proceeds to demands and certain securities, and from the dissolution of reserves in the credit business for more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros. 
Only thanks to higher proceeds of refunds of downstream billing costs from the restructuring of the former depfa-gruppe and from the reimbursement of interest after the tax and from the business errand for associated companies, had the Ertragsminus with about 16 per cent fall even moderate. 
The former state finanzierer, after its privatisation in 1990 with first commercial real estate loans verspekuliert, which then were eliminated in the Aareal bank. 
In the traditional state funding had earned too little of the Depfa then reinforced in infrastructure projects, and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the state committed, 'public partnership (PPP) and international diversifizierrt. 
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo real estate, the repayments now to make a "substantial material effect" on the companies' profit and loss account, the group hot rather vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was cancelled. 
It was already for 2007 has been reduced by two-thirds. 
The Hypo real estate, since the depfa-übernahme finanzierer a significant Heads of State and infrastructure. 
It is more than other institutions of the refinancing on inter-bank market dependent, as it has no customer deposits. 
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending among banks largely dried up again, as the banks hoard their liquidity. 
The Hypo real estate needs a year for a part - around 50 billion - the credit portfolio of Depfa short-term funds to refinancing. 
After communication from the Hypo real estate, is the financing requirements of the group, with the credit for the foreseeable future "and the company covered by the influence of the currently operate largely shielded from the hands of incompetent international money markets". 
From other sources is to hear that thanks to the money the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009. 
The hre-vorstandsvorsitzende Georg Funke said however that the Hypo real estate group for the foreseeable future the money markets will not need. 
Bundesbank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Authority (bafin) assume that the onto the market now Hypo real estate group is assured. 
This is for shareholders and creditors of the Bank of hope. 
But given the dynamism and uncertainties of the crisis, there is perhaps no certainty. 
It is even not unthinkable that the funding not fully must be used. 
But also the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After late on Sunday evening after the Bank reported before the insolvency, nor can at least temporary rescue people not to calm down. 
The share price collapse by 75 per cent on 3.30 euro. 
The converse is quite well Anleihenkurse. 
Strokes of the priority debts are hardly moved to show the courses of nachrang- bonds clear after. 
Most affected are the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably over the term of beyond 2009. 
Hypo-real-estate-anleihen used to seem a speculative investment alternative, whose Werthaltigkeit after the sharp tightening of the banking crisis and of the Institute itself, with the takeover of the Depfa the crisis had only shelter than the stability of the international financial system dependent. 
As long as the central banks, governments and less risky commercial banks to support the system are still prepared, as long as can be proud of a cancellation of the pension. 
Or it is currently the hardly anyone will dare to hope that the financial crisis - over the next 15 months is broken. 
But in light of the Teilverstaatlichung überschlagenden news is likely to safety from the bordering currently only a hopeful. 
This is especially Langzeitgläubigern some sleepless nights with the decision, whether they are separated from their commitment. 
Kurzzeitanleger can use in a line after a loss lecture for the future abgeltungs Kursgewinne tax payments in later years. 
The secrets of bento-box Sylvana. 
As Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, on the first day of the Tachibana Highschool, will present the girl to catch kichern, the German is total "Kawaii"! 
What that means? 
Sylvana Mangas already knows from the floor in the new austausch-log told - by Japan. 
"the first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
I had before the Bammel Schulweg. 
I live on the edge Tokios Kawasaki and drive in the direction of 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I did not intervene. 
At the beginning of the teaching Tachibana seems not so strictly defined as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils from 8 p. m., a tumble by about twenty nine a brief Besprechungsrunde with the teacher begins, the home room. '' 
But before the teaching began, I was present in the series, me. 
I am also is not the type, the happy to speak before people, a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had Schuluniform, I have an old rock attracted to my Gastmutter Bluse Kniestrümpfe, blue and black leather shoes. 
In this lift so I did before the bench and tried to put things right where she Sayonara to say: '' - I would like... Sylvana Sylvana, come from Germany and voted in a week of birthday. 
In the moment, I was very happy that I have more than two years ago, had begun to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class have all gewunken getuschelt sniggering and constantly, and I have heard the word "Kawaii". 
The knew I had from my Mangas. 
It is part of the vital importance of Japanese girls and means done her rhetoric, sweet ''. 
Then I am quickly gehuscht at my place. 
The girls beside me has been widely gegrinst, you thought it was an honour that the exchange should be sitting next to her schoolgirl. 
The rest of the hour was fairly calm, but as the Gong message drummed out, I was absolutely bombarded. 
All talked to me and asked kicherten confusion and holes in the gut - it is really difficult to understand, Japanese English. 
In the break from their Bentos packten all then. 
My Gastmutter as a lunchbox had also made me - that is something other than the tedious German Pausenbrote. 
I had rice with herbs, small sausages from cucumbers and algae, salad, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
Mostly I have not got a clue what exactly I am here in Japan. 
The matter is strange and lunch entirely novel. 
It is clear that everything is truly lecker. 
Well that, with the exception perhaps also lodged salzig brrrr! 
The Bentos in Japanese schools are not only easy lunch. 
It is sometimes that a girl a young a suicide zubereitetes Bento, which they then pays particularly skilful herrichtet - in the hope that the young in the Pausensnack closer. 
I read in my manga-comics. 
I am once eager to find out whether I can see that here too. 
Why Japan? '', because all my friends have asked me when I told them that I, for one year in Tokyo wants to go to school. 
I have always said. 
"because it fascinates me time." 
I read for many years, ideally Mangas. 
And the comic strip and so I understand the culture is better at some point, I have also started to learn a bit in Japanese. 
For me was absolutely clear that I had to travel here at some point. 
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and behaviours. 
And, it sets great store here. 
On one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditionally. 
And because everything is so well organised, I have also felt here, not yet lost, although Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen. " 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a Schabe sanctuary in danger, that means that they also feels fear? 
The Neurowissenschaftler Joseph ledoux is convinced that a lot of animals have feelings. 
Only, as one check whether you could feel the same if you, like we conduct? 
In the Internet Edge magazine '' has been going on for several years, distinguished scientists published contributions. 
Mirror presented online in a series of selected responses to the question, 'What do you think for true, without being able to show this? " 
I believe that animals feelings and other awareness, without conditions have so far I or anyone else could prove where we are not even able to prove that other people of responsibility. 
But in this case, at least we should hope that all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
However, as soon as we move on to other species and issues of the sensitivity or raise awareness in general, we are entering impassable terrain, because the hardware disagree. 
If a rat in danger, it is the same as many other animals: it is dead, retreats or attacks. 
Like human behaviour, which led some scientists to conclude a comparable subjective experience. 
Point, however, I do not believe. 
Two aspects of the brain structure will make it difficult to our subjective experience to transfer to the animals. 
The almost always close to a human consciousness associated with the circuits the roadside präfrontalen cortex (because of his participation in the short memory and the Ausführungs- / management functions). 
This vast region is in humans developed much higher than in the rest of the primates and seems to be lacking entirely in other creatures. 
At least those aspects of our consciousness, präfrontalen depend on the cortex, including the know who we are, and the ability to plan and to decide there is reason to believe that the man even by the other primates. 
Another dramatic nature, in the linguistic human nature: because such a large part of his Erlebens is associated with language, it is often said of the awareness of pesticide. 
Animals in this case could be ruled out. 
But also depended much if conscience of language, it certainly would affect them, so animal awareness, as it may be structured, probably very of most of our differences bewusstseins- situations. 
It is difficult to determine how to raise awareness in other animals may be. 
If, as some internal and subjective measure, yet, either because of the specific hardware, from our own experience, that brings us to analyse his research into major problems. 
Most of my comments relate to the content of the deliberate Erlebens, but there is also another aspect of the awareness, the science should be more easily accessible. 
It could be the consciousness processes of animals without regard to investigate their content, and that is exactly what is happening in studies on the short memory of primates, especially in the case of the Visualisierung. 
But for this approach, the Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed up instead we are transferred to the neural Korrelate of consciousness than on the causal mechanism: both may be identical or not. 
It is interesting that this approach also stressed the importance of präfrontalen for achieving the cortex Visualisierung. 
What is now for the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotive system such as the fear in one of his own activity is conscious brain activated. 
What we describe as a "fear", is the mental state in which we find ourselves if the activity of the brain lokalisierten defence system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) working memory. 
Feelings are seen as closely tied to the regions of the cortex, the primates and particularly the human arena. 
Associated with the linguistic nature emerge paragon of varying degrees of sensitivity, because we need to use the words and grammar situations can categorise and differentiate ourselves alongside other fault. 
Antonio Damasio, for example, on the other hand, thinks that feelings from primitiveren activities in the body feeling regions of the cortex and the Hirnstammes Jaak Vandemeulebroucke Pankseep similar to emerge, but that is focused more on the Hirnstamm. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution, have not changed much there could well be involved in a generic overarching feelings. 
The theory, I can not disagree with me, but I think it is unbeweisbar. 
Pankseep argues that what in rats and people like fear, is also likely to appear in both cases: but how they can check if rats and people the same experience, when they behave in the same way? 
A Schabe sanctuary in danger if they also feels fear? 
In my view, no resemblance of behaviour can simply prove Erlebens opportunities. 
It helps the neurale comparison on: rats and people have similar Hirnstämme Schaben, on the other hand, not even a brain. 
But is the Hirnstamm responsible for feelings? 
And even if you could show that for the people: how they wanted to prove it in rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even Schaben (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should prove it. 
And because their feelings likely differ radically from our (as the human awareness on specific becoming a circles and on language is based), erforsche I prefer the emotional behaviour as the emotional feelings of rats. 
Here offer any progress on the neural level, provided it in rats and people of the same. 
As I language and conscience erforsche in rats, including not feelings, I do not know whether they exist. 
This may consider to be short-sighted, but I come forward, rather than constantly to run against a wall. 
I am just a practical Emotionalist.

Influences flight of dark matter Raumsonden 
For years in a bathing mysteriöses phenomenon to search for doom: dark matter influences the speed of Raumsonden during so-called swing-by-manöver. 
Experts are worried that the Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity seems not quite right could be. 
Almost 18 years was flying the spacecraft went '' Ulysses' 'through the space. 
Because soon gefrierenden fuel lines, it is in danger of Kältetod now. 
Among scientists for years mysteriöses provides a phenomenon for confusion - the swing-by-anomalie. 
This is a Flugmanöver Swing-by of Raumsonden, during which they lent a heaven's body in the Gravitationsfeld, around the world. 
By the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The Euro-American Forschungssonde cassini-huygens used these physical trick as well as the Ulysses Sonnensonde. 
What the researchers, however, has for years been surprised: the missiles do not behave totally as one would expect after the ancient Gravitationsgesetz. 
It is irregularities in the speed. 
The probes will speed up or slow down unexpectedly. 
So far this effect could not explain the physicist. 
They swing-by-anomalie tauften him. 
Some experts fear that may even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity seems the attraction of matter by a curvature of the area describes not quite right could be. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle from the Institute for use study from Princeton remains firmly believes that Einstein, and not wrongly tried the swing-by-anomalie through the so-called dark matter to explain the Astronomen accounted for in the universe. 
"responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which is also very near the earth could decide," he says. 
About the existence of the dark matter know the space researchers only for over 10 years. 
It is clearly a magnet for whose effects on other heaven's body is. 
They themselves, however, is totally invisible, that is, it sends out and reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially also no visible light. 
According to the calculations of the scientists makes the dark matter after all good one fifth of the whole mass of the universe.

The idea that the street could buy Avalon Bay was, for the first time during the session this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road while it wants to you, but not necessarily possess. 
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is these dilapidated to renovate alleyway at a public meeting and to make it," said and added that the city itself the sale had proposed. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the department for building protection insisted that it was indeed the desire of the city, the street to sell and stressed that the responsibility of the department is to develop the property rather than to administer. 
Compared with its colourful neighbourhood of the Bowery place extra, has something of his historic impression. 
Some believe that her name in the years the street 1802, as a large farm, owned by Philip Minthorne divided between his numerous children and a close strip of land from anyone was used. 
The back door of the Musikklubs CBGB, the Punkrockdenkmals, which was closed in 2006, opened the extra place and the road is certainly the most known as backdrop for the photograph on the cover of Albums' 'by Ramones to the current long. 
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the managers of the Ramones, of the photograph in November 1976. 
The street was full of scrap metal, shackles and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and Seilen. 
Some residents, einschliesslich of bloggers on the letter of the East village Gentrifizierung, the idea of the sale of extra place, rejected the argument that this public piece of land, however modest as it is to continue to remain in public. 
Others have an extra place than a rarity - a virtually unchanged cluster of the city, should be left in peace. 
Jeremiah died Moss, the blog name 'Jeremiahs verschwindendes New York wants (' 'the book under has the complaints: a bitter nostalgic view of the dying city "), has a part of the discussion of Stadtgeschichte on an extra place, published in the journal," the New York' that appeared in the year 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, said: "an extra place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, even during the day and by verrostete Metalltüre darkness remains the warehouses, closed windows and Regenrinnen wochenalte newspapers is flying over". 
With few exceptions, the street just as recently appeared in one evening. 
A rat ran through the back of the part of the street, not far from the door, the sooner to CBGB, where today a more expensive clothes shop. 
Graffiti on the walls were to see and an empty Bierflasche was on the ground not far from a fresh set of ausrangierten newspapers. 
Some shoppers said they had rarely thought about an extra place, but proposed that the road could be something aufpoliert. 
Fields, added that in his view, some people the attraction of the road in its current state underestimated. 
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places in the dark, damp and disgusting manner. 
Debate on bilingual education education in English language environment. 
In this edition of the "education watch" debate, Bruce Fuller and lance T. Izumi, the positions of the candidates for the bilingual education. 
Lance T. Izumi, senior scientific staff in Kalifonischen studies and senior director in their specialised field education sciences in the Pacific research institute for public policy, is a co-author of the book "not as good as you might think, why the middle class a school selection needs". 
The address Hispanic voters is a complicated task. 
Barrack Obama proposals on the subject of education are a case in point. 
"The Obama campaign said, the likelihood Afro-amerikanischen and Hispanic pupils at the school, a successful conclusion is lower than in white pupils' - and what is true. 
This performance gap to close Bildungsplan specifically from other Obama recommends a bilingual footnote in the training for those who only learn English. 
Still, there is the question to Obama, is whether his commitment to the bilingual training, focused on teaching in languages other than English, his interest is contrary to the distance in the school performance. 
A good example of '' Sixth street "preparatory conference", a primary school in East Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are hispanisch and come from families with low incomes. 
More than a third of students, many of which are just recently in the country, learning English. 
However, in 2008, amazing 100 per cent pupils of the fourth class the State test in Mathe insisted on the right level. 
Also surprising, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English test as well. 
This amazing success was achieved through other methods, than those who are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth street bases its focus to review and exercise at constant control of knowledge and an attitude that no exceptions should be tolerated. 
The school practises in addition to the approach after the training in an English-speaking environment. This is precisely the point that Obama is expected to consider the school leader Linda Mikels. 
This approach stresses the importance of the almost ausschlies in the use of English slichen Fachunterricht. 
Mrs Mikels, rejects the idea zweisprachiger training, said to me, the school would have a remarkable success with a pupil, the only about from Mexico 12 months later. Klassenraum would be to enter and will not be able to see again. 
"It works", realised to you, "it will work for us". 
A school would Obama as the '' Sixth street "preparatory conference" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English students pupils? 
The services of school were the answer to that question lightly, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national Bildunsgvereinigungen support the idea zweisprachiger training for a long time) and his own consistent support of bilingual training to make predictions about Obama answer uncertain. 
While he agrees to the point that immigrants need to learn English, he has trivialized the subject recently when he said that people should stop of concerns about on "only English" gathering legislation. 
Instead, he said: "they should ensure that their child" in Spanish. 
If Obama wants to close the performance gap actually carefully educational models, they should take into account the operation, rather than to trivialize and knock. 
The price of oil is falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy 
The price of oil is on Monday because of fears that even the US rescue plan for the financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy, heavily favours. 
The crude oil futures contracts on the New York trading stock exchange are in the morning session by 7 per cent at 99.80 dollars per barrel. 
Since last Monday, the price of more than $20 per cent. 
In the last two weeks ago, the freight markets by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and of strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico has been shaken. 
After the prices in July peak of $145.29 per barrel, are you in this month to almost $90 per barrel, then fell back, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets to rise. 
Monday, investors already concerned again, although Congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan over the weekend, the largest in the history of should be. 
This news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis is still far from over. 
In the moment last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication, the Citigroup on Monday Wachovia corporation, the banking operations of purchase. 
Meanwhile, Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg governments the European financial company partially nationalised Fortis. 
After analysts when it failed capital - it is despite the tense negotiations, which took place at the weekend and have led to a rescue plan, apparently failed, the mood of the markets to recover. 
As the economic situation deteriorates further, is to be expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts of the German bank, wrote in a note to investors, the forecast for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates are äusserst become uncertain. 
We continue to believe that you write that the goods markets also will be affected. 
"from the perspective of goods markets we are most concerned whether the US American virus spreading throughout the world, particularly after China." 
The analysts of the Bank have their expectations for the oil consumption because of the weak economic growth for the coming year downwards, and their forecasts for the oil and gas prices for the 2009 by 20%. 
Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Innenverteidiger Shaun Ellis thought that he had seen everything after he in the last eight and a half years in camping jets-trikot auflief. 
Then on Sunday he saw the second quarter in which the Jets a ergebnisloses Triumphzug enclosed in a game. 
"this sort of thing I have ever seen," said Ellis. 
After a schlampigem game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals matched the bad weather, began the second quarter. 
However, no passport in Favres Lavernues Quarterback arrived for a 12-yard-touchdown Coles, marked the beginning of a afternoon the perfect blend of their burgeoning cooperation made a giant leap forward. 
Coles Favre found in this quarter for two Touchdowns, this time as a held foreign defender ausrutschte and other times 10 seconds before the end of the mid-term. 
"I am not particularly hard, 'says the Coles on the passes to Coles. 
"He is a Superspieler. 
Our vote has, no matter what the people think. " 
While Favre Coles, played catch and took the defence Quarterback Kurt Warner. 
Außenverteidiger Darrelle Revis started counting from a disastrous exploits and has turned it into a 32-yard-touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a different passport and went away with it. 
Linebacker David Bowen's IRA then for a loss of Warner. 
The last Ballverlust, enforced in Bowen's, was probably the verrückteste. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds left in the game than the Jets conquered the ball back conquered and Jay Feely to a 20 yard shot leadership has turned 34 to 0. 
It was the most points in a quarter of the Jets had ever made. 
When he was asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini said the coach would the Jets' the second quarter or the third quarter? " 
Both on the answer, because the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without a single, Mangini said: "lend me, I have the second quarter longer comrades from the third. 
A lot of points were achieved in a short space of time. " 
Ausgeruhter Gebrselassie is proposing his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia, why it has once again shown some of the best long-distance runner of all time, in Berlin marathon after he broke his own record on Sunday and became the first people, of the journey from 42.2 kilometres in less than two hours and 4 minutes did. 
With the victory on the flat course in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie his previous result of 2: 04: 26 in order to improve 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26 world record in his versatile career in which he sets up on every route from one kilometre until the marathon Weltmeisterschaftstitel reached or at least one set a world record. 
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing, for fear that the hindsight perhaps exaggerated was that the pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead he has registered for the race in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees on goal, Gebrselassie - with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
Since then as Bahnläufer Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat on long-haul from Kenya have changed for marathon, is the record time in the last 10 years, it has fallen by more than 2 minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa, from Brazil in 1998 with the result in Berlin 2: 06: 05. 
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press two weeks ago, he would have had in his Wade Krämpfe and did not train a week. 
He is apparently not to break back eingerostet freshness and relaxation. 
"I am so happy," he said to reporters. 
"everything is perfect. 
I have the training a week ago resumed and still had some concerns, but at the end of what is super. " 
He was criticised in Kenya, Ethiopia - particularly from East Africa rivals - that he too many of his Rennläufe orchestriert weltbeste Marathonstars in general, however, leaves too much on the Rennanführer, as if that would be a Bahnrennen, and world records on the race. 
But this criticism is bad for the size of a long-distance runner Gebrselassies hardly. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans Gebrselassie on Sunday was the centre of the line in 1: 02: 04. 
Two Eliteläufer from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi Gebrselassie have still require after the Tempomacher had subsided. 
A little more than three miles from the Finish Gebrselassie has made his last office in order to separate themselves from Kwambai, the second in 2: 05: 36 arrived and so its Bestzeit has improved by almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi was third in 2: 07: 48. 
Among women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Germany, Kazakhstan and now completed a remarkable year, giving them with 2: 19: 19 of the's seventh quickest results of all time has shown. 
The world record of 2: 15: 25, Paul Radcliff from Great Britain. 
Last spring, the 36 years old Mikitenko surprising the London marathon in 2: 24: 14. 
She has missed the Games in Beijing because of problems which have been described as a back injury. It has, however, recovered, in order to win in Berlin and their Bestzeit, in its third marathon to improve by five minutes. 
She has scheduled its course, cleverly, by a Quartet from Ethiopian and Kenyan Läuferinnen ausreissen, but only after 30 kilometres outdated. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as a third in 2: 25: 01. 
The pride and the strain in the life of the black population, in a city of special kind 
Hidden between the excesses of leisure parks around Orlando, a few miles from the flashy, noisy and towering drive away, is a quiet city in which the pride and the complications of Afro-amerikanischen culture come to light. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the city, Zora Neale Hurstons, is not as simple as Hurston to describe it in 1935: "the city with five lakes, three Krocketplätzen, 300 Brown hides, 300 good Schwimmern Guaven, more than enough, 2 schools and no prison." 
It is nowadays a pilgrimage site. 
Alice Walker, Tony Morrison and ruby Dee, for the annual festival in Eatonville Zora, came at the most famous author of Harlem renaissance memory. 
And still remains the city and the describes it as a Touristenausflugsziel made by including them in the Florida began the tour guide to periods of depression by the Federal writers' project has been produced in many ways a place of particular variety. 
Eatonville is so independent, solid and private as in the 1930s than Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida are often refused to their true ideas to share with the Weissen man, "so little about us knows that he cannot escape what he knows." 
Even nowadays, in a year in which a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, Senator Barack Obama, at an open dialogue on race relations, there are many calls to suffering, of Aussenseitern to be seen. 
"We are very anxious as our history is telling me 'Hortense Jones, 59, from birth, a resident of the town and Community Member of the oldest Church of the city. 
It must vote. " 
Eatonville was a paradox of triumph for a long time, and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement as a community of nearly 2,000 inhabitants, in the poverty levels twice as high as the national average. 
It is a stronghold of the literature and on the other hand an example of the - sometimes sentenced, sometimes touted - black culture of rural south, whose roots lie in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that residents here both proud and at the hat. 
And really began the concerns of Eatonville's image with Zora Hurston, as all of the names. 
It was the world their city, in books by heart, and in Mundart were written, as "Mules and men '' (1953) and" their eyes were watching God (1973). 
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide modified the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the centre of Florida, oft-vergessene leads to the scene of black history and human drama. 
Vehemently as Oskar, both in real life and in the literature, led to the shop by readers of Hurston Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke wrote, and then to privateren affairs. 
"off the roads on the left," wrote it, "is the brown -weiss angestrichene modern school, with its leafy gardens and game creation that always Howard Miller, although he can barely read and write." 
It also mentioned the new man from widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn 'drinks of any kind was-auch-immer and sold to hours of rooms fit. " 
In just a few hundred words expressed so Hurston Eatonville with even government in connection, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
It was certainly not a tour guide. 
In fact, this was not a Portrait, which was estimated by everyone. 
"Zora described the situation as they were in the 90 year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the girls verewigte johnson- Hurston, quoted by the men, who sang songs on their beauty, the full sexual innuendo. 
They added: "some people liked it". 
It is still here as a lively Exzentrikerin Hurtson regelmässig, who returned after their family after Jacksonville, Florida, was drawn. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, reminded that if Hurston gebraust came in the city, they usually without warning, in a noisy, Chevrolet rauchend and with trousers, the suicide today in a city is something at their August Kleidungsstil holds. 
According to Mr Franklin, the majority of people fascinated, though many despise them. 
"The people were always happy to see Zora ', said Mr Franklin. 
But "they remained never too long," he added in his chair while he was added to the back schaukelte, at an altitude of the terrace listening to the Sabelia sea, in the eyes of Hurston in all likelihood was baptised. 
As Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and a copy of their books. 
Together with the majority of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten about it. 
Although it was once a famous author, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black women on Barnard college in the 1920ern, they have been in Fort Pierce, Florida, where they were buried in an anonymous grave. 
In Eatonville, there was no major commemorations, no public readings in high style. 
"I do not think that their contribution in the world, or at least have understood their heritage," Valerie Wrapped Boyd, author of "in Rainbows", a post on Hurston which was published in 2003. 
The turning point came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted a fünfspurige motorway through the city, in order to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the Community. 
Orlandos suburbs already had the motorway 4 through the western outskirts. 
The proposal was put forward as a Eatonville, still of a difficult phase in its history a fortnight. 
Forced integration, among other things, the relatively idyllic isolation of the Community. 
In the 1950s led the fight against racial mixing hatred in the Community. 
"in this time was often a bunch of white boys and they alleged oranges and stuff people who sit on the sidelines," said Mr Franklin. 
"There was even a woman was killed in the process. 
They raised a water melon from the car. " 
Hurston in 1955 behind asked in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel the call of the Supreme Court to force, integration, making its decision in the case of brown as "offensive against the Schulrat respektierend 'instead of my race. 
Inhabitants say today that although the lifting of racial division in some respects was positive, the groups cohesion in Eatonville and self-assurance weakened his young people. 
"black children were used to be, hugged it - I remember - one embraced his teachers in the morning and it embraced his teachers on the evening in N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the not-for-profit group for the protection of Eatonville community. 
It could be maintained for so long, they added, not by teachers and pupils came more from the same place. 
"We embraced his White teachers not, because he was a white teacher - I think there is a cultural divide there," said Mrs Nathiri. 
But the rights of citizens have contributed to the fact that room for further Zora Neale Hurstons has been created - black writers, actors and artists who put themselves through prejudices, as they did with positive self-esteem and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society! 
"I do not understand it. 
In 1975, the novelist Alice Walker on the path to Hurstons nameless grave and started for the revival of their glory. 
Five years later was a lot of Robert e. Hemenway hurston-biographie promised to find shelves in the books, and made it back to a part of the American Literaturkanons. 
The fernstraßen project had just at a time in the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of public opinion. 
And this time they saw as Retterin Hurstons old neighbours. 
The Community began in 1988 with the planning of Hurston festival in order to show what the district with the construction of the highway could destroy. 
Thousands of fans came to the Eröffnungsevent two years later, and every January return many for the celebration. 
Some years later, the district not by its roads. 
"The plans a fünfspurigen Fernstraße crowded the city, accelerated the whole thing with top speed, we were left with genuine," said Mrs Nathiri Bürgerstolz. 
Mrs Boyd put it somewhat easier: '' Zora Eatonville saved. 
The victory against the fernstraßen project prompted a change of the image of the city. 
There were more and more, as Rachelle Zugereiste Munson, a lawyer, here in the Church since 1993, and native started the past. 
Eatonville in 1998, the national historic register. 
A new einstöckige library (of course) opened named after Hurston in 2006 on the neugepflasterten and verschönerten Kennedy boulevard. 
Eatonville, today, it is still a peculiarity in Florida: just 6 miles from the city centre anfühlen Orlandos, it can sometimes feel like a Hintergasse in the summer rains as small as at that time, only 27 of black families in the 1880ern was established. 
(it is currently 90% black.) 
Outsiders in search of the history Eatonvilles and its importance are often still treated with caution. 
For most interviews, the approval in the run-up to necessary and certain things - just as the Wandbemalung of Eatonvilles eldest church which was painted by a Weissen and black men in the toil - should not be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, as Mrs Jones, a bold, confident teacher with a preference for Dunkelrot, still fear that their abgeschirmte Community is misunderstood. 
And yet at the same time to the hurston-festival bigger, was also a greater degree of Heimatstolz was born. 
Young people in particular tend to be regarded as Hurston Eatonville saw their whole race: beautifully, with all its problems, either worse or better, and just as proud, creative and diligent, like any other ridiculous and durchmischt Rassen- and international group in America. 
It is the sincere love for this city in the voice of Mr Franklins, the 18-year-old nephew can hear Edwin Harvey, the plans after the college after Eatonville back, in the town hall or in order to work with the police, according to him, which could use some help. 
And even the younger, as Alondra Kenon and Alexia, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, Eatonville, have learned to describe correctly. 
"the most people, the only here, will think: 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the other," said Alondra Kenon recently after the Church on a Sunday. 
"But if we actually stop and a moment of its history of view it is a very beautiful city." 
Here in New York, it is a financial Latin. 
At first glance nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan by the newspaper stands and the giant television screens in times Square absented themselves, they would not notice that they find themselves in the middle of a debacle. 
You would never think that, on their minds, in the schuhschachtelartigen offices with the Glasfassaden, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter, the monopoly in New York, the worst nightmare day, every day since the 1929 Börsensturz. 
The suppliers blame are still with the metal Teewägen Klappern Tabletts kerb and transport along with Muffins for the breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latin Americans schlurfen still stumbling around between apartment, as human Packtiere loaded with about 50 gebügelten T-shirts on a pile of Joch-ähnlichen ahead on their shoulders. 
People are still waiting to rise to the public on their Frühstücksbagel Essenständen person and it is still impossible in a week is between 16 and 19 p. a yellow taxi. 
It felt totally unacceptable as a crisis until I Thursday afternoon because of all the apocalyptic talk, decided to open a new Sparkonto.

Most before me, I learnt later by rigid, my "personal bankers with licence", were from the same reason as I queue. 
Unlike me, however, they had already removed their savings of smaller banks, in places from where they pendelten, like Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Staten island. 
They had money from so-called Thrifts (a bit of a Bausparkasse ähnelnd), cooperative banks and those local savings banks in only one State subsidiaries have distinguished themselves, and to say that they treat their customers like family. 
In the last year, 15 of those banks shut and quietly gone bankrupt. 
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets of $327 billion, in bankruptcy management on Friday in New York and as a last weekend, went home to cross, was another bank Wachovia, the Sparanlagen in the value of $440 billion, in search of a setting buyers. 
In fear of another collapse, the office of the previous time and Ladenangestellten Bares her to a bank is seen as a safe haven, a bank for most of the rescue takeovers in the Wall Street is responsible.

You were desecrated during law Muslemische graves in Austria. 
Heinz-christian Strache, a left-wing of the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a Member of the Belgian rights Pertei Vlaams Belang, on Thursday, 17 January 2008, in a demonstration in Antwerp part to make the organisation "cities against Islamisation". 
They carry placards in the style of traffic signals in a mosque is contemplated through with a red line. 
The police accused the far right Grabschändung on a Muslim cemetery in Austria, on the same weekend on the far right parties significant gains in the parliamentary elections in the country. 
In the night of the Friday to this morning more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun in Linz in one, according to the police, organized action dearly. 
The perpetrators poured Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but keep it as an attempt to Kriminalbeamte the motive of the hatred of Muslim immigrants victims extremists. 
It is not clear whether the incident in any way in connection with the elections. 
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the Grabschändung, which took place as the religious month Ramadans to the end of Muslim circles. 
At the same time in Austria is a round of conscience, after the country yesterday in the general election he slipped to the right. 
The Freedom Party and the alliance for the future of Austria, the two far right-wing parties, the almost 30% of the vote, got themselves in their campaign with a bare anti-einwanderer law and some of its Wahlsprüche have been criticized by opponents as xenophobic. 
Heinz-christian Strache, leader of the Freedom Party, which won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burkas and even made his aversion to food, which is generally known in conjunction with Islam. 
In his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam. 
Both parties want to the building of mosques and demography brought to ban by the argument that these political symbols of a continuous Islamisation of Austria and Europe. 
Surveys and studies that have been carried out immediately after the election, which suggested that the far right of the politically potent bloc in the country, suggest that this new development based on young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.

The exhibition on the programme of the month, which is one of the photograph of Flamenco 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco by the day to day is increasing, "said of artists and makes clear that' flamenco- people '' any human being can be, but if you look at the photographs, so does the observer that there was no typical images of artists on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portrait are artists, who are capable of on the stage passion, sadness, happiness, and to get to move so that the audience. 
The personality of these artists record, they do not need to photographs on the stage. 
Their personality and character is in their hearts. 
As far as I am interested was to create a personal atmosphere, which would allow me to the people of the biggest Flamenco Fotokamera master it. '' 
Bauer, inspired by the festival '' Minas Cante de las, made in 1997 on a long journey, in order, a singer and dancer at Gitaristen or attempting to photograph with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the Bildsortierungsfunktion of the camera, and the existing material created in images to remind traditional photograph. 
The application of different stylistic resources destroying the traditional base of the image, so that the picture modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands, Flamenco: 'be given music with traditional roots, the changed and surprised every day.' ' 
This is not only the dance, the song or the Instrumentalspiel itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, the audience with its art. 
The search for the essential, after some something that exists in the form of Hörens, the existence is to be visible and was the firm objective of this work in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata is presented. 
Well-known figures in Diego El Cigala Flamenco among them, Lobato Chano, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente crony and others belong to a tight selection of nearly 70 artists who have been photographed. 
The project became one of the Anthologie Flamencos, and it will soon be in book form, with all the portrait from the exhibition. 
Bauer's passion to the portrait, this idea led him to take up to two years ago and as' 'a portrait of veterans of the sport to achieve sportartproject (' '). 
Although the concepts of the project 'flamenco- people are different, the photographer to' it gives me great, people are attempting to photograph, you get to know and to put in their living situation, whether for a brief moment or a longer period of time. 
I think that, in the field of photograph the portrait is the most difficult species. 
Du triffst you or faces of people's personalities, sometimes not at all kennst, or they leave you alone for a few minutes in order to be able to make a photograph. 
In addition to these circumstances as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas. '' 
The collection of the portrait of the Flamencos of today with the title 'flamenco- people' 'is in the gallery of El Fotómata issued in the street, with the name of La Calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition you can visit until 16 October.

The hispanoamerikanische Roman writer admitted that '' there is no way, where one measure and where we know whether books can change the lives of, 'but I refuse to believe that the literature pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience, "said Vargas Llosa, who maintains that it causes effects,' 'and the people even more off each other,' 'why I asked the writers not leave the ease the responsibility' 'and' 'playing for his appeal.

'' Sangre de Mayo with a Filmlänge of more than two and a half hours this Friday in cinemas, will be presented at the station, and later as a vierstündige Telemadrid Miniserie showed. 
José Luis Garci, a fan of literature of Galdós, assured us that this Dreharbeit Kindheitstraum to be '' in fulfilment. That he has the Esperanza Aguirre, thanks to him before three years from the Autonomous Community of Madrid supervisor, a Gedenkfilm Jahrhundertsfeier on 2 November in the second round in Madrid, particularly because the history on the basis of '' Episodios Nacionales is based, the mission.

The Cineast regrets, however, that with the financing, as in '' Alatriste or Los fantasmas de created Goya's' (twice as high as in '' the Sangre de Mayo could not count, therefore, some scenes from the script, with Horacio Valcárcel Garci almost his whole career clock, not cooperated.

Isabel Bayón calls on the memory of the dancers back Tórtola Valencia from Seville. 
A Flamenco dancer from Seville, a dancer, revered as the tribe from Seville. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: your father was a Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusierin Georgina Valenzuela (Valencia), it is in the quarter Triana was born and when she was three years old, is your family moved to London. 
It was a dancer and expert on oriental dances. 
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first supporters of the emancipation of women, as Ducan Isadora, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was, Buddhistin Vegetarierin and campaigned for the abolition of the corset, which reduced the free female movement. 
The lives of these women, their mark in the Tanz- and aesthetic quality revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, has left a trail of faszinierte Isabel Bayón. 
'' I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa me this role and it has proposed, and I thought impossible. ' 
"We are not trying to tell about their lives, special to preserve their Esprit, 'said the Flamenco dancer. 
In Flamenco their Tanzgrundlagen have helped me a lot. 
'' the dance of the butterfly's wings Guajira, for example, as I was, or the snake, '' as the dancing tango. 
It was dance sinnlich and I have been told that my dance in this aesthetic area lies, it claims. 
The orchestration does with two exceptional cooperation: with Miguel Poveda, still time for Isabel in one of their ideas sing, as he is in '' la Puerta abierta has done; and, in flamenco- Coral Matilde, champion of the exceptional together with one of their ex-schülerinnen wanted to work.

The publication of the book 'Diario de UN recién poeta Casado Triennium a including the' 
The presentation of the first magazines edition of "Diario de UN recién poeta Casado 'in the St Stephen's Church (New York), a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez 1916 Zenobia married, offers a similar atmosphere at planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for culture to make the' Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón '(2008).

The United States can hardly imagine without Paul Newman 
'sometimes creates God perfect figures. 
Paul Newman was one of them. ' 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally field, '' with him in Sensationsreporterin worked together, and by the then existing idea of the American cinema, which has been abandoned until Newman of America with its exciting vision, and her followed. 
Show just what it cost to give him the Oscar. 
And when he withdrew in 2007. 
And he knew that he was very ill. 
However, it was a major blow for everyone. 
What a sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and I have lost a great friend, 'said Robert Redford found,' my life and my country were the biggest Drolligkeiten of his life. ' 
No afraid not to make a fool of still too far. 
As' father 'of cinema and the country is he dead in a sad moment, in the fear of terrorists and before the Marktzusammenbruch, peopled by the Dutch beaten self-esteem of Americans on the desperate search for reasons, dignity zurückzuerhalten. 
If this tough time without virtue, only a few people who can admire you, you do not necessarily have Luis Cernuda, Paul Newman. 
For all he represented something of a platonisches ideal of beauty and truth. 
He was official enemy of Richard Nixon and also suffered as a number of losses both profits: from the Foundation, which is committed to the fight against drugs, and in honour of his son from the first marriage, to overdose died, was founded to its own brand internal and organic products. 
This is all a gift for the country, in which it cost him a lot of effort against a deadly food culture. 
A broad wave of surprise is proposing New York on Hollywood regardless of nationalities and nationality. 
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that it is not just one person is dead, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, Filmdirektor and Oscarpreisträger, said that the work with Newman, not more, or nothing less than the tip of his career. 
Russell Crowe, the evil young, who came from Australia, Newman, dared to call as his greatest inspiration. 
'us is the largest of all of us, George Clooney, confirmed to leave, perhaps one of the few today who are trying to make a living trust as Paul Newman lived: high demands on the rectitude, given a responsible private life, far away from the cameras. 
It is not always easy or not even possible in contemporary media jungle. 
But there is someone to try it, and Paul Newman was an example of this. 
He did leave a time and was subsequently married fifty years with Joanne Woodward, which he was true to many opportunities, although it was not to be. 
'Why should I eat a hamburger on the streets, if I have at home, scherzte Filet?' he often itself. 
In the sky, he will be proud that his daughters on the earth, the same view as his supporters will not necessarily in America, as is customary. 
'' of all the major roles he played, he was so proud to not as those of the loyal spouses, of the loving father, of the attentive Opas and those of the philanthropists', they say. 
For the Olympic Games, the road in Madrid flawed. 
Yes, the dream of many of us, some Olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failure to stage for 2012, as it can perhaps 2016. 
But I wonder: '' we are prepared for it? 
Yes, we follow the example of the old road, I would say that it is not true! 
It was described as the perfect street, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with all reason and truth in that, there was. 
Of course, it is a lot of rubbish if the assessment and I would consider it could look at what is clearly not passage. 
But from the start, we go through everything. 
The nonsense begins with the Ticketholen, which allows you to go, as the first. 
It also seems to me to be not bad, but if you act you are, then they should also give you everything (including chip, in order to avoid traffic jams on the street). 
But not so. 
Here let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is to go only then) and (after an endless queues) there is the surprise, the T-shirt there was only in the size '' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL). 
Where we live in fact? 
Or is it so that the next crisis has been decided only small, much cheaper to buy shirts from less substance? 
Well, matters such as this are peanuts compared to the days on the road. 
Apart from the fact that we must go very early in order to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, moreover, it must be the Rucksack. 
The wait has more than 35 minutes, as in the case of a street, where 11 000 people are expected, is incomprehensible. 
Finally, as it was to be expected on the streets, and we had our return bags are not afraid, even if it was even managed to call back but it would be difficult. 
It also saw it, in these 40 minutes after rain waiting for, so it was a popular uprising, the temptation to organise and to invade the Häuschen. 
I think that tomorrow will certainly some 500 people have pneumonia and some as I will be the chip, because of this I received, not even in time for the classification, and I can already think that the outcome wrong has been branded. 
Of course, if you ask me for a perfect road, it would never thought I would. 
I believe, we still have long dream of a city for the Olympic Games is well prepared 
Microsoft in search of a (virtual) Rezeptionistin 
On the '' emerging technology conference, Microsoft veranstalte on the progress of the new images detection system and the interaction between humankind and presented a nature of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, which is capable of some primitive work to do, such as a taxi (or order in the case of Microsoft, this is a routes planners on the campus of the company). The system to get what it considered during the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a violation of form and face distinguishing system Rezeptionistin, this' 'to see how many people in the area are who they are and even recall, as it were, it is the key to listen and understand their entertainment. 
It is also the House following the talks in the groups. 
In the Rezeptionistin Präsentationsvideo noticed '' a third person, but she understands that this person to the group, which is not relevant to their conversation, and that no company employee.

All without the blue Screenshot 
Impressive 
This is certainly the future. 
Now has the company better matters on which it is able to focus, for example, to the next version of its windows operating system. 
We talked this week about the very superficial change of strategy by Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be more quickly and not so many eingebundene programmes. 
Steve Ballmer, noted that if the computer with the necessary, rather than they would be equipped with the commercial waste to fill five times faster, you would function. Man, Steven, that is just for the few. 
Everything is just an observation, given that Microsoft windows versions in one or other function and '' to see. 
The shift is worth 
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is now losing in importance, just like the software. 
As Google chromium in the network appeared, it was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google, in order to compete with windows. 
Were sent to point out that the browser is not operating system. 
The operating system, as an indispensable part will always be needed to ensure that the hardware and software at the same time can function. 
The operating system meets the role with the function of his wife or his or her husband comparison can be made when it comes to his mother-in-law something to say. 
This is true. 
The system will never disappear, but must be made to his death '', not as an absolute, but rather as a relative truth, thinking. 
What Ballmer, said this week, is the affirmation of this idea. 
The people pay less attention every time the operating system, more the web-browser. 
The computer will only be initiated the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium to implement and every day that we spend more time on surfing, than in the surroundings of the 'window'. 
What serves half in the computer of existing applications? 
Less is more " 
And windows 7 is more compact, much more compact than vista. 
Easier, not so excessive, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft's, there is more to integrate its online services, finally the alternative to Google. 
In reality you need it, no doubt about it. I am a small example. 
The photograph of this place I have in Redmond, in one of the recreational spaces for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
In the soft drinks dispenser is a shield securely fixed: '' your search. Our future. It prints a request from our own tool to use for online-suche. 
In 2006, an independent study concludes that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google for the research used on the network. 
Incidentally, last week, also confirmed that the new version of the windows mobile 7 in the delay. 
She will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, more even 2010. 
Microsoft seeks the possibility, windows 7 and windows mobile 7 at the same time on the mark. 
The telephone every day turns into a computer. 
The Android and the iphon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso in Costa angehabt Azul, Leonardo di Caprio, this brand in 'blood diamond' by Edward Zwick, in the same way Al Pacino in '' the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it is part of clothing for a well built pastor.

'' la Marcel überragt, all because of its excellent cotton, because of his under outgoing unisex-schnittes and is marked by a small Belgian flag (barely recognisable) from the T-shirts as a detail on Halsausschnitt. 
And respect, the Belgian company is focused not only on the production of '' tanks. 
They also have college Sweatshirts, them Retro, and Kaschmire Cardigans, from cotton trousers, t-shirts with strip, babies, mini shorts 
Modellierte and comfortable in linen. 
Although, it is very sad to use them as under clothing. 
They are very attractive.

Like I go through a city and observing women as they are occupied, as you combine their items of clothing, I do so often. 
Dancer, actress and Modedesignerin, you are a very different women, not true? 
I think so, but finally, is everything in one and these areas have many similarities. 
Since I was by the clothes, I was always excited; I wanted to go to my grandmother in the outer limit my aunt herumzuwühlen and their clothes. 
It was superb, almost better than in a Freizeitpark to go. 
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to respect to the clothing.

She asked me to the parade for this großherzige thing, but if you ask me, and to make a Handstand, I will do so. 
The women in the developing world to support what is necessary. 
The motorists about the alcohol levels can be Alcolock will need to install the ''. 
The authority instructions that the driver of the three official penalties because of the alcohol levels in his car had installed the system, which prohibits him in the state of drunk to start the car. If he bounces drink-drivers, then the vehicle is not. 
The initiative has already been last month announced in June and already a part of the report, the Generalstaatsanwaltschaf. After their information is a piloten- project, which will take a year. 
The purpose is the rehabilitation of the driver, so why this one course of action for the re-education of transport behaviour. 
In addition to the general public prosecutor's office, from experience, will take the Transport Ministry and the foundation of the technical Institute for security of cars. 
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists, the more than once for driving under the influence of alcohol once notified of taxpayers. 
The '' that would prevent Alcolock, because it is a system is working with the car it attaches to the alcohol content in the ausgeatmeten Autostart air and prevents screening when the driver has made; or if a alcohol concentration is found, the higher than is allowed. 
It costs more than 1000 euro, the cost will be borne by the sanction imposed. 
In this context, a study in the United States, which was carried out in 2007, showed that with these devices equipped cars in the first year after its introduction by 65% of the rule violations. 
In Spain it is estimated that each year, 115 lives could be saved. 
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: this behaviour to tackle werd before it becomes a criminal offence. 
And their implementation in order to facilitate lawful, a law reform can be implemented on the ordinary ways, and yet it is a reform of the Constitution calls for the law enforcement process is necessary.

1001 Council against stress 
There are not 1000, but a possibility of everyday life, so chaotic us fast to forget. 
Although few are all collected in a book, in which it is how to defuse the book comes in the bookshops on 30 September. 
The Wecker, if it is a penalty by 7 a. m. rings, but even worse, the idea that again in the flurry of rhythm, which requires the current life, reinzukommen. 
The Office means the tension and the computer, which lead to the back pain. 
The stress is the evil of the 21st century. 
But there are not one and not two methods, about the everyday exhaustion and the problems, such as one of the world of work abschaltet. 
But the figure is rising, not more, not less than by 1001. 
In addition, the traditional massage or yoga-stellungen Susannah spa-behandlungen Marriott in the book, is the whole list of possibilities in the taste and time each suited. 
The work against the stress means' '1001 opportunities to deescalate and so, the calm, what the book conveys the publishing house in the bookshops and Pearson Alhambra DK. 
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to the calm in the areas such as work with the help of personal contacts to achieve this manual, so refuted this faith. 
There will also be offered the methods, as one remains in contact with nature or the 100% natural remedies, the proposed to relieve. 
If the adrenalin in your Venen hochsteigt not more in order to restore balance of the body and stress is becoming a problem as the time has come hinzusetzen Sofa, again, the brain shutting down and to focus on the read. 
In the sleep talking 
Some children speak at night 
I think not those who wake up and tell us something, what happened the day before, but the children during sleep. 
If it is happening for the first time you, in the best case scenario would be shocked, but in reality, not the importance. 
This is a positive sleep disturbance, the talk is called in their sleep. 
It is quite common, especially among children and young people. 
Of course, it has more than one of you told us that they have spoken at night. 
This phenomenon can occur from time to time (a time in life, for example, such as during the high fever), or regularly (each day, a time per week, once a month), the next day the child can remind you of anything. 
There is no single reason of this phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena, such as nightmares looking in their sleep at night, petrified at night, Enuresis Bettnässen noctura (talk), sought in their sleep, but there is no reason to do so. 
As we have mentioned earlier, it can in a very high Fiber, stress situations or asking too much. 
In any event, this is a little erforschtes phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it occurs, is very modulated. 
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, flüstert or it can be quite a opposite (cries, wines, long discussions). 
In cases when the expression is very hard, recommends the child to observe and take part in a specialists to discuss to check whether a problem which is causing fear and in this way. 
We have said that there is a positive disruption, it will therefore not dealt with it, whether it is associated with a different sleep disorder, which can be dealt with (for example, with the schlaf-apnoe or with the stress). 
What can be done, is a series of simple preventative measures. 
The child before trying not to burn the sleep. 
So calm game for the baby stressige television programmes and choose to avoid the terrible and rather too wild. 
In the nervous children, which Entspannungen recommends relaxation methods can be used to help them to get a certain home calm. 
That will help calm the baby to sleep. 
If it happens again in their sleep, talk is trying to remain calm. 
Thinks that the baby and the next day is harmless, it will not be able to recall what happened. 
Useful advice 
It is not on Weck. 
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, as will you pull it from the sleep. 
Although the child speaks, it is asleep in bed, so she earns. 
Remember, if it is after a couple of phenomena demonstrates, scared, so it is recommended to discuss or to find out why the child for the fear. 
If you understand what it says (and not so usually is), the child under pressure not to hold a hearing in order to discover and more information. 
So you can achieve it with nothing, because if the child is sleeping, it is unconscious and think about it. 
In addition, man will hear what it says, but it will not know what it is and why it says, so you have to be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions, which draws her. 
Perhaps not the child, it says, that her the night and hear his secrets. 
Not even as a joke. 
It is causing a lot of fear. 
So, get down not to worry, there is no bad thing, this is a moment, only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhäusern... 
After a long drought is Illhäusern on the pitch finally forging ahead again. 
Without much effort on the part of the gelb-schwarzen erspielten Torchancen and removed a number to implement it, one of them, and so the game to win. 
The pace of this encounter, in which the attacker had bothered to demonstrate their skills, was not very high. 
After a first attack of the Gastkapitäns Kauffmann, whose Fernschuss, at the corner escaping with ease Illhäusern should dominate the game, and it was only with a rotational basis Fonderflick Fernschuss, then with a brain Hochpass Romain, and with a shot with the Fußspitze challenge the defence of Denmark. 
The opposing team in the Feldmitte blockte Riahi and left only the bustling at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive, and with two by Riahi Torchancen Temporale won, and afterwards immediately with the first gateway for the Illhäuser by Marais, exactly the right thing to do was to adopt a ball in a first attempt by Diebold was repelled. 
But the illhäusische Torschütze should be able to enjoy his luck not long and almost 12 minutes later to be sent to the Bank, increasing its figures continue to inferior team comrades had to play. 
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of a illhaeusischen eleven and found no major problems, only a little withdrew their defence, in order to '' gathering, except in the final seconds of the game, in which the ball after a great confusion escaping very close to the bar.

Obama, winner after points in the first Fernsehduell 
At the first debate of the two candidates for the White House Friday followed a further to find out who emerged as the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama. 
As expected, the qgs announced the election of both the Republicans and the Democrats their own victory in this Fernsehduell, that of a third of American families should be taken. 
The political analyst David Gergen has estimated that John McCain's performance, although not quite substantial, was sufficiently '' brilliant in order to enable it to his decline in Wahlumfragen five weeks before the presidential elections or to stop. 
The Gallup, of the Institute of an opinion poll published on Saturday that Obama was ahead lies with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the view that the Democrat clearly the better figure. 
In the undecided voters, which, on which it is needed, was Obama with 39% as the winner in the polls, whereas according to a cbs-umfrage 25% of you see McCain as the victor. 
Obama should its lead on Thursday with the good performance by his competitors in Joseph Biden first and only public debate with his Rivalin Sarah Palin, is expected to be able to confirm 
"it would be wrong to underestimate them. 
It has good instincts, but warned this weekend to Bill Clinton. 
The 70-year McCain not heard on his undoubted experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, and this very clearly the 'naivety' of his adversary to stress on these issues, which formed the heart of this first Fernsehduells. 
'Senator Obama does not seem to understand that he emphasised the...', several times. 
"I do not believe that Senator Obama on the necessary experience and the knowledge, in order to become President ', assured he also. 
A target, since yesterday in the Republican Wahlwerbespots preaching. 
Obama himself has said that he represents the future. 
He spoke briefly and precise, without bringing from the version. 
He got his ability in the foreground, good decisions and the image the world of the United States, to renew. 
'McCain has still not understand Obama' already this weekend, set against a democratic Wahlwerbespot was accused in the Republicans, not the full extent of the crisis to have covered at the '' Americans off the streets. 
During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about it, has denounced Obama yesterday before 20,000 people to the opportunity in an electoral meeting gathered in strömendem nord-carolina rain. 
He mentioned not even the words' middle class' or 'workers' '. The financial crisis gives Obama, the best of the Americans to keep the economy, even on the edge of the precipice to rescue a clear advantage. 
'' the next week could lead to a decisive turning point ', yesterday estimated the influential democratic Senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative Rahm Emmanuel, a former Member of the Clinton administration, likened the good economic instincts' 'Obama with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998. 
For the Democratic candidate is the current crisis' the final ruling of an eight-year-old bad economic policies of George Bush and implemented by Senator McCain has been supported. '' 
After he had stressed that he is probably even, would create the taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations in the Wall Street to reduce, warned the Senator from Illinois to point out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and promoting renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, a top priority for him. 
McCain against a plant by 2030, wanted to build from 45 nuclear power plants. 
The two candidates silently leap to the issues on the plan to rescue the financial market about 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people. 
'' have you noticed that an election took place in Minsk? ' 
Young people and opposition marched Sunday night on the capital of Belarus Hauptplatz, in advance to reject the results of the parliamentary elections. 
A few hundred Belarussians, gathered Sunday evening for closure of polling stations in the market square of Minsk, in order to combat the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections to protest. 
Although no result was announced, so many young people have come against the power of Alexander Lukachenko to demonstrate: '' the dictator should resign. 
Some admit that they have not even elected: 'What is the point, if you with my vote but always do what they want,' says a young people. 
They do not believe that the regime, which is the foreign observers in the best light has shown that the negotiations with the European Union, is willing to resume a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the floor of visas for 40 leading Belarussian personalities and the Aufeislegen certain assets, could be lifted if these elections from the observers evaluated as a clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not. 
"We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to take part in the count, he regretted Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the Union of democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of 12 parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, said Alexander Milinkevich, a former opposition candidate for the presidential elections in 2006 and leader of the pro-europa-bewegung, because it is important to know who the voices auszählt, and in us, it is the executive. 
If Members of the opposition in Parliament, then vacated because they were appointed, not elected. 
But she joined Parliament can air time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals mean. ' 
The opposition is, therefore, guilty of interference in the political game, because 'the dialogue with the European Union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia in a crisis and we are not reform, we run the risk of a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we want to be independent. '' 
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the voting process, the choice is not as valid. 
She points out that the wahlbeteiligungs figures seem too high, and that the extension of the voting in advance (26% of the electorate of Minsk) the way for any kind of manipulation has paved. 
"they have noted that there has been an election? asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners have been released in August of this year. 
In the polling stations was nobody. 
And it will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, and the ones who are most likely to meet the ideas of the government. ' 
The silence of the night, cut back across the Oktoberplatz. 
President Lukachenko congratulate on television and the members of the Central Election Commission to their success. 
Meeting - from the blood that, once, of course, was 
Hema-quebec yesterday was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its President, Dr Mrs Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because hema-quebec is one of the safest and most effective blood banks of the world. 
And, above all, it has gained the confidence of the public by the scandal by the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s, was considerably shaken. 
As we know, were the donated blood service of the Canadian Red Cross national Blutreserven administered during the 1980s with HIV and Hepatitis c-virus contaminated. 
In light of this drama and the public discontent led the Canadian government in February 1994, a public, by the judge Horace Krever mounted an investigation, it aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy, and directives for a new disaster to prevent this type. 
While judge Krever, his report still hesitated to make several provinces at the time, asked a Committee on the legs, whose aim was to a new system for managing blood to develop in Canada. 
The Committee met in Quebec Gélineau this mission. 
After the reports of Gélineau Krever, and two blood banks: founded in Canada for hema-quebec Quebec is responsible, and the Canadian Blutgesellschaft, about the other provinces and the two territories. 
Hema-quebec '1998, their work has included 38% of the people had very little faith in the blood system in Quebec, remembers Dr Décary. 
The situation was dispiriting. 
By the enormous efforts in order to improve the safety of the blood and through the work in this area during the next year, we have won the confidence of the public, it says, before you proud stressed that the beginning of 2008 now almost 94% of the population hema-quebec had confidence in Quebec. 
However, Dr Décary 'confidence in the knowledge that something is extremely fragile.' ' 
Since its creation on 28 September 1998 hema-quebec is following the principle of caution. 
At this time, we saw the emergence of numerous cases of the human form of mad cow disease in Europe with a new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, told this woman since the creation of 1998, which holds the leadership. 
'' and we have not had the slightest idea whether this disease could be transmitted by blood. 
So we invoked one of the main directives of the reports and Gélineau Krever, according to one exclusion measures, if we did not know and if a disease only slowly, as it seems, in the case of the disease is caused by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death. 
In April 1999, so it was no blood of people who are since 1980, more than a month in the United Kingdom had stopped. 
Now, a few years ago, without any doubt, demonstrated that the disease transmitted by blood. 
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we, the sense of rigid. 
In 1999 on the market seemed a much more precise technology to detect HIV: the nukleinsäure-tests (NST), which will make it directly in the blood of the donor to prove the existence of the virus itself, and it is not the antibodies against the virus, like the hitherto tests of the case. 
The NST enabled to shorten the incubation period, between the time the person was infected and, if the first viruses through our techniques can be found in the blood, states the specialist, is taking place. 
This time, to a period of less than a week will be reduced. 
It was the risk that some donors could be infected without knowing it, and we could not see substantially reduced. 
These improvements enabled, the risk of AIDS through a blood transfusion, to a considerable extent to transfer to lower them. 
Today there is a risk of 12 million people with HIV infected blood. 
"in other words, that means that we should distribute 12 million blood before someone infected with HIV. 
As hema-quebec every year between 400 and 500 000 blood, I would be distributed more than 24 years before a case in which HIV acts on a Blutkonserve. 
I believe that we are now in the process, if you can feel comfortable receiving a blood transfusion or wants to restore the health ', says the head of direktions by hema-quebec. 
'' our challenge for the next 10 years, the safety of our products. 
One never knows what pathogens can reach into the system. 
Only last year at the reunion is the appeared, the chikungunya-virus, just as the westnil-virus, by insects on the blood is transferred. 
We must monitor driving continuously, Dr Décary continued, before she points out that hema-quebec alongside a safe supply in addition to provide an adequate supply. 
"The demand is rising, because the population is getting older. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive cancer patients often need or new red blood cells, platelets. 
The ageing population also has an impact on the Blutspendernetz, to an average of only 3% of the donations appropriate natives of Quebec. ' 
It is every healthy man, the 18 years or older, and the eligibility criteria are met, all 56 days, six times a year, blood donations. 
On average 14% of the people who their blood available, not accepted because they, for example, of AIDS or malaria, and anyone who has travelled in a country where malaria is endemic, will be excluded from the donations for a year. 
'with these 3% we make it an inventory to that meets the needs of the hospitals. 
A lack of stockpiles are very rare. 
But we must renew the members of the donor network, as they grow older and no blood more donations. 
It is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all, to keep them and encourage them to make regular donors. 
The life today is so hectic that it is seldom finds the time to spend an hour in the blood, '' Mrs Francine Décary regrets. 
With an annual budget of $297 million hema-quebec provides not only blood, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, Augäpfel and skin, almost exclusively with serious fire violations is used. 
These tissues are frozen, processed and investigated before they can be stored with hema-quebec, which is also the only public umbilical cord blood bank Quebec managed. 
In the umbilical cord that previously had been seen as a biomedical waste, is also on stem cells rich blood which could help serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to deal with.

Charest is relying on the North 
The Prime Minister does not rule out elections before the end of the year. 
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was out, travelled yesterday after Jean Charest jean-talon in Quebec, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying, in today's Teilwahl to be elected. 
"the course of our last great northern borders' delay: this is the long-term goal that Jean Charest yesterday with visual funds in the General Assembly of the Liberal Party Levis introduced in Quebec, and he was followed by the guidelines.. 
During his lecture behind him was a kind of images being projected mill. 
On three giant screens were spectacular images of water power stations, mines, from Quebec in 'Google MGP maps,' Look, etc. 
How large funds during the legislature. 
In the newspapers refused to rule out the Prime Minister, incidentally, that he will prevent the elections this autumn, even if he implied that his diary was very full. 
The North '' plan is the fourth element of a 'vision', the Prime Minister has allegedly for Quebec, namely a 'new economic area, an agreement with France regarding labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Although they frequently in the last time in the speeches of the Prime Minister said, was the opening of the north - the northern territory on the 49sten latitude - have never been the subject of a presentation. 
The Prime Minister was limited, however, point to explain why the North 'a jewel with enormous potential' is not a date, but she did not have investment amounts, or exact priorities for the next projects. 
A maximum of some looking to what could be more work, especially on the water energy, on wood, but especially in the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of emerging economies and the renewal of the public infrastructure. 
Mr Charests, according to the list, the North 'nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.' ' 
This' area twice as big as France 'is close at hand, is in Quebec. 
It is not just close to us, it is in us', he emphasised, as in order to clearly show that he is seeking to achieve a national Gründertraum. 
Quebec is very through his association with the North has grown, he emphasised: the road to gold in the technology, Abitibi Quebec, the james-bucht. 
"It belongs to us, it is our future, he added, after he had appealed against a but dramatic break with the huge card behind it. 
The North, 70% of the area of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador, the Quebec have always tripped, said the Prime Minister in the press. 
This is a traditional position that all governments. 
There is a fault line on which it for a very long time is no agreement if the opportunity, I will play in the name of the government ', he said. 
In addition, 'with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North', said he and talked about the north-west passage on the basis of the whole year Eisschmelze befahrbar. 
In this new geopolitical context does the Prime Minister, that there was nothing short of a duty to occupy the area. 
And the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous people and the Inuit? 
The Prime Minister said that the government Quebec would be very careful to deal with you, and that they would benefit from the project, especially the young. 
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former MP pekistischer Ungava) have already begun deliberations in about 30 communities. 
A ministerial committee managed by Benoît Pelletier, Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) has an important role to play, did the work. 
The Prime Minister does not lose a Grand Assembly, "is not a summit, but an opportunity, '' we will create a common vision. '' 
The development of the North is, in fact, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. 
The plan discussed North will '' to be regulated and environmentally friendly, he promised. 
Jean Charest described this' vision ', as if they were a continuation of the Liberal Prime Minister, was before him were in office. 
'' as the Liberals who were in office before us, we have to turn that around the challenges in new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
That was, in fact, one of the repeatedly issues raised by the weekend, with a large Cocktailparty on Friday to mark the 50th anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership was opened by Jean Lesage. 
One of the decisions adopted by the power station, in adélard-godbout-staudamm Beauharnois renamed. 
'hydro-quebec Godbout, which has produced about Lesage, the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of the water electricity has achieved james-bucht Bourassa, which has made our party always knew, to determine the future', said Jean Charest. 
In the press, he did to another conservative projects, and this time on the programme Roads to the north '' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 until 1963. 
In relation to the hydroelectric dam project eastmain1a-ruper, Mr Charest, whose entry into service was scheduled for 2012. 
"It remains among us, but I plan to be in his party, familiar members, which has generated storms on those plaudits. 
The Prime Minister, in April 2008, it said, and also, of course, there would be no elections in 2009, does indeed have the opportunity to hold an election this autumn, and he is possible in terms of the law, not yet excluded. 
He emphasized, however, that his diary full, mainly because of a mission of the Gemeinschaftsrats in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The General Assembly introduced by the weekend, the Liberals, a party leader a platform from nationalist plans, particularly from '' the Constitution aims in question, the readily adopted: the PLQ particularly demanding the recognition of Quebec '' feature in the Constitution. 
They would also like to members of the Council that Quebec, the Canadian broadcasting and telephony, and that they should appoint a veto on the decisions in Quebec. 
By the opposition, the guidelines of the plan included North with scepticism. 
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, the policy on the development of the resurgence nord-du-quebec Landry, the government has introduced in 2001. 
According to her, the Liberal Government in 2003, when they came to power, decided not to use them. 
If they had done we would be today, '' a lot further on Mrs Marois, ruled on the side of their candidate in jean-talon (where the election takes place today) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ has called the adoption of a plan to support the north by the government. 
'' but what we want is that this is not only a great idea ", said the party leader in Proulx Sébastien representation for Mario Dumont, the today comes back from holiday. 
Letter - a entehrtes country 
Mr Vic Toews, '' justice exported (how ironic) -minister of the cabinet Harper was the last summer about Louise Arbour, allowed to say that it is a '' outrageous for Canada. 
This woman, an interminable struggle for justice has produced, and deserves all our admiration, so with outrage on cigarette packs, says as much about the people from around the Prime Minister, as on Stephen Parker itself. 
We are dealing with a government, as the only for all the affected countries to their Guantanamo prisoners in concentration camps not countryman has taken home. 
A government that not even into account that Omar Khadr was still a young man who crossed the things, which he accused of. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaking its word and a child soldier to languish under inhuman conditions. 
The only one who is on a justice parody herablässt in order to assess the fault of the defendants. 
We should remember that, especially UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers argue, Omar Khadr to bring home so that he gets a fair trial in Canada. 
This is exactly the government also closes its eyes to the torture: they are more interested in little that a young adults after so many years of an ordeal will for ever be mentally broken. 
We are not yet aware, but we are seeing here is the insidious curtailment of our rights, our freedom and our '' democracy Harper, this word, which constantly as a flag, and that from his mouth sounds so noncommittal. 
It is therefore the time has come, where there could be no morality is no longer a Canadian citizens, we can arbitrarily imprison, torture and abuse, quite as they see fit of a government until today, which is supported only by the minority (let him after the 14 October are quite on the minority...). 
Many voters believe that their salvation in a party to find the champions virtue, law and order. But they do not see that this government is broken by the what the reputation and represented the dignity of our country. 
The disgrace, Mr Toews, lies in this Lossagung, and nowhere else. 
Free opinion - the Orwellian talk of Barrick gold 
In its edition of 17 September Le Devoir published a letter from Mr Patrick J. Garver, vize-generaldirektor Barrick gold of the Canadian gold mine. 
This confirms this, and followed an Orwellian logic that the biggest goldgewinnungs society in the world a libel case on six million against three authors and a small mittelloses Publications Service sought, with the goal of being a '' to open public debate. 
If it is true that the judges independent and impartial judgments, then you are not on the truth, especially not in the case of smear lament, but about the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver. 
Because of Barrick gold is the best way to conduct a public debate, everyone in the business who dares to drive, one of the their opposite view. 
No matter how the process, the authors and the editor of the book States Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and with very unequal arms against an army of lawyers to fight the from the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine are paid. 
The tactics in this unequal fight is in fact often, the defenders to ruin an amicable settlement in order to force the opposing side to silence the power and furthermore who dares to dissuade again at the question. 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public debate, she would have their view of things must present in the face of public opinion. 
Contrary to what many of the countries in which works, Barrick gold, are usually in Canada debates by the exchange of ideas and not by Knüppelhiebe. 
This could have been enough unless the gold mine their books and files to the table and a real debate would have opened up by the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent Prüfteams, would have the light on this issue. 
But Barrick gold seems no confidence in the public opinion aside, and to the petitions and letters in support of the authors from States Canada with a snap of his fingers to one side. 
Could perhaps Mr Garver explain how he make an 'public' debate but can ask the opinions of the same public contempt? 
Apparently includes the word in the world of Vice-President just the generous paid lawyers, and not the Community of Canadians; a very nice beengte view of the concept. 
In a democracy of the detractors have the right to speak. 
Does not understand what Barrick gold - or do not want to understand - is that the public, the authors and publishers of States, Canada supports doing it, particularly because they opposed the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
This public is prepared to do so, Barrick listen and to judge, but on the basis of a civilised exchange of arguments, and not in a framework, whom many perceive as knebel-klage (in the course of the '' public debate Barrick gold has just made a call to the authors from States Canada, in which she asked of them not to use the term...). 
In addition to the surreal speech by Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct assault on the freedom to academic research and the truth, it is an essential component of any democratic society. 
It denies absolutely the right to quote from credible sources and about facts and interpretations to discuss, form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it in a country like Canada is impossible to investigate and issues to discuss, the rich companies of this world, who else will be able to do? 
If Barrick gold really wanted to a public and open debate, could lead them by the scientific standards, the authors of States Canada have been used. 
She has a right to reply. 
The university environment to which we belong, White for a long time, debates and disagreements over control and to resolve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what they claim, no desire to a transparent debate. 
This is a loss for the Universitätswelt, as well as for public debate, and it is time for the governments to take action to limit this type of unwarranted lawsuits. 
Wall Street rescue operation for the Democrats and Republicans understand themselves. 
The management of Bush and the senior Congress, Republicans and democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan about 700 billion dollars, which is to stop the financial crisis, which has for months, the Wall Street shaken by the two must still be approved chambers of Congress. 
The main contents are: a better control of the Members on the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms for the repayment of the public money, new orders, to secure because of the number of payment arrears gepfändeten houses, as well as the right to stem to monitor the salaries to the senior executives of the companies supported paid. 
The U. S. Financial Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and in the negotiations representative of the Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, proclaimed yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon. 
"We have made great progress towards an agreement, which will be marktwirksam ', said the representatives of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
'' it was all in the real economy and the American people before the Kurskrise on Wall Street to defend, said the Democrat. 
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not, the trauma, the chaos and the unrest in the daily lives of Americans be enormous', said the Republicans Judd Gregg. 
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, for fear of the impact that another failure on the mood of the investors have had. 
The deadline, which had been agreed was the Markteröffnung this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates, the only late in the negotiations were involved, rather than supporters of the agreement, but without to miss to express their dissatisfaction that they must take to these extreme way. 
The democratic Senator Barrack Obama was on the addition of certain orders for agreement, especially those that should enable it to the owners to keep their homes, and such, the salaries of senior executives of the state Geretteten enterprises. 
The taxpayers' 'if you asking because of the irresponsibility of certain people to take extraordinary measures, that is not what we could congratulate themselves. 
But these measures are necessary, '' he told on American television channels. 
On another channel when he was asked whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: "I would like to only know the details, but I hope it. 
"The phrases that I have read [show] that this is a matter that we will all have to digest, and we will be able to continue. 
The option to do nothing, is simply not acceptable, 'he said. 
The 700 billion, dollar-plan is aligned with the taxpayers' money 
He is 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble, the first of the collapse of the risky mortgage loans (Subprime), before they are recently taken steps towards loans to other forms verbreiteterer (PCAA), and, finally, in a freezing the financial strength and in the ruin of banks and financial institutions. 
It was a group of Republican Member of the last week, the first attempt failed to reach an agreement. 
Since the Democrats have accepted that some 'toxic' assets of the companies in trouble only guaranteed by the government and not to be bought, people think the impasse. 
At the point of view for all matters in Congress, has also been added a disposal, which says that if the government with this programme within five years, then they should make losses could impose new taxes to invest their capital. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to another 100 billion if President can be added there is a need. 
The extra 350 billion in a repeat vote must be approved by Congress. 
In return for its aid Washington shares in the company, which supported him in the case of profits dividends, and the table can sell it again, if the storm is over. 
The federal government, which will have the opportunity pfändungs procedure with the homes are affected by this plan in the property loans are tied to halt deadlines, and also for the repayment and set the pay compensation to the senior executives of the companies affected will be paid. 
The developers of the plan would like to have that the Chamber of Deputies already votes on it, and then the Senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all its efforts, is still not certain that their plan will be given the green light. 
More votes actually rose up against this idea yesterday, both from the Republicans and the democrats. 
Washington '' obviously understands us not ', said the Republicans Scott Garett, a Member of the financial Commission of the Chamber, his constituents. 
'' Yes, we have a big financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not the, which is to ask the taxpayers to pay. '' 
The democratic Member Brad Sherman, the head of a group in Congress, the '' of the sceptics of Kaukus things is known, is different, but to the same conclusion. 
'four hundred excellent economic professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to tell us that we are not going to ask the Congressional pressure and think carefully about what path is,' 'he said yesterday. 
At the same time, we were again in Europe to prove that it is a global crisis. 
In an emergency assembly announced the three Benelux countries the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars). 
The intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that they would refrain from buying their Konkurrentin, which is in big trouble, since they 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate loans in the United States has lost. 
Fortis, 85 000 persons employed and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
"This is not a wasted money, said yesterday of the Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
To compensate, we have a right to vote and influence in the Bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and budgets, now announce as uncertain times. ' 
During that time, it was on the other side of the channel in the middle of the British Government, another of the financial crisis to nationalise the Bank in trouble. 
According to the English press the government would all current loans to the Bank Bradford and Bringley, more than 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate loans. 
The Spanish Bank Santander yesterday that they were aware of the branches and customers would buy up the British bank accounts. 
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, the British Government nationalising since the beginning of this financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of a dedicated icon 
His beauty with the azurblauen eyes was for a long time asset, no one would say its weakness. 
, the American actor with the charming smile liberated by the narcissistic mirror? 
Yes and no. 
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent, it will also kept away from a position of power, the truly dreadful monster to the world. 
But what a great duration runner! 
The on Friday at the age of 83 years in the consequences of lung cancer at his Ranch in Connecticut of deceased Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of American cinema of his golden years. 
He was less than monumental Brando, which he resembled it for a long time, and for a kind of rival on the canvas, was careful in his spectacle is certainly even more fragile, but as an apostle of freedom and the Sprengens dramaturgischer conventions. 
Vermischtes blood is often wonderful children. 
He was in 1925 in Ohio as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian Indian mother was born. 
From its European roots, one of the otherwise illustrious faces of the American dream. 
Without excessive egos, utmost quality feature. 
Because it was reflected an entire country back in the Self-made-man was love in the combatants in the war of the Pacific in the shoot-out, was injured in the early 1950s Schauspielkunst studied at Yale, and then the Actor's studio in New York, before he visited success on theatre, on television and, soon, in cinema. 
The same man who fought for civil rights, was also the driver of the 1979 the 24-hour race Mans second, and also a Sexsymbol, although he, along with the actress Joanne Woodward Vorzeigebeziehung lived in a since 1958. 
With him disappear and the unknown facets of this arcane, modest, committed and the glamour of the branch of show allergic stars, which will solve one mystery never completely. 
A decent man, described as sense of the word. 
The death of Paul Newman's left the this weekend in Kinoliebhaber clambered, while on the dark screen of memories all its major roles were gone. 
More than half a century of American film draws in constant change with him over. 
Since getting back the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid memories" (1969), and the young man, his sinnliche Mrs (Elizabeth Taylor) in the cat in the hot Blechdach rejects by Tennessee Williams, which was filmed in 1958. 
There will be a much shorter recent memory (1990), out of his sensitive Mr bridge, in his old age is disrupted by a wedding, not all of their promises. 
So many other Paul Newman's were in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable of them from Rocky Graziano Somebody up there Likes me (a handful of dirt) by Robert wise, a role which was intended for James Dean, after its death resumed and the Newman made right known in 1956. 
This pleasant crook in the supreme the Sting (the Clou), the 1973 with the Oscar for best film was excellent. 
As verbitterter and vengeful playing "ping pong 'players of the wonderful the Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), 
That face throughout by the times, that was it. 
He still. 
In his CV clubs are eras. 
The Youth knows him, mostly from the Kultfilm Slap Shot by George Roy hill (1977), as Reggie example, Dunlop, the little Orthodox coach of a Eishockeyteams. 
It did his fans in 1994 in the Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen again. 
With a final role in 2003 as a godfather of the Irish mafia in road to Perdition by Sam Mendes echoed the circle. 
Unlike several Kinolegenden, which soon enough have withdrawn from the Filmwelt Newman, should remain in place for a long time, and in Hollywood, his assets, its Prunk and his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humour, as living challenge to the '', as he Underplaying the strength of the services indicated would too. 
The preserve was not always easy for the fine Paul Newman, the only way the roles for a long time zuflogen. 
But he played: Neurotiker rare Sunnyboys as outsiders, alcoholic, Fieslinge or desperate, with their perfect depiction of his slide and his revolt reflected. 
As a director revealed Newman unknown sides of his real sensitive sensitivity. 
His Rachel, Rachel in 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian citizen Margaret Laurence) with his wife, Joanne Woodward in the main character, a feinsinniges women portrait was full of melancholy. 
He of his son, Scott lost by an overdose of this 1984, devoted his film Harry and son, a work full of delicacy and sadness. 
In the flood of honours from the yesterday on Newman, ergoss, said his close friend and former arms associate Robert Redford (they had together in the Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KID) played very taken its present, 'and this country has improved my life.' 
Generosity and life satisfaction were essential characteristics of the deceased actor. 
In addition to his legendary career is now a great supporter of civil rights, the environment and the independent cinemas, an opponent of the drift of Hollywood's, then. 
We have him often with the foot in nuts, in full, has left Saucen Vinaigrette or other foodstuffs, and this is quite distasteful, although we kept it initially were still asleep. 
The profits from its turnovers, still in his foundation for children in need. 
Instead of his myth rest, threw himself Newman until the shot. 
He has left behind its five daughters a letter with these principles: 'time and until the very end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star. 
It was a privilege to be here. ' 
And, for us, it was an honour, the life of a as intelligent and generous American actor should be allowed to follow. 
An exemplary citizens, in the closest and in the broadest sense. 
What has been produced in the accounting factory of supplement & amp; like? 
On 8 October negotiations will begin in the criminal case against János award, and his accomplices. 
The defendants, particularly in the organised crime, and grossly reckless damage and business fraud, and other criminal actions, among other things, accused of forging documents. 
According to prosecutor from the tenders have been used capitalized resources for their own purposes, while the services provided to deal with counterfeit bills were shown. 
State funds and subsidies from the self-government HUF 65 million in total - are part of the coffers of the organisation Fiatal Baloldal, part in the private funds of individual fees. 
As the investigation authorities were aware of the concern gave the tendering funds fictitious invoices and the clubs should also be failed to comply with its obligations. 
According to the indictment is a large part of the bills have been falsified. 
The accounting units on the market, which bought by Józsefváros Rundsiegel it allowed in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision of the bills on what companies should be issued on the tour, was north of Lake Balaton firmly with the István Lados was sent by János contract. 
In the wake of these '' Erkundungstour Lados pensions and restaurants should track down. 
He asked about the bills, later to Konsumationen on these proposals based bills for the youth and Sportministerium, social welfare and Labour Minister, as well as the autonomy of Budapest cheques. 
These calculations are predominantly by István Lados and his accomplices have been manipulated András ri, according to our information, the latter of those reports for the Constitution is rumoured to have been responsible. 
One of the objectives of Lados' "Erkundungstour" was a Bierlokal. 
As two of the award and CO in 2003 bills issued from the catering company, is the Group of the association neunzigköpfige Biztos Pont Egyesület bewirtet. 
Now, but the head of the business, such a large party would not even get to the local heart suit them. 
Another bill in the summer of 2002, issued at the foundation Jobb jövért, later known as Együtt a Harmadik évezredért, has also serious violation of form and content errors. 
In a retirement in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and not more than ten people at the same time can compose, according to bill 130 guests. 
The imagination of the counterfeiters were also apparently no bounds when it comes to the Pigal Kft., a catering business, in its accounting documents of customers, according to the indictment Hoppá Jobb jövért and not even proceeds of authority. 
As directors of hvg gyz Farkas. Hu indicated that he was immediately clear that it was forged documents, than it was during a survey by the Prosecutor's Office documents were provided. 
"our Firmenname and the tax number were on the mark wrong appropriate". 
And further: apart from procedural irregularities was also the fact wrong that the company is to have a hundred people living there, when they have a total of 11 rooms of the impossible so many people place. 
It is also on the bill, it would have been referred to feed the restaurant for some time now are no longer in operation. 
The diligent accounting counterfeiters have also neglected to check that the Budapest travel agency plans to target them exclusively offers trips abroad, and you have to take barzahlungs Hungarian visits, which indicated the accounting practice of company also denied. 
As it was known as part of the investigation, you are in addition to the bills also cited the VAT, although travel agency based on a country outside the EU, added value are tax-free. 
The level of VAT was a total of four from the hotel. To the foundation Révfülöp Kft Jobb jövért issued bills wrong because the company rather than 25 only 15 per cent VAT, set off by the staff will also be issued only mechanised bills were, however, the counterfeit documents noted. 
Another mistake, of the '' undermine Rechnungslegern was that it was the transport of goods in a case '' as output, although this had stated by the company specialising in investment advice being offered, told the prosecutor with. 
Another procedural irregularities, false accounting format, thanks to the wrong stamp - was that the on Együtt a Harmadik évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület Biztos Pont invoices issued and could be exposed as a fraud. 
As in the case of Ravenna. And the Sportlager BT Kunfehértó, whose business leaders protested that the bills never to have issued. 
Another "errors" is the counterfeiters in the HIB Kft. From Nyíregyháza undermined: this society was at the time (2001) just in dissolution, as the Group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület there have eaten - the Masseverwalter, was not issued, the bills themselves. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group of Rechnungsleger are people who have been well aware that they are fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal, the Foundation has Ifjú Szocialisták Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the Foundation, a Harmadik Együtt évezredért HUF in a level of some 4 million issued. 
According to the indictment was the manager of the Collab Kft. By one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi exhibition, persuaded the fictitious invoices. 
At the moment Biogate Kft is also in liquidation. Is also worked with award and company: in 2003, the Ltd, the foundation, as well as the Alapítvány Jobb jövért Atlasz vörösfeny Egyesület Egyesület and clubs with counterfeit bills in the total value of HUF have cared for 5 million to not services rendered. 
However, there was also little payment transactions, as the bills immediately after their exhibition cancelled what the victims have forgotten in your documents to be recorded, however. 
The third group of Rechnungsleger covers people directly associated with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian business leader of the Delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, where fuel and vehicle but not auffindbaren handelsfirma. 
This company is, in the period from October to December 2005 several bills on the sale of a total of edv-komponenten HUF have issued about 18 million. 
According to investigative authority is the since 14 September 2005 in liquidation lends cash investment Kft. From Kiskunhalas acts as a buyer of these bills. 
Directors of that company was one such documents, which the companies also Iván Kubatov should be delivered between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information has been Kubatov during the investigation, bills on behalf of gmbh. Atlasz and to the clubs, as well as Hoppá Együtt évezredért Alapítvány issued a Harmadik and whose value even touched. 
The companies fa-bani Jos Faipari Kft. And the jos-investment BT by Romanian bricklayers. Are Iván Kubatovs express request to be created. 
But in truth, none of these firms active Angeklagtem which, according to a lack of contracts. 
But he was able to benefit from the companies: at the request of his accomplices, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, with the preparation of the companies founding documents, he was charged in the name of the companies with premium bills in the clubs in contact, such as issued in Atlasz and y-generáció. 
As a whole, worth a total of 15 bills Kubatov HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies cash investment, Delta, Trió fa-bani Jos Linaxtrade Jos, investment and on the organizations have issued. 
The Prosecutor's office estimates that each Kubatov Rechnungssumme and 10% of the value added tax scheme could have. 
The company would even Kubatov szi-beri BT. For the exhibition imaginary bills have abused - in this case, the bills the candidacy of Biztos Pont disappeared. 
The company y-generáció and Szövetség a modern in January 2006 Magyarországért have their applications in the not-for-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Mihály TMA Táncsics Alapítvány (''). 
Both received the 500,000 Forint, however, have benefited from these sums being derailed. 
At this, you have to cover up the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft.. 
These calculations were also in the raid of the office of árpád Kemecsei in the Education Ministry assured. 
In the negotiations will now with a confession by some defendants on the approach of the accounting counterfeiting, as they were before the prosecutor, expected to be accounted for. 
A sensation could happen if the main defendants János award to a full confession decides. 
His previous indications were less detailed several times, and even though he had already pledged fully to report about everything, is still waiting for his confession. 
The question therefore remains open to question whether this is in its interests, whether the Socialists a pact with him about the compensation of most of the damage caused by HUF 50 million have concluded, and whether award in return is prepared to take responsibility. 
But it is entirely possible that contract now plays the "Beleidigten" after his requests to alleviate the imprisonment and house arrest have fallen on deaf ears. 
While other criminals with economic offences far greater damage and they do not have paid at liberty, or at least, remains under house arrest, denied supplement this possibility. 
The psychology of überbietens - or why we are willing to pay extra 
The buyer in Auctions tend to spend more and therefore to exaggerate the Feilgebotene. 
Neurologen and economic researchers at the University of New York, it is now managed to neurologisch- economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour to be discovered. 
According to a in the "science" magazine published study want the people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, not admit defeat, and we are prepared to pay even inflated prices. 
The researchers have tried, the neurological scheme of this "game" to explore with experimental auction. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto while the other armed action was taking part in a Games - in both cases, the active brain areas of the subjects through functional magnetischer resonance (fMRI). 
The participants in both play money could win, but there was a increased activity on the part of the Striatum, a complex below the Gehirnrinde, losers of the auction, measured in terms of the correctness of rival plays an important role. 
Among many other functions, this brain region important for the "of reward" of the nervous system is responsible. 
The researchers said the increase in price would be to avoid overreaction of the Striatums. 
In order to back their theory, the economists in the researchers group in addition research on Nachverfolgung of money. 
In this case, three groups against a partner organizations had to bid under different conditions. 
The control group has been the true value of the product, then you have told their operations. 
A different group has also promised to 15 dollar reward in the case that they emerge as a winner of the game. 
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, in the event of a lost game also were lost. 
The difference between the two groups was then only in that the emphasis in the one on the win, while the other was at the losing. 
As evidence of the hypothesis Neurologen expressed but were members of the "against the losing" group on the extent prepared to higher operations than those in the control or the '' improvement group. 
"This results fall of any previous economic theory. 
They have studied the behaviour in auctions so far, only with the pleasure about the win, or the risk avoidance is justified. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved, thanks to the imaging neurological processes, and that we now have a third statement in place ", said Andrew Schotter, professor of economic faculty of the University of New York. 
Hepatitis: when is the doctor? 
The world around half a billion people suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary, this chronic Lebererkrankung lists among the leading causes of death. 
The number of infected intensified, estimated at hundreds of thousands will be dealt with only seven thousand, however, what is that the patients often do not know that they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the name for various viruses, caused by infectious liver disease. 
The symptoms are similar - and often Leberentzündung Gelbsucht are often differ, however, the agent and the diseases from each other. 
Virus spread depending on the run on two different types: in hepatitis a and e through the digestive tract (for example by contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C or D, the viruses through blood and other body liquids (such as sperm, or Scheidensekret Speichel). 
Travellers will be a vaccination against the viruses A and B, in any case against the virus C recommended that there is no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis a show around zwei-drei weeks after eating the contaminated stored food and will feel uncomfortable in general, seem, stomach pain and weakness. 
Then Gelbsucht tramples on the skin, and in the eyes of the Chair is wildly, was plunged into darkness, and the recovery could take up to zwei-drei weeks. 
The world around 1 million people die every year in the caused by hepatitis B, far more serious diseases such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected in medication. 
Also hepatitis C can have serious consequences: unprocessed, it can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. 
Most infected do not even know about their illness because the pathogen destroyed the liver is insidious - in many cases, the first symptoms after 20-30 years. 
It is timely prevention, such as regular monitoring studies, is essential. 
There are three groups where the disease doing more and more often, those who have looked at a blood transfusion in 1991, drug addicts, and Tätowierte. 
At present, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers in the world to 200 million. 
Since the disease during a routine laboratory investigation is detectable, it is advisable, in the first signs of unknown origin was the family doctor. 
In time, the disease cured, the virus can be eradicated, increasing the risk of infection averted and prevent the development of cancer. 
The 30 September is world of hepatitis, 2004 by patients for the first time organised missions around the world. 
The aim of the action it is raising awareness of this chronic Leberentzündung caused by viruses, its creation and the importance of the early detection. 
Worshippers have less pain? 
As the latest research results show that the religious belief as a kind of "pain relievers' effect, which already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs. 
Scientists of Oxford University have carried out an interesting experiment: it has been investigated whether the belief in God, the pain of the human influences, reported the British '' telegraph. 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation ever received 12 believers and atheists electric shocks while studying a painting of the mother of God. 
As the results showed the faithful were able to switch off the bulk of pain. 
By means of a hirn-scan technology could even prove that Catholics have been able to activate the part of your brain, which is responsible for the pain of regulation. 
The study was the first in a research project, in the alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the University of participating. 
The subjects in the attempt was a funkelndes machine on the left hand, what the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to be greatly on two paintings to focus: a picture of the mother of God, painted in the 17th century from Sassoferrato, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vincis "lady with the Hermelin". 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the young girl Maria among the believers would create a kind of religious Trance, while you auswählten Vincis picture, because it is almost the other paintings difference and was seen as a reassuring. 
The individuals per half an hour crossing in a MRI scanner during this time, and received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they either the religious, or the other paintings should look. 
The Catholics reported they had been at the sight of the mother of God "in security" felt as if they were - '', and they would "calm and peace". 
During the Betrachtens religious Gemäldes you have about 12% reported less pain than if they had Leonardos work in mind. 
The psychologist Miguel Farias, also attended the attempt, said that it could be similar effects, also with other, strong retrospective images in the atheists, would need to be exposed the photograph. 
"We need to find a picture, the very positive feelings triggers, such as a mother or father", so the psychologist. 
The anglikanische Bishop Tom Wright, welcomed the results of the research. 
"The practice of the faith should change our personality, and is in many cases", so Wright. 
After these excellent results it still remains the question of what effect a madonna-bild Malers Leonardos or other comparable to the pain regulation of believers. 
The high-quality Virgin Mary would be even better results? 
You are what you on you mitteilst 
At its tenth birthday of Google can safely say: it is in the pockets of the people in the same way to find on their heads, as the sky: you know, where people have spent their holiday specialist, for what they are going, and what they move. 
And not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the chief executive officer of Google. 
In the direction of sceptics who are beset by Orwellian nightmare visions, he is very: they would host the essence of the Web 2.0. 
In an interview with the Financial Times said Schmidt recently, the main objective of Google is even more personal data on the user to collect and so the original objective to get closer to the company, which states that "all information" wants to sort out of this world. 
Schmidt said Google is after ten years weltverändernder work is still only at the beginning of the information collection. 
Asked after the status quo in five years, said Schmidt: he would like to Google would be able to questions like "what can I do tomorrow?" or "what job really fits me?" to answer, however, software programmes are not yet in a position to do this, because they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all internet-user are aware that, in the context of their Internet searching the Suchbegriffe were registered, as well as the IP addresses, from where sought, and the visited pages. 
The two years ago, for example, Personalized Search '' introduced its own Suchverlauf allows the visitors to resort to store and later so that the hit later can be generated a lot more precise, based on the same logic and also the so-called "Recommendations" with which the system of tailored products and services as a result of the previous preferences recommends. 
The user issues, though, is what is happening in the event of Datenmissbrauchs - "if you check what I make", are some concerned whether the Google data monopoly. 
In most cases, however, it is rather represented by the firm, potential power, the terrifying effect, and less the guilt or the fear of punishment, the quest for freedom or the rebellion against the power, with many internet-usern turn against it. 
However, it is a proven fact that the Suchbegriffe not only stored, but also in the character will be passed on to third parties, and in this legislative cases there is no protection for the rights of the internet-users. 
A perfect example was recently the action against paedophilia in Brazil, as part of its Google gave the Brazilian government information by the Gemeinschaftssite Orkut name '' have been collected and also a identification of Pädophilien. 
A personal rights worried users have been able to breathe a sigh of relief, but even in May than Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF successfully against the FBI to Court: that can Google also in future with no area of the Constitution be forced the FBI information to a secret question. 
(However, the Federal Government has successfully the publication of 50,000 Suchbegriffen Webadressen and 1000 years ago with reference to the minors act passed, but it was obtained from the list of individual users, or the two months Suchbegriffsliste Web- and retroactively.) 
So Google's image remains a contentious issue: those who are reluctant to their personal data because they are classified by the use of the google- services the loss of their private and privacy are afraid that plagues the company with the conservative performing firms due indignation. 
However, the American 'geek-kultur ", which is present in many countries, and enthusiastic Computerfans unites activists and youth, the next generation of" coolen entrepreneurs "in you, unlike Microsoft windows, is market leader, even if both at the same goal. 
A reason for this is that Google its users, in contrast to Microsoft, and no Identifizierungscodes demands of its services available for free, and that a more open, constantly updated far more attractive package used and new, young people and appear to be cooler than the official practices of the software giant. 
The Geeks, on the other hand, suggested the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet knife sharply - a relationship, particularly in the past few years thanks to the term "Web 2.0" in focus. 
The "Web 2.0" is nothing other than about collaboration, in other words, users have left deliberately traces and is the use of available channels of communication, and even if the proportions of individually are different, the main remains the same --- to show themselves in public. 
At the same time, to an average of young people can be managing several Community gateways, from Facebook profile of Xanga, this through other services, such as Twitter, or Musikdienste like last. FM, and can combine all this in a follow-up system such as friendfeed or blip. FM. In addition, blogs, which you can represent the latest Fotogalerien automatically on Flickr or Picasa geostet. 
And a number of other classic cases shows: looking at the Partyfotos last night, the friend soon, with whom she has untreuer friend vergnügt, or the staff will be dismissed, because he was in his blog only too honest his anger on the management of the air force, one thing is certain: the word "privacy" has now been interpreted completely new. 
Who leads a online-leben is what he preisgibt - by itself could be so in around the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's young people. 
And anyone who tries anything to keep secret, or even to circumvent the google- monopoly, that can be happy to do so - such as those with Scroogle, a Tool, which is on the search engine of Google zugreift, but deliberately no trail. 
Not a few people choose not to register on Community parties, so that they are not be setting ever-higher standards, but also the online applications, such as by Google and Textverarbeitungs- rss-feeds grafische tools and can deal with alternative versions, which are tied to no huge Serverparks and therefore not the best possible profiles of users it. 
However, public opinion is waiting to overcome by Google, its true face shows. 
With their current value of about $156 billion, the company even before IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), from Werbeflächen adwords / adsense threaten the revenue of the advertising agencies, and the ever faster imported services are preparing not only Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical observer, however, find the disturbing Gegenpole: for example, the company has led a protest by the staff completely dismissed the charges, after the company's children garden doubled, also said the management of the frequent meals of staff is too costly. All this sounds but quite mild against the fact that Google in 2006 even before the Chinese Government to its knees, and with an agreement was critical hits, for all the regime, or those who are against the good taste, were extracted. 
The internal regulation of the group is that no new service advertised in advance, but only if they could already is available. However, the events of the next few months and years back some strong department: while some believe Google's Buch- and Magazinscan- or archiving project now take proportions that the company soon with the Supreme Court should address other rather, it is because of the system "health" concerned that the creation of a complete health profile on the basis of convicted, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google provides a genetic database, building the next generation of sci-fi writers already the substance, about '' the famous Scroogled Cory Doctorow novel with the best of Orwellian fashion describes a future in which one person thanks of Google nahbar frighteningly personal data. 
Two young people help the double murderer of ózd in the traces elimination 
In connection with the double murder of ózd, the police are now two young people suspected of being interrogated, in the removal of the traces to have helped the police spokesman, told the Commission on Tuesday Borsod. 
The young people were currently geständig, they will be accused of aid. 
According to information from the news agency MTI are two girls who defend still at large. 
Aid with a prison sentence of up to five years under threat. 
The suspect of the double murder of ózd ortsansässiger, a 23-year-old man on Sunday, was remanded in custody. 
The man is under urgent suspicion, from avarice of deliberately killed several people. 
During the investigation, it has emerged that the 23-year-old a 53-jährigen due to a larger sum of money. 
The suspects wanted to settle its debts, therefore, but not his creditors lockte last Wednesday at a site in ózd, where he murdered after nine years of him and his daughter. 
According to the MTI, the man of action plan - it also proves the fact that he was the murders with a at the scene of the crime hidden weapon. 
Together with experts is now investigating the no details of the police and the circumstances of their use. 
Warsaw stock exchange places for Prague stock exchange Kaufangebot 
Some 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw stock market for the 100% purchase of the company packages offered by the Prague stock exchange. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw stock exchange, reiterated the offer the Poland had, despite the fact that they used by the Czechs as a potential owners of their stock exchange were excluded. 
Reason for this is that the Warsaw stock exchange into the state. 
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state, however, more than 60% of the papers in the coming months to sell. 
After reports of the Czech daily 'E15 "includes the stand so far of Poland, the highest purchase price for the Prague stock exchange ever been offered. 
As the newspaper reports that the Vienna stock exchange have until now, the NASDAQ transatlantic, the New York stock exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German stock exchange offers. 
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague stock exchange, said last week that of all the stakeholders the Warsaw stock exchange probably the worst new owners also closed, and he would not lose that, even in the future to the closure of the Prague stock exchange could lead. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange at 5-10 billion kronor. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders could be sold 90% of the shares. 
Most owners of the Prague stock exchange is the Patria investment bank gained with a 25% participation, followed by the Bank with Sporitelna Ceská 14.7 and the tigers holding four S. A. R. L. with 13.5 percent. 
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers 
The continues in their time of accelerating international financial crisis language commentary on Tuesday devoted some leading European leaves already by the "second 9 / 11". 
The global financial disaster we have thanks to the US President, said some "La Repubblica" - the President had not been even capable of his own party for the bill is behind it, the little relief in the scary situation should... 
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the billions on investor Warren Buffett put it, it would be preferable, from a "second to talk about 9 / 11". 
Sections of the press in Madrid places the scapegoat, also in Washington. 
According to the "El Mundo" is the lack of political leadership to blame for the global economy now stands on the brink of the collapse. 
The American financial system increasingly threatened with collapse, and including the whole world suffering. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but they are now threatened after the vote in Congress the risk that Washington is not a political means of crisis management has to offer. 
The world economy is in the air, just at a time when one of the largest transformations of the history of capitalism takes place. 
The threat we can no longer ignore Geneva ", says some of the day scoreboard". 
Although some States could still acknowledge their crashing financial organisations rescue packages available, and the banks with the taxpayers' money saved from bankruptcy. 
Triggered a domino effect will, however, and there are even more banks collapse, then neither further injections, or other emergency measures. 
In the long term, the EU Member States over their specialization and centralise control of the money markets. 
On Monday alone, more than 100 billion euros in faltering financial institutions, paid out of the Vienna "the standard". In addition, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more and more realistic that, after the Americans now includes the European taxpayers something deeper into their pockets needed to emerge from the crisis. 
So far, the EU is not serious about the crisis - like a tsunami does away with the old continents. 
The "saviour" would not immediately with several hundred billion euros "master", but it would be advisable to note, in which case it is reasonable, the taxpayers' money to see an even greater damage being done. 
The flight of the intelligent car imitiert Hummel 
What would be the best way to the development of new technologies to accident prevention, if not the hindernis- sensors from the nature to imitate? 
For example, the bees. 
At CEATEC Japan was presented a startling project, in which the nissan- engineers of Hummeln in the creation of new accident vermeidender systems have been inspired. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo University has managed by Autorobotern Nissan biomimetische system built by the type BR23C, a mini-auto, equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim to support the development of a system that avoids any collisions. 
In the flight each bee forms its own oval "private area", of our own "shield" is very similar, said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technologie-pr and research development during the exhibition. 
The composite eye of the bee in every direction, and in a corner of more than 300 degrees can see games to play an important role. 
The function of the composite eye, the researchers tried to imitate the idea of the lasergesteuerten distance a knife. 
It identifies obstacles in the BR23C in a Gesichtsfeld of 180 degrees within 2 metres, its distances and sends signals to the Mikroprozessor on board, the process immediately avoided the collision. 
The obstacle is registered in fractions of seconds, and the Autoroboter immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, allowing the tyres at the appropriate spot. 
Unlike previous systems will take place this ploy purely instinctively. 
"If there were no Autoroboter could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, the head of the "mobility laboratory" and the autoroboter-projektes. 
The system must respond instinctively and immediately because the technology the intimate and most vulnerable part of the shield - a coating inside the accidents still as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the behaviour of the bees, if you avoid other bees. 
And that must take place in the fraction of a second. 
The duck cannot, however, in contrast to the bees, right up, not down, or even diagonal - it can only be developed along two dimensions and only in the direction of the tyre Wendbarkeit. 
Here during the bees infinitely many opportunities available to other bees, the researchers have been able to sidestep the Autoroboter only the Drehbewegung, or of speeding up and Abbremsens. 
The contains BR23C lithium- polymer batteries, which are more and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer life than traditional lithium-ionenbatterien. 
Andoh, said it is the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store them. 
This machine per second only a few inputs must process and respond to them. 
It must not store them, or on the basis of previous manoeuvres, logical reaction producing a generates intuitions, so it is constantly just a handful of KB Memory to be used. 
There is no need for Gigabyte- and Megabyte-schwerer Memories. 
This is the first step in the evolution of the immediate collision avoidance technology, according to an estimate by Nissan within the next ten years will be serial residence in production. 
Another application of the technology could find in the GPS satellite navigation, making it the motorists aware and draws on barriers around him as the target. 
A name for the child sündteure 
Now is the written version of the law before 700-mrd-dollar heavy rescue package, which will apply in various stages and on the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round of the half of the money should be spent. 
In a session, the East coast after midnight local time on Saturday ended, the Congressmen have started next to an agreement on the debates managed 700-milliarden-dollar heavy rescue package, Reuters reported. 
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic President in the US House of Representatives, and said the agreement that we should only on paper. 
The compromise reached on the bailout - supported both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the result: the programme will have an effect and it will only be effective, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi if it were not talking about the rescue of Wall Street, but the helm of the economy rumzureißen. 
The written version of the package was made even before the opening of the Asian markets, 8 p. m. on Sunday night, Washington time (Central European time Monday 2 a. m.), but has no Indian Ocean, published on the stock. 
The Congress on Monday is first on the bill to stabilise the economy from 2008, then the Senate's turn. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday night, with Pelosi, and also the White House welcomed the news of the deal. 
We are pleased with the progress made in the night and appreciate the efforts from both parties, our markets to stabilise and to protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House. 
The programme but deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, which claims that the $700 billion for the purchase, lazy, with loans of strain in the securities should be spent. 
In a first tranche is a maximum of half of the 700-milliarden-betrages 250 billion will be spent, and are available immediately after the Congress as expected on Monday will vote on the issue. This sum is credit for the purchase of contaminated, poor securities will be spent, and the other is $100 billion the President decide. 
The programme will be reviewed by a own Commission, who also is a member of the President of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of 700 billion depends on another decision of Congress. 
In the spirit of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactics: it can at the same time bad loans, mortgages and securities purchased using laden with mortgages, or other "toxic" loans. 
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, can the purchase both in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the companies to take part in an insurance scheme, in which the Ministry of Finance the disturbing funding secured, and the companies the anticipated damage similar charges. 
Henry Paulsen said: the law defines the tools necessary so that up to 700 billion dollars in emergency aid for the American financial system can be made available, be it for the large-scale purchase bad money, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk by the collapse of a major Geldinstituts is triggered. 
We have the necessary steps so that we are prepared for the introduction of the law, as soon as we signed, so Paulson. 
The heads of the hard-pressed and now reliant on government aid, however, banks can expect that their controls in the übersee-slang colloquially known as' 'golden Handshake, the government will be cut. 
A cut in salaries, there will be only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Ministry of Finance aushilft respectively. 
The reduction in essence means that if the department as part of an auction buying, '' the golden Handshake is taxed, unless the outgoing Bankenchef will go to the retirement. 
In the event of a direct purchases of bad loans is the government's aggressive play to ensure that the managers' salaries should not be exaggerated. 
The picture is that the existing golden handshake- contracts are not changed - the restrictions only pertains to new agreements so that all the more people to take part in the programme. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts in manager- salaries are governed by law, annotated the Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, the measure. 
The state wins rights of participation for the participating banks, so that the risk to the taxpayer is declining, as they are, as soon as it can also join the economy and hence the Geretteten bank is better off again. 
The draft law stipulates that the President of the Congress over the next five years to submit a proposal as the taxpayer needs to regain its lost money from the financial sector to get back. 
However, there were on both sides, the sceptics in relation to the plan have expressed their doubts. 
This is not what the American citizens expect from us, the plan will help protect taxpayers' money under any circumstances, so the Californian Republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: the measures were propelled by the same people, including the collapse of the Wall Street are responsible.

The German-speaking area Presseschau 
The rights camp is intact, only the electorate was within the camp more assertive - described as "Spiegel" the poor performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria, Haider and CO ready to govern, in order to prevent a rot-schwarze coalition. 
The mirror (mirror. De). 
In the online edition of the left even though German news magazine Franz Walter analysed the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "their fathers vertilgt Bavaria revolution". 
According to the renowned political theorists, began the erosion of CSU long before the sad beckstein-huber-duo took its offices. 
The Christian social have renewed Bavaria for decades - now it is precisely the modern citizens to contact them. 
The Epochenbruch is also a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite surprising was the failure of the CSU, but on Sunday is not something to an end, however, what is already almost exactly ten years emerged: the clear dominance of a state party 
For ten years, 1998, ends up in the CSU 47.7 per cent and fell for the first time since the 1950s under the fünfzig-prozent-marke 
The repeated itself three years ago at the Bundestag 2005 elections, which is still in the much-talked-about stoiber-ära. 
The of the CSU in the land of modernisation has consistently run at the end of their own mothers and fathers vertilgt. 
Sociologists have already forecast 40 years ago, but in the pace considerably verschätzt. But without effects, the secularisation of educational success, the recruitment of Eastern and Norddeutschen in the prosperous regions in Bavaria to the loyalty of the csu-wähler not remain. 
Modernisation is always accompanied by options propagation. And this has political consequences. 
The rights camp is intact - only the voters inside the camp were critical and own them. 
It is striking that in the last few weeks is the classic civil society groups expressed the biggest detachment from the CSU: the professions, the commercial Bürgertum and voters with levels as degrees. 
Here, the support of the CSU on even under 40 percent.

Spö-chef Werner Faymann, reiterated its desire to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that a cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - in some Federal States and in the social partnership, this is already the case. 
The question of whether he is because a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current övp-chef as Vice-Chancellor, could imagine Faymann left open. 
As he said, voters would have to be voted out of office schüssel-molterer-kurs. 
A repeat of this direction would not in question. 
But Molterer has reacted cautiously on red offers. 
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said that he believed if Faymann attempt to interfere in the internal concerns of the ÖVP. 
If his party in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed övp-intern. 
Bzö-chef Jörg Haider was open in all directions. 
"in order to prevent rot-schwarz, we are ready to assume responsibility of the government ', so Haider.

Also stressed Járóka that education is a basic human right, which has a key role to play in the assertion of other human rights.

A Roma pupils than ever before, the more the school begins to increase its opportunities for productive Member of the labour market; and through income tax and VAT, they do their contribution to the national expenditure. 
"as the European Union citizens the right to the Roma must be guaranteed quality education, the bad and segregierte lessons needed to be abandoned", Mrs Járóka,.

CSU mercy on time. 
At the end of October, about the fate of the fallen Duos huber-beckstein decided 
Despite the Wahldebakels roles in the meantime no heads, at the top of the Bavarian CSU debates have been postponed the staff. 
A party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their posts, the question is how long this mercy lasts. 
The fate of the tandems after the disastrous 17-prozentigen ballot loss on the last October weekend will be decided at the special Congress. 
The deal already gescholtene double act, but suggested that it would not name off their bellies. 
So that you want to appease angry Group and the left's rank and file, a day after the tsunami '' of Bavaria, given the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences. 
Five years ago, admittedly, under the leadership of the in his career highlight the Edmund Stoiber, received the Christian Social Union still 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they could only 43.4% of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years Alleinregierer '' in Bavaria, which accounts for 18 percent of the German GDP. 
The Conservatives are the dominant force in the also for the Hungarian economy important southern province in the future, but in a coalition government. 
The first signal of the Party internal restructuring, the potential successor Hubers, Vice-President and federal Agriculture Minister Horst Seehofer also involved in the Erkundungsteam, the with the liberal FDP, or the rechtsgerichteten "free voters' exploratory talks on a possible Munich coalition. 
A twist of fate, it is equal that with the list of "free" those Gabriele Pauli voters in the terms, which are imbued anti-stoiber huber-beckstein has exploited by the double act first and then the determined politician abzuservieren mercilessly. 
The csu-führung now concentrated all its energies on the stabilisation Becksteins. 
In the transition process will be the Stoiber, pulling the strings so far from the background, took an active role. The former Prime Minister and the 28 September csu-vorsitzender called the "most bitter day of his political career". 
Huber on Monday made a couple of toxic comments in the direction of CDU, in his view, the CSU would have far more support from the sister party deserves. 
Other csu-politiker interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel. 
If the CSU, the 2005 at a national level has contributed to the success, not with a joint venture back on its feet, Merkel can be called after the Bundestag election in September 2009, Chancellor will not return. 
Merkel from their disappointment about the fiasco has made no secret, believes that the ground loss of CSU have a negative impact on the grand coalition will impact in Berlin. 
What, however, relatively: the injured CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, is continuing. 
18.6 percent received the SPD has hitherto best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Mr Lukashenko 110-0 opposition. 
In the elections on Sunday, it was not a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian Parliament. 
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability in the country, conducted by Alexander Lukashenko, however, the OECD suspected breaches of law in the counting of the votes. 
The OECD, from 43 countries, has sent 450 observers, the elections not recognised. 
De terms of 10-millionen-einwohnerstaates does for decades without opposition from the. However, under the name "United Democratic Forces' (ODS) held view before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko seriously hoped for in the unhealthy elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment already 2006 presidential mandate renewed, this time for the fourth time some members of the opposition in the Parliament '' would allow. 
This is why the ODS even by the previously planned boycotts. 
The Ukraine, thanks to the rising price of natural gas imports of becoming ever more dependent on Russia economically. For the relief of the price increases were even credits, and the country has included the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the leading gas pipeline across the country, the Russians. In the background of the expectations of the opposition was thus the hope, Ukraine wants to improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-level politicians classified as anti-democratic because of the political system in the EU travel ban. 
For a temporary relaxation caused the evaluation report of the election of the OECD, in which the accent on the positive movements, rather than the shortcomings, such as the exclusion of one third of the opposition candidates from elections - was. 
The quickly, however, the OECD report criticised the campaign on Monday - therefore should not happen opposition in the press, especially the fact that the opposition in the counting of the votes was allowed to be present. 
Despite all this, the opposition is a recovery in the political system: political prisoners have been released in, for example, and Minsk is even prepared to smaller confrontations with Moscow, while it remains the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with the Ukraine on paper is a Föderativstaat, the two areas regarded as independent for a month. 
"We have two steps forward and backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
According to the opposition candidate in the presidential elections of 2006, is a continuation of desirable, although "the powerful fear, also received only to let a opposition in the Parliament". 
The opposition is planning a protest action following the results, but rather the need for economic reform the electorate. 
"We have here with many problems - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities have obstacles in the way on distribution, but nevertheless, I have noticed that more and more people support the change, even the older", said Milinkevich, in allusion to the fact that not even the most support pensioners' group agrees with the Lukashenko regime whose sole credit for the production of social security. 
"thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time before the to the silence of a Friedhofes gemahnende" Social Security "to crumble, so Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politicians have Russian observers described the election as a democratic. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States told the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the actions, and not the words". The absence of the opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the White Russian voters. 
Brunetta: "before the work is now eating any breakfast"

From the officials there has been no resistance, assured the Secretary-General: "This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides". 
All in all, there is therefore no breakfast during working hours more; final with coffee or Croissant. 
Brunetta's advises this with a smile: "a good cappuccino at 7 a. m. 's magic".

He adds that it is necessary, the effectiveness of public administration of Italy to strengthen 
"The lohn-dynamiken - so the Minister - in the last 8-10 years were twice as large as the private sector and far more than the inflation rate". 
In the meantime, thousands of civil servants together in order to brunetta- decree within the framework of the appeal to counter supported by Codacons. 
"during the Minister for the public service with figures on lower Absenzen at work, says he made the consumer central - the people of '' some lazy people working continuously.

In particular, before the regional administrative court (TAR) for additional financial compensation for work-related illness; it will also have the planned expansion of the mandatory house arrest of health insurance Arbeiternehmers, during which controls can be made and other aspects of the innovations of the Minister contested. 
Napolitano: "preventing accidents at work is crucial" 
Happen every day in Italy industrial accidents, 2500 deaths and 27 left three people rendering life. 
For the year 2007 confirm the data from the European university Alliance (Inail contro gli infortuni sul) that could the fatal accidents at around 1200. 
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon, the kind of nearly twice as many deaths as caused by murders. 
Today, the Alliance (Anmil Associazione Mutilati e Invalidi del could) in all provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, and so the attention of the social institutions and media at this tragic situation. 
"The worrying, of Anmil widespread data and the tragic news these days, as crucial to confirm the issue of prevention in the workplace." confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in its communication to the President of Amil Mutilati Associazione Alliance (DE) Pietro Mercandelli Invalidi del could. 
The head of state is his "big appreciation of the constant commitment for the prevention of the jobs, for the protection of the injured workers, the aid for the families of the victims and to raise awareness of the public opinion". 
"a empörtes" Basta "has levied on; course in tragedies, relative to its size, some vertebral in the media and the public sympathy. But the reality is confronting us often with dramatic events in its own momentum even again. ' 
Napolitano does not hide that "it in any case, also a resource problem is crucial: it must be invested in education and information." 
A special importance is growing the many initiatives for a more direct realisation in school framework on the part of the young people to feed the world of work. 
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not detract from his social seriously. What is needed is a legislative norm in force and improvement. 
For his part, the President of the House Gianfranco Fini stresses "as the phenomenon of work-related deaths, a pressing social emergency picture of what the conscience of all of us, and insulted all institutions compel on firm rules that corresponds to the goal to put an end to the problem". 
"The data from the workplace accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, it does not, however, is that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," stresses President of Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
"We do not want these" positive trend means "less attention at the end of the day. That caused the tragedy." 
"How do that, in fact, does too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents by various actions. We can fight against it. 
More checks and inspections of what we think are necessary so Mercandelli; but even stronger measures to raise workers who start in school ". 
"a more effort is needed - so, he added, as the communication and the awareness of public opinion. 
But, above all, is something bigger sense of responsibility on the part of the employers a phenomenon, that is a social event of an emergency, "asked. 
Mercandelli was crucial to "the gradual deterioration of the protection for the labour accident victims to speak and condemned the" elimination of the social system, against which we fight in recent years ". 
"the aim is therefore, the workers back to a guarantee to insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a work-related accident not on voluntary or accidental donations, from time to time by a legislator," will be decided on. 
MP3 players under threat of hearing impairment charges. 
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable Musikgeräten, such as MP3 players to hear, can lead to permanent hearing damage. 
This, the European Commission, which asks in one in Brussels today vogue report the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks, quoted by the EU. 
"the report as it says in a comment will be clear that 5-10% of those who on a weekly basis for at least five years longer than an hour on the day of loud music with portable Musikgeräten to hear the permanent loss of their hearing at risk". 
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people, the usual portable Musikgeräte and mobile phones on a high volume of their hearing, without being aware of it," irreparably damage so Meglena Kuneva. 
"from the scientific considered part of the EU, it says there is a clear risk, which is pressing for quick action. 
What really matters, it is the consumer awareness, and this information to make public good. 
We have given this scientific knowledge of the existing control systems check again, so that they are completely effective and keep pace with the new technology ". 
Brussels, the independent scientific committee had given the widespread use of the portable Musikgeräte among young people. 
"the scientists - so does the communication from the EU, confirm that it is rightly concerned, and that the EU Commission, together with the other EU members and the affected will now take the necessary measures will examine for children and young people better before the noise from portable Musikgeräten and similar devices will be able to protect". 
There is already a European standard at the moment, the level of the noise of portable Musikgeräten to 100 decibels limited. The concern about the damage caused by a large excessive noise could come. 
You can limit the damage, in which it will be very much to solutions such as reducing the noise and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the Scientific Committee of the EU to point out that, if the users of portable Musikgeräten only five hours per week noisy (louder than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits are already passed on the maximum noise can apply to the job. 
Those who cross the border music, the complete loss of hearing within five years. 
So the 5-10% of users of these devices, the number of between 2.5 and 10 million people are estimated in the EU. 
Roma, Alemanno is open the door to "Commission for the future of capital ' 
We are starting today, in March is, will be over in June. 
This is set by the Capitol for the work of the end 'Commission on the future of the capital Rome ". The Commission has this morning in the new seat behind the caracalla-thermen.

There is no redistribution of powers, only the will, a place to have a great project in which you can develop for Rome. 
In March will be completed its task and the Commission will return away, because one such project must have a certain point of arrival. 
In June, the Lord Mayor - we will be announced the strategic plan, in which we imagine the work undertaken by the Commission will use ". 
Who the competence of the Commission, as it is in question, the binding opinion ermangele Alemanno told her: "everything depends on the work of the Commission and will make the quality of their proposals. 
If you, like in France, the attali- Commission, high-quality results in Rome and this will certainly be the case your contribution will then be fundamentally. 
The policy too often deals with the day-to-day problems and emergencies, from time to time. 
We, however, want a longer period of time in mind, so seriously with in a deeper perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the city of work ". 
The Lord Mayor of Rome is very keen to clarify the following "this Commission is neither an empty establishment, still a wreck: it is absolutely free of the Roman citizens, it will cost a penny and it will be with us. It will reflect concern the best brains in the capital".

Obama the first anti-American President here a statement? 
A well-known American politicians, which are eager to be deemed independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American President. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, through its decisions, was wiping out the economy of the United States and the strength of relations with the befeindeten Islam (and still is) today as a private citizen ". 
The attacks on Obama are becoming aggressive, especially now that the elections closer. 
A lady from Miami, said in an Internet page wrote: "this person is ambitious. 
Obama is very vehemently: he thinks it will be the highest office of a nation, received a total of two black governors and five black senators has seen! ". 
These attacks but not actually have a lot to say; it is not racist attacks and they answer the question of voters: he will be a good President? and then there is also the polls; all say that Obama will win with a strong lead. 
Even in that case, left, with the heart and not with the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, in its editorial in the only in the Wahlkabine wrote that we are likely to know who the real American patriot will be his voice. 
This is also a mentality of the United States, which revealed up to end was kept hidden. 
"says what we want, then we will decide for whom we will make our Kreuchen, whether for Obama or McCain." 
There are people in the swear: If Obama wins, we will move from America. 
Something that we never before heard only now, when the success of the black candidate seems so sure. 
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the democrats, George Bush. 
1500 people were asked: what mistakes during his time in office, Bush committed? 89% replied: the war in Iraq. 
America is changing. 
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was in the pants with a force sent home again. 
In Iraq have 4 500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to attack. 
However, Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness of Bush. 
The person who will take their place, faces a huge task. 
USA. The financial collapse has left its mark on journalists: in the newspapers the cuts can be felt. And many blame for the Internet, "murderers" of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been taken by the Pew research center about their situation and their mental control concerning the future. 
Today, almost all journalists pessimistic about their future. 
However, you said to the information on relevant not really concerned about the overall credibility. 
They do not feel less alone as in the past. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The crisis of 2008 is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model, which has been destroyed. 
In addition to the big problems caused by the ground, so the Newsroom cuts of the area in which the editors work in the newspaper. 
It is a problem that must be resolved so the interviewed journalists if we do not want traditional journalism, such as the big audience understands it, is not much is shrinking. 
A clear, but more complicated today met the American journalist pessimism. 
Six out of ten journalists and executive Seniors of the written press are of the view that the journalism at national level on the wrong track. 
In the local area are among the Executives even to the 65%. 
Print. Broadcast vs. 
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine that in the direction of the web. 
The main publishing groups trains is the way to the Internet, which many than the '' killer '' of the written press. 
"the economic pressure" by the journalists, is felt by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that you want to join the new technology, in the hope "they bring something positive for the journalism". 
The biggest rift is the American journalism today between the editors-in-chief of the Newsroom and reporters that the working for them. 
56% of their editors-in-chief at national level, are sure of their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level only 23%. 
Some thinking, it has to do with the "security" to do the work. 
The company manager, the fear of their work within three years to lose, account for 47% nationally. 
In the journalists are 30%). 
The subject of a 'safe work' 'in the team (our editors', which in other red.) in the United States is always a hot topic. 
Only 13% of the journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation, as the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and tv-sendern and Internet operators offer the employer as you like and it is a question of take it or leave it. 
The who get very high wages very often, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes get only 10000 euros a month, plus pension and insurance money. 
What holiday is concerned, there is the matter of complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so many after the third, finally, after a number of years to reach 15 Ferientage. 
But the American journalists are, as you say, often in the course of the year "sick". 
It is a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: Court in Rome in Grottaferrata DANILO Coppola remains. 
The President of the second criminal division of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate broker. This had asked of Grottaferrata to be moved to Rome. 
It is against because Bankrot Coppola in the context of the investigation into the Gegenvereinbarung in the case of the takeover of unipol-bnl.. 
In the course of the process over the last week against him, it was his release from house arrest in a residence duty in Grottaferrata changed. 
His lawyers and Michele Gentiloni Gaetano Pecorella had asked, to allow the estate agents from the provincial town in a flat in the capital to be moved. 
According to the Court he could arrange transfers (against which the prosecutor called) provide the opportunity to influence its society, and that it anklagendes evidence. 
The elite is in danger of 
The phenomenon had already revealed a few days than the Chamber of Deputies, committing against the $700 billion dollar sparpaket of the White House agreed: a large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing, the Wall Street than to save the economy. 
Confirmed that yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reported back, such as the crisis in the Republican Party Laufschritt that is increasingly divided in their old divides and moderate East coast-seele, which is always the state institutions, and the business community, and the neoconservative, 'those in Washington, "and the financial sector, and particularly hostile to the south and the centre of the States electorate. 
This part of the Party owes his rise of V. a. the voice of the I referred to above. 
This aforementioned example, however, is only a small part of the great changes that will announce the current economic earthquake or even already represents: not only in the United States, including throughout the West, and perhaps even on this, this will be affected. 
Both in the States and in Europe, it seems that the crisis to speed up the long feared events, which under this new conditions finally take shape and come to light. 
The first of these phenomena is the recent discovery, the outrageous renaissance of the State in connection with a sort of renationalisation of the economy. 
In fact means the crisis a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close links to the abroad and at the same time a tremendous amount of the assets of private individuals who manage to live in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: as to the affected families to behaviour, which is also an enormous Wählermasse. 
The crisis seems economically politically against global, it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism would seem to be put to one side and his freedom of speech to have lost: the obvious proof has been given by the EU which, because of their division in various national and international conflicts to find no common way. 
So all now count with the intrusion of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and B. a. distribution of relief funds: since the crisis was always more seriously, only the United States in the economic situation without foreign aid to save. 
And, in addition to the resources they have also the legitimacy of using them, therefore, two not to überwertende conditions under certain circumstances, in what otherwise have no international organisation and a market could be in a similar way. 
The new emphasis on the staatlich- national element, is also in perfectly compatible with the growing importance, the recently in the economy with a closely related sector is implicated: the territoriality. 
More paradoxical way, it is just now than we were so convinced, however, long in a networked Gesamtreich to be entered into an empire of the increasingly sophisticated technologies, of the intangible that we need to establish our future, as more and more from the essential material things will depend, of water, harvest and oil. 
They can certainly all from one place to the rest of the world, but are yet to be transported to extreme with a closely linked a territory umschriebenen piece of earth. 
The person who is therefore on such a territory, a towards others in an ernteertraglosen wasserlosen or oil, free area lives, the advantage. 
I come to the second novelty, but a brief insertion. 
Who territory, who government policy says, who also says that leadership. 
In that sense, I think that the financial crisis to produce two converging phenomena. 
One hand there is the knowledge about the need for distinguished Leaderships, the need for someone who knows how to regulate the things. 
On the other side there is now a wave of indignation at the current leaders, particularly those of the economy, which turns as inadequate and full of Schattenzonen. 
In addition to a more far-reaching and in some ways even more worrying aspect: a loss of confidence, a impatience, a picture of the futility, a sense of distance, which is all to a whole class of managers of the Western countries. 
It seems so the conviction among large sections of the population solution that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but their Ideenwelt, their way of life, their culture in the broad sense of the word, whose content, whether the majority always as a foreign and outdated. 
The demand for leadership so cultivating a diverse underground but powerful movement and the removal of the leaders of the traditional political establishment. This is manifest in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in unvermittelten collective emotions swing in the state of the last time, starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, the rebellion of the American Members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the rights also plays a role in Italy here). 
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programmes, but also its observance, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what today in the bottom of the social strata of the West, and reinforced by the financial crisis and to überdimensionalität ambitions. 
Given all this, it would be too much of a "rebellion of mass" to speak. 
The eyes but far to keep an open mind, however, is certainly not. 
The walls goes up in Superkleber leaves 
The forces of heavy thanks to a Klebstoffes hochklettern and the walls to be able to defeat as Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which now apparently has reached almost there. 
In an area with a mob of only 2.5 qcm Kleber, the researchers produced a 100 kg of serious body to peg on a senkrechten wall. 
The studio has an American magazine, the results of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the air force published research laboratory. 
The material invented by the research team is a further development of already used in glues, what a particular carbon structure, known as kohlenstoff-nanoröhrchen, use. 
"the principle of Klebers you can feel like a number to a batch of spaghetti angeordneter piping Zhong Lin imagine", says Mr Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. 
The scientists did of the feet of inspiration Geckos, which is covered by mikroskopischen Härchen, a perfect stop the animal. 
The with various materials such as glass of Teflon and cutting paper conducted tests have shown that the new Kleber ten times more than the Haltefähigkeit the feet of the reptiles and at the same time away from the Wall "easily", so Liming Dai leaves, researchers in the school of engineering sciences at the University of Dayton. 
On walls along walking? "this material could be used as deciduous glue 'presupposes, Liming Dai. 
On walls around like Spiderman emporzugehen? perhaps, but the researchers think more reminiscent of a less fascinating benefits, such as the link of electrical appliances, because the Nanoröhrchen are just as head of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of application could be in the field of space. 
For the moment, so the Superhelden must still have to wait. 
The other type of research, the University of Berkeley, California, to a new Kleberart. 
In an article in the American chemical society the Californian researchers present a glue from Mikrofasern like hair by movement on a surface of the dust cleaning and this has been a perfect liability. 
Medicines never play with fruit juice. 
Caution before, Orangen- Grapefruit- and apple juice. 
These drinks which, because of their refreshing quality and their vitamin wealth B. a. in the summer of consumed, can be extremely harmful to health, if you at the same time with certain vital medicines, since it will be taken on the resumption of this by the body can impact in extreme way. 
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, has repeatedly on the risk verpackter as fresh fruit juices in conjunction with drugs use. Within the framework of the 236. Meetings of the American chemical society in Philadelphia, he suggested once again raising the alarm: it is a glass, Grapefruitsaft Apfel- Orangen- or the absorption of certain vital medicines as far as to reduce that they are practically eliminated, and the health of the patients at risk. 
Grapefruitsaft was already under suspicion, to be responsible for the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika Herzkreislaufmedikamente anxiolytischer, resources, and to neurological, to toxic levels. 
Medicines in danger had the same agency of the medicine in a report two years ago doctors and patients warned against the dangers of this mix, and to ensure stressed, which, in conjunction with products such as Diazepan or Metadon drinking it. 
It is not only GRAPEFRUIT juice, according to the experts also contain substances and apple juice, which can hamper the medicines. 
The list of the fruit juices gehemmten substances is long. 
So the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università owes di Milano: "such results will usually immediately to the various international manufacturer, which passed, it would be free to change the consumer information. 
It is recommended, therefore always read the package leaflets and, if still confusion, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or a doctor, "stresses the expert from the ansa-agentur. 
Economic Nobel peace prize goes to Paul Krugman 
The economic Nobel prize is for Americans Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the location of economic activity. 
The 55 years old Krugman is a Neokeynesianer, who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the economic and held foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of Enron collapse, Krugman was in an editorial in the New York Times claims that this second event is crucial for the history of the United States as the attacks. 
A prediction that are not little controversy in response, and the economists has been criticised for some years later today, but as quite right. 
"I am surprised and shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals within the framework of the breakdown of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the public focus," said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi by the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank is Krugman a "economist of great value", but also a Banalisierer with a "very aggressive style, particularly against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration." 
Open office, it seems the third version of the '' package anti-microsoft 
The day of the publication of 3.0 has come openoffice. Org; the open source software wins as the cost of free replacement for Microsoft's office an increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among independent workers and the public administration. 
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, what of Sun Microsystems is monitored, is the new open office now with some new features the audience: apart from a revised and now Anfangsmenü spartanischer is now as much a fundamentally ensured compatibility with os X operating system 'McJobs' Apples, and support for the new ODF (open document format) 1.2 format, the latest standard-iso version. 
Eight against was also on the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (. Docx,. Xlsx. Pptx), can be read by openoffice. 
Some new features are also interesting, such as those of the allows the size of Powerpoint presentations, for example, to reduce the ability to send via email. These include the possibility of pdf files in graphic display processing module to import the original appearance and at the same time to preserve the side. 
It is now also generate pdf-dateien "hybrid", which the typical graphic display of adobe-formats at the elements of a table and a like text processing system. 
The cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be dealt with by various users mehrhändig, thereby avoiding conflicts in changes; in the case of the like text processing system will each assigned to a Frabe Bearbeiter in order to guarantee a better correction procedure. 
Some companies are in the process of different functions to publish on the Internet by openoffice (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the definitive result should be made public. 
The Italian version is at the following link to download available to it. At http: / / openoffice. Org / download / 3.0.0 / download300. Html. Consequently, the English version since Friday to the mirrors. 
And 'McJobs' Ausser for windows os is the programme for the operating system Linux available. 
In question, it could be installations-cd send home or go into office. 
However, freedom is the cost of a spur for the spread of programmes in the private households, so it is precisely in the area of the business, where openoffice could succeed in the big picture: finally, already different units of public administration and schools to openoffice. 
In fact there is not even a trainings- offer, which is an ideal aid for small and medium-sized companies, and therefore even business prospects. 
Openoffice is made up of five major components together with the word: Writer, artist treatment programme; Calc, the tables of programme, which aims to a displacement of high; Impress, to issue as Dbase Powerpoint presentations at the behest of databases, instead of the familiar access; and finally, a Grafikmodul draw an. 
The target for 2008, it is 1.5 million downloads to achieve a goal in already reached 3 million and 600 thousand also can be easily exceeded. 
Also tested positive for Kohl, the fourth Dopingfall. 
It has opened up a new Dopingfall spying framework of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Sports Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, as Drittklassifizierter and winner of the shirts of the best Kletterers. 
The news of the daily newspaper, l 'team published on their website. 
The 26-jährige Kohl by the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth drivers, the positive effect on the EPO Cera, the third generation, has been tested met. Previously for the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analysis from the blood samples are among those who Kohl in recent weeks from the laboratories were made and Losanna chatenay-malabry. 
Now confirm the Gegenproben Cera, the positive results on the Austrians will lose its third place and for two years by the race was excluded. 
The head of the French Antidopingkommission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest benachrichtige, and according to the associated press the Austrian competent. 
The 26-jährige Austrians, behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the Americans Cadel Evans on the podium and also claimed the Jersey for the best Kletterers. 
Issue of immigration: the New York Times asks: is Italy racist? 
Italy, "the former country of emigrants is one of the favoured countries recently for immigrants', which will be included with reluctance. 
This from the front of Belpaese a nation of racists? that asks the New York Times in a long rule that is the subject of racism in Italy and the case is devoted to the boy from Burkina Faso, Indian Abdul William Guibre, a month after he was murdered in Milan geklaut had a packet of biscuits. 
The case bears witness to what the times described as "a paradox of the North": the northern regions are those in which "the most integration and job opportunities' ', and yet the high degree of anti-immigrationistischen Sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega Nord, there has been". 
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants is calling the times to other episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome Ciampino and Castel Volturno, Parma. 
And not just that. 
The new legislation put forward by the league against immigration and to accelerate the deportation of illegal immigrants in Italy as a sign of change. 
A movement by the Pope and stress, "the President Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope during a meeting at the Quirinal is a collaboration between church and state to combat racism". 
Victims of the students up to high Mietspreise per room 900-euro 
The market for homes for the students knows no crisis. 
According to the latest investigation of the Sunia, the tenants Union, can a Einzelzimmer a students up to 900 euro in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 costs in Rome. 
"this phenomenon has already adopted very serious trains. Whole numbers of students so in fact lose their right to study because their families are not in a position to support them in this level" as the leaders of the Sunia, Laura Mariani "in these cities, the great demand from students to a adulteration of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants. 
It also include the majority of Mietangebote a number of offences: free contracts, lack of registrations, without housing price limit, impromptu under rent. 
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which in a review of the taxation to lower Mietpreisen. 
On closer inspection of the investigation reveals that in Milan, a Schlafplatz Brianza around 450 euros in the quarter needed; a Einzelzimmer begins with 650 euros (in the quarter ties Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter Lambiate Udine and Fiera, or even 900 euros in the quarter Vittoria. 
In Florence Schlafplatz costs an average of 350 / 400 euro, a room 700. 
In Bologna, where the students in the quarters at the University of focus, is 250 / 280 euros for a Schlafplatz of needs, 370 to 500 for a Einzelzimmer. 
In Rome, the prices in the quarters at the Uni, at about 600 euros for a Einzelzimmer, 450 for a Schlafplatz in a double rooms. 
Only a little deeper, the rents in the quarters about the other universities: 550 euro in Rome and Cinecittà Ostiense. 
Only those who shy away from in foreign counties can save money: 300 euros for a Schlafplatz and 450 euros for a Einzelzimmer, in Prenestina Centocelle and similar quarters. 
In Naples is necessary for a Schlafplatz 300-450 euro, for a room is the price between 400 and 600 euro in the most expensive quarters, and the Policlinico, Vomero Colli Aminei. 
In Bari costs a Schlafplatz 250-350 Einzelzimmer, one of at least 350 euros. 
In the smallest towns are the prices lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy. 
In the city, in which the phenomenon of property is more often in non-European students, such as in Perugia, there is even a further anomaly: a rents at 25-30% above the average of foreign students will be required. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinema close Multiplexkinos because of the beneficiaries. 
"a city without cinemas is a blind city, as a face without eyes." 
This image of the film director Giuseppe Tornatore in effect describes what is currently in the large urban centres of Italy, and in the provinces. 
The process of exclusion of cinema, with the birth of the great Multisaalkomplexe began in the periphery, in the long term, means the death for the Einsaalkino centre. A process, not just seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also the features of a cultural crime. 
Hit historic places are usually full of memories, "it is like losing a friend, which is a piece of streets full of emotions has come," as the director of the film "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, which gave him 20 years ago and Oscar moved the big price of Cannes. It is the story of a Vorstadtkinos and its nostalgia, what it is, in a good Kinowelt lost to live for ever. 
The figures, which the Anec, the central industry association provided a clear language talk: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas have closed; this bill for the most part paid the cinema in the main cities, 9: 10 in Florence, Bologna in Milan, Naples and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
One of the most badly affected regions include the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by the Toskana with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the Multiplexkinos, because it is precisely these three regions, in which the largest number of these modern cinema: registered with 195 in the last five years, the Lombardy in the lists, 81, both in the Toskana and in the Emilia-Romagna. 
"The business has developed in a irrational manner", so Paolo Protti, the President of the Anec, "while it is useful that new structures, but on top of the preservation of already existing because, includes a House in the city, not all of his captive customers are willing, instead of the old one Multiplexkino going in the periphery. 
And there is still the lack of budget for the Fund of the industry association äußer recorded eight: by the state debt stands at around 10 million euros. 
It is a shame from the ethical and moral position that the government is not the existing laws. 
In order to preserve the sector, would be between 16 and 18 million euros in the year of needs ". 
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, because of the fear to the old cinemas has decided to make these through an agreement between the Community and to protect the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy, the aim of the traditional cinema to protect and support, both in the historic centre, and in the periphery. 
Under the previous measures are also seen before tax Bevorteilungen for the Kinobetreiber and benefits to the public on the transport: it will be allowed in the traffic limited areas of the centre and also to travel to lower Parkgebühren to park. 
"It is a welcome initiative, as Giuseppe Tornatore, '' I hope that other cities will follow our lead and, moreover, still new approaches. 
Of course but we also need a better audio and Videoausstattung against the superpower of the Multiplexsäle can achieve anything, because it is the audience of today demanding. 
The defence of the traditional cinema for me is always an important issue: the closure of the '' by Supercinema Baghiera, place of my childhood and youth, was the pivotal point which brought me to the "Cinema Paradiso" nuovo, even though I have for 10 years had played with the idea. 
For 25 years, I live in Rome; when I look at the Rialto or the Quirinale vorübergehe in the via Nazionale, where I saw so many different emotions, I try to the side, so as not to see the staubbedeckten posters. 
The links between politics and the 'Ndrangheta leading to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
"the mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to make the decisions of the Community to adapt the interests of the Mafiagruppe Piromalli.. 
The accusations the bar of antimafia-behörde Kalabriens against the mayor Giorgio Dal and his deputy Rosario Torrione Gioia Tauro Schiavone, the municipality for involvement in the morning Mafiageschäfte were arrested, are severe. 
It was also taken in handcuffs Piromalli Gioacchino, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and whose nephew, the lawyer, irrespective of the same name as the boss of the clans, was already because the Mafia involvement in criminal groups, was sentenced to a Entschädigungssumme of 10 million euros. 
"any sort of moral and legal standard violation," the lawyers, "write the two local administrations had decided, the lawyer Piromalli money to pay for advisory activities." 
"It was therefore made possible the Mafiagruppe so the judges to enter via the official way in the halls and the policy of the public administration of human knowledge." 
The President of the Regional Committee Kalabriens Agazio Loiero denied that it in its region "anything other than an exception, on links from local administrations and organized crime. '' there are places, on what the concentration of mafia is greater than in others, in which such links are practically inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes, which is a perfect. " 
The arrests of those who follow this morning by the last July, which according to the police in the clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of the last April was the town council of Gioia Tauro already disbanded in 1991, but at the time and also because of alleged links between organized crime and local administration were the local politicians of their community have been posts. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then Mayor of the UDC, is in the run-off from May 2006 to the head of them centre-right coalition elected. 
He shouted scandal as the police ordered the disbanding of the parish council. 
He belangte Marco Minniti point in the Vizeinnenminister, have he invented everything from political and strategic reasons to explain. The judges but in connection with the arrest warrant this morning that the piromalli-clan had even dared to ask for a change in the a3-projektes. 
From a Abhöraktion in connection with the investigations into the case Dal Torrione, has shown a willingness to accommodate the wishes of a operator, which we know is a representative of the large group at the Piromalli is making the actions of the public administration coincide with the interests of the clans. " 
If the energy from the waves, are suddenly on the great 
It is a not versiegende source of money, what about 70% of the surface of the planet and only now that the big energy companies seem to understand the world. 
Tidal currents and waves are the new renewable sources of energy are all on the now, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron. 
The possibility of energy from the movements of the sea to win for 70 years, is already being investigated and take into consideration; not by coincidence more vigorous these studies since the first oil crisis significantly. 
As the price of oil in 1980 vergas to slow the idea of marine energy, but now pressing the environmental organisations and the increase in the price of oil on new impetus in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London, estimates that 15% of the world's energy of the energy produced by the ocean waves could be covered. 
This is double the energy produced by nuclear reactors at the moment. 
What would come in addition to the currents and tides. 
Giants in the attack. 
The first company, now on the marine energy, is Enersis in 2005 a treaty for the construction of a power plant in the north Portugal has signed. 
As this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step to act. 
Two years later, there are now more firms from the traditional energy industry, which for the marine energy production. 
"Chevron examines these technologies" as the spokesman of one of the American giants well-known company in the Wall Street Journal the possibility and will cooperate with us. " 
This is the creation of a licence from the American energy Commission needed a project to launch off the coast of Alaska. 
This is a not to be underestimated sign, particularly when you consider that just continue to fuel in Alaska is promoted by the United States and President Bush recently even the plans for new Bohrungen set in motion. 
In addition to Chevron are also the firms Verdant power Inc. from New York and Ocean power from New Jersey who invest in the new industry. Are also not familiar with the details, but observers speak of a rising interest. 
Still leaves technologies. 
Experts speak of a departure was still in the adoption of technology, not least because there is not yet the last doubt from the environmentalists are clarified. 
So far, projects such as the one in Portugal and Scotland seem rather small dimension and no serious ecological causing problems. 
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, we need technologies with far greater impact on the environment. 
There are various possibilities: Ocean power around uses a system of related Bojen. 
The boost of the waves, which moved up and down, Bojen within the swimmer will magically appear on Kolben and converted in hydraulischen pressure. 
This drives a Turbine, which in turn is pursuing a generator. 
The electricity will be on the coast under water pipes. 
Until now, there are four planned plant of its kind, which is still waiting for permission to the state. A part of its energy could also serve for military facilities. 
However, Verdant power produced already energy for a Warenkaufhaus and a Parklatz through unterseeischer turbines in the East river from New York. 
The water movements during the tidal forces turbines in which the emerging Drehbewegung feeds the generator. 
According to the Verdant waiting for a long queue of potential clients on the necessary Autorisierungen in order to make use of this energy sources. 
But the waves, then the tides. 
A particular interest, according to the Institute deserves the potential for stromgewinnungs research at the moment, which in the tides. 
Even though it is a phenomenon, unregelmäßiges are extremely unpredictable, but better than the tides, the sun Windströmungen and also of the waves, and therefore a trust more worthy source of electricity. 
It is the tidal energy, it is the federal states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal States, have already expressed about 7.5 million dollars to invest in 2008 for 2009 are already up to 35 million planned.
