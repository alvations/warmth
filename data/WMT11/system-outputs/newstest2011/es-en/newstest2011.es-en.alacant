What account? the čssd in Prague knows no or Voldemort neither the confectionery
The new councillors of čssd in the capital, will have to overcome the linguistic barriers evident to the components of the board of Prague and of the City Council to understand their renewed colleagues from the ODS.
The period aktuálně.cz "considered" to the members of the new Council of čssd to check their knowledge of the language marked slang that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when ran Prague the current members of the coalition.
The dictionary codified that used the Pearl policy of Prague during the previous period, the mayor Pavel bém, includes some of the characters, situations and cases more known of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been ascertained that the new councillors almost do not understand these known concepts.
At least, that they say.
" Who is? " Voldemort
"The truth is that I do not know. "
" Rather I am a novice in politics praguense, "said during the consideration of terminology of " colegueo" the councillor of culture lukáš kaucký.
And as regards the political veteran, reacted like Karel Březina.
Perhaps know the concept " hole of the golf course. "
" perhaps it is the only expression of all that I asked that I use occasionally. "
"If not, do not usually use slang."
The glossary, whose definitions published the newspaper aktuálně.cz last June before the Congress vote ODS, the Editor chose six examples, in particular those that are especially associated with the municipal authorities of Prague.
The Socialists had to explain the concepts " Voldemort ," " greatest golf hole of Prague ',' Go to the confectionery ," " nape of bull ,"" betrayal of the capital " and " shield ."
Three councillors accepted to subject to the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, which in future will be responsible for education in Prague, agreed to at the beginning, but he returned to pick up the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I am not concerned in these things or think to value how amuse the Civic Democrats."
"What I care about is how will understand us in the implementation phase of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, allegedly councillor lukáš kaucký had not realised that the previous title is an expression on an influential businessman and a friend of Mr. janoušek exalcalde bém, Roman.
To kaucký the word " Voldemort " he said nothing; the only word that hit in the review was the "golf hole largest Prague."
"It is the tunnel follow-up," says kaucký, which immediately added: "but rather as I know from the news. "
"I am going to have to focus on a language course," kid.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the hole in golf the tunnel follow-up, but also the environment councillor lukáš plachý.
Later, both sociodemócratas know who is really Voldemort and lukáš plachý even knows where to find this character; furthermore, suspicion the meaning of " go to the confectionery ."
"I think that means going to a company of Prague "; soon it uncovered to plachý that is the headquarters of the companies. Mr. janoušek
Like Březina, indicates that such knowledge obtained them of the news, but it did not use such vocabulary.
According to participants in the trial, including those sociodemócratas no glossary so familiar of colloquial terms.
"I asked my colleagues, but I really think we do not have anything like that. "
"Rather, we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make puns with the names," said the president of the čssd praguense, Petr hulínský, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
"In college I called bříza, but I do not know if my fellow also call me as well," confesses his own nickname Karel Březina.
The newspaper aktuálně.cz tested the name and works.
For their party colleagues, Weinert is děda (similar to "Yayo ") or less amicable, dědek (" old "), the representative and Miroslav, who partnered before elections deception during sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed" igráček " (" Playmobil ") by certain of his colleagues.
The nicknames are also the only expressions that sociodemócratas tolerate in spoke inside the party.
To hulínský does not like that he called Hulda, but the newspaper aktuálně.cz discovered even other nicknames for this president praguense.
" The doctor of the rights of the sweeps' apparently recalls that Petr hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the police academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of the witches, as published in a booklet
Women deemed witches burkinabé share certain characteristics.
Often elderly, may not work, for example, for reasons of health, are unmarried and have no children.
Women " return " witches is sent to a remote area, not to the detriment of the rest of the people.
" Men seldom suffer such but. "
"Neither isolates to the healthy young women, because they help in the work and have children," said a monk who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso is a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure ."
Issued a leaflet that should help to avoid the witch-hunt.
However, there is a fly in the ointment.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," warns the newspaper Die standard on the disadvantages of awareness by writing.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In wins, neighbouring country of Burkina Faso last week died ammy hemmah, 72 years, when three women and two men tortured it, covered it in petrol and burned.
The news appeared in the BBC.
The authors claim that was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was set on in the oil that is used for the ritual anointings.
Was in flames when the group wanted to "expel evil spirits' of women.
The isolation of the witches support people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a businessman 42 years of Burkina Faso: " devoradores of human souls always represented a danger, "he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government tries to appease the witch-hunt, in Gambia last year still participated in it the president.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide hunting of witches that, presumably, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the president himself through the Magic Negro."
"to help him brought to shamans from nearby Guinea, protected by the police, military and the personal bodyguard of the president, were to force to men and women chosen randomly between peoples Gambian property President in Kanilai," he noted in his report the organization Amnesty International.
In the estate, the persons arrested had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects which, moreover, caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of those arrested did not survive the stay at the farm.
After international pressure, finally freed around 1,000 people arrested.
The tenant of Bakala: heats stoves with coal and signing a higher rent
Men, elderly and robust, crossed the doors of customer services centre of the company's "RPG byty coal magnate " zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm was about documents with the new rental contracts 3-storeyed: yours, his daughter and his son, who is serving a sentence.
The three finishes them pillar liberalisation rents.
Instead 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the son will pay from next year 4,100 kroons by a flat of two stays with separate kitchen of second category.
"In addition, it has hot water and heating is based on a boiler of solid fuel," shows the finger at the man in the new contract his son, on whose signature has full powers.
" but signed it, "explains east angered, East resigned.
The civil association bytyokd.cz, that described the new conditions of rent as "incorrect and indecent," recommends tenants not to sign new contracts and to wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide to report on how to proceed in such cases.
But, before that, the man only last a demeanour.
" each said a thing, "he says with a bad side.
Ostrava is becoming a big laboratory evidence of liberalisation.
After new year will happen with the vast majority of the floors, in the Czech Republic, they were so far under a rent regulated.
Therefore, aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The waiting room minière RPG is one of four of Ostrava and, on Tuesday at 9 p.m., it was already full.
Just beside the doors are the security guards and at his side a machine to catch number.
" Renting 2011, "can be read in a luminous button of his tactile screen.
To press it, he leaves the machine a confetti with a number.
Almost no time or to read "157 " and already the number appears on the big screen at the top of the chamber.
In a second, you are in the queue.
, comes shortly after a marriage of age advanced to asking, but the crowd in the room is not here by the new rents.
The majority of people come to solve usual problems, as in the past: applications of arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of tenants of most of the 44,000 flats belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG byty proposes them in the letters A rent increase of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November it opens a special window in the centre of attention to the customer for the new rents.
"has been operating a week, so it is beginning," replied, after hesitating briefly, the workers who are in it when the client is presented as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the ancient flats for miners of Bakala are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, already treated them loud and clear to the Vice-President of Parliament, a native of Ostrava, lubomír zaorálek, čssd, and now appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
"Twenty years later, I want a new soil."
"Neither changed me the damned dish of Bath," desahoga the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to workers, for the time being nothing jubilados to see if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign in time, as it promises the special offer of RPG.
Also will receive half of the discount on the rental of February the remaining tenants to sign the new contract before the 15 December.
However, the window of the 'liberalisation' minière undoubtedly fails to dispel the doubts. Avalanche
'360 clients who were here yesterday, only asked for rent in 2011 around forty or fifty people, "finds the employee window.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes Web-based and their pieces make individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two sides fail to reach an agreement on the rent, they should solve the issue an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information on the only way possible and entirely according to the law," he warns on its pages. RPG
'here will not judge anyone, "thinks one of the RPG empleadas byty and one man found in the street in front of the customer services centre gives, at least in part, the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and remain me 5000 for the meal; I do not have the means to go to the courts," says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
" We will see ."
'Mr zaorálek warns them in ways that do not sign, so maybe people expect, "believes.
The rent regulation cease to exist in the majority of the Czech Republic at the start of 2011, and as RPG byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not cover even the amounts necessary to the maintenance of the fund to the community," recalls Pavel klimeš, director of the residential portfolio company RPG byty, who adds that the neglected state of the community anger that tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing rent.
Whereas during the five years between 2005 and 2010 could RPG with rents invest in apartments four billion, in the four years that Iran of 2011 to 2014, the number will increase to 5.2 million.
The big screen that hang from the ceiling, the seats in the waiting room, now repeats some data that highlighted in red.
" the rental increase in 2011 by 15 per cent and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is to say, more than 90 per cent of the properties. "RPG
"In addition, it will always be as maximum 7.50 monthly Czech crowns per square metre, " shown on the screen.
Only a 38 per cent increase in the rent of 400 flats portfolio of RPG.
"In such cases, it is an increase from some extremely low quantities, 19.66 kroons per square metre," indicates RPG.
In 2.600 floors, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG byty promises that liberalisation will not affect coup to rents, but escalará between four to eight years.
Furthermore, adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the graph) again in the flats, mainly in savings in heating: new windows and heating.
Will have priority the people to sign the agreement rising rent.
The architects have understood that offices also need playshool
The administrative building avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company arch.design.
Nobody would say also hides inside a small kindergarten with everything own to such facilities: walls of colours, movable creative and even a miniature park in the terrace outside.
Since October last year, they can attend the children of employees of arch.design.
The company of architectural projects arch.design, whose study left numerous buildings known of Brno, thought from the first outlines of the building avriopoint to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
In the company work around 90 people, mainly in the age of the baby boom, and wanted to allow the architects and delineantes would soon be able to return to work after maternity.
Along with the chance to enjoy a reduced hours, the centre is one of the benefits offered by arch.design its workers in the framework of the social agenda.
The constructors and architects in this way, they have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of the own employees of arch.designu and, with the support of the leadership managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Mini-kindergarten the company was financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the operational programme for human resources and employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (a total of more than 2.8 million koruny) could buy equipment and, after two years, recruiting qualified personnel and services.
When exhaust funding (two years), the company arch.design has an obligation to maintain the functioning mini-kindergarten with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the draft lasted a year, and in the presentation of the financing request contributed the enterprise economy rating.
The care of children in the hands of skilled personnel; in addition, they are present throughout the day for their care of a nurse and a lecturer at the Ministry of Education. The nursery is currently hosting children of any age, although most of them have less than three years.
Since that is a "mini-kindergarten ," can only host simultaneously to a maximum of five children, but with the turns many more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of the parents and children of all workers have the same rights to use the nursery, independently of the hierarchy within the company.
Although this is a lesson and individual cares, the content of the programme of the mini-kindergarten are comparable to the programme of the usual preschool education.
Therein children not only play, but also receive a quality education: since the basic learning until the preparation for the school, teach until spanish.1
The class not only provides toys and board games, but also of a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the own company creating an amicable and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children in any time and avoid the stress of collect afternoon children from college when he was far from his workplace.
So, parents are more productive while working.
Not surprising that this causes of natural form a relationship of loyalty between the worker and their employer.
Thus, arch.design stands between enterprises sign that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: support to the family and, ultimately, this programme increased marketing staff.
The House of the bones continues fascinando after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof seems the flank of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs recall column of a dinosaur and balconies seem the mouth of a fish open.
This is the House Batlló, in Barcelona, the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of his similar form to a skeleton, premises the apodaron "the House of the bones."
Its organic forms, their striking colours, use novel of the Stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade that reminds the flakes and all-encompassing curvadas lines mildly, this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaudí.
The gate of the House plays with oneiric lines, delicate colours and textures removed the nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, there is a some geometry, pace and a carefully thought order.
By the night, the entire front of the house seem even more impressive, since that is illuminated so that improve the shine of colours.
Meanders and the torque of the forms we remain surprising also in its interior.
Wavy timber copy mtefs windows, the rails, the embellishments of Gates, the peepholes and the signs.
Casa Batlló, which is in the district of Eixample in the number 43 of the lively commercial street of Passeig of grácia, emerged from the renovation of a house of the year 1877 of architect Emilio room polite.
Reconstruction lasted two years, and the house was completed in the year 1906.
The investor, the industrial Rico Josep Batlló, initially insisted in demolishing the previous building and start from scratch, but soon accepted the idea of Gaudí for a new reconstruction and cheaper.
However, the Casa Batlló, composed of various apartments, not designed Antoni Gaudí alone.
Collaborated in designing the architect Josep Maria jujol.
Of fact, in its levels of the project arose embellishments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
In the facade also workers other creators and artists.
Collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló it was the start of the successful collaboration of jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the House milá and the park Güell of Gaudí, that they are in the other parts of the same.
Due to his organic form, premises shortly after its completion the apodaron "the House of the bones."
Other, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it " the home of the yawns. "
It also said that, at the top of the building, the sword appears San Jorge, pattern of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hidden religious grounds.
Gaudí screened in the house a single system for the era of central heating with ventilation vents and chimneys. Typical
Can be strange its inclination of forty-five degrees.
During construction, Gaudí mtptc not at all construction standards of the time, and refused to be influenced by them.
Still, the construction obtained a permit from the beginning, although obviously in him the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, to this end, the city was so struck with the result that he requested corrected.
Bothered him, for example, that the construction included columns even until the public sidewalk.
The arrangements never realised, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the City Council, Josep Batlló requested (and received) permission to rent the top two floors of the building.
In the lower storeys moved the own owner.
In the gallery on the second floor was in the hall and on the third floor and the bedrooms the private part of the apartment.
The low plant rented to a jewellery.
The house, six flats, is entirely crossed by a stairway leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of reform consisted break all the angles and straight lines, covering them of curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connectivity of space.
The common part can connect completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can communicate in this way without any problems, without renouncing the privacy needed for talks more intimate.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new façade, but also an unusual roof and two additional flats.
It is impressive how plays Gaudí with the light, blue and white tiles covering the yard and skylights.
The game with two colours provides maximum light in all the floors of the house.
Was based simply on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colours, which rather absorb the rays of sun.
Any person can visit the Casa Batlló, that 2005 was added to the World Heritage list of humanity by UNESCO.
On the first floor of the house is the apartment more spacious and more heavy those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With visits confirmed, or discovered, it is a very beneficial business and expanded visits to the common zone and buhardilla, including the terrace of the roof.
The price of the entry to the monument is not insignificant, attains 16,50 euros, although students, pensioners and the owners of the tourist cards receive a 20 per cent discount.
The figure is considerably higher than the price of the entry of other buildings in the city. Gaudí of
If it wants to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with his towers of lizard, should be friend quickly some resident of neighbouring houses and visiting him at home.
How chooses the mattress and the somier: men and women are looking for different things
Nothing a framework pompous for bed; what really confers its quality at a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the somier.
Foremost should complement perfectly to suit the concrete users.
During the election many elements come into play, including the weight, height, gender and health status of the owner.
Is also important, the type of interior which puts the mattress and the somier.
A typical example?
For example, in a mud hut in weekend that often do not have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, considerably more often regret that the mattresses standingard pur-foam.
Therefore, it is necessary to get around them more often.
If not properly air channels and centre, above, are a firm basis, kept within the moisture. Even can appear mold underneath.
In choosing a bed, also influence customs.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad, often uses a very high mattress with a soft layer problems and will have to feel good on a lower surface and hard.
"Almost all of the hockey players who returned to the NHL complained that here not slept as well. "
"For pulverised their shoulders and hips, heels needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelástica."
"This type of mattresses also are recommended for people with diabetes to time problems of the nervous system, for which they receive bad information in the joints and skin," explains Sylva hadamcziková, which specializes in the padded furniture.
Many hockey players, like other clients, time-consuming preferring the mattresses of viscoelástica.
"Today there is no longer a problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and Italians Magniflex, but also the Czech Mark Tropico."
There is no longer be a player in the NHL to see the viscoelástica.
This "miracle" is a very simple way.
Optimise his rigidity and form, depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its Corporal heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not turns as after a hard party.
Simply, sleeps better.
The viscoelástica also works as a protection against the sores.
To choose the size of the mattress, added to his height the length its feet, that is to say, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm require a bed of between 210 and 220 centimetres.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of the individual rooms, for instance, of unmarried, recommends a minimum of between 120 and 140 cm.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, it can apply a standard simple to calculate the width: the lie supine, should take the comfortably shrunk hands towards the elbows ," advises the engineer Helena prokopová, expert of cechu čalouníků to dekoratérů, who already has been working for many years on the issue of healthy dream and the ergonomics of furniture, item that taught in specialist schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase needs attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to assemble the somieres at different altitudes, which it is not always possible in all the beds.
The mattresses of foam should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with interior docks least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetre are for the layer that adapts to forms and soften.
"to touch it with hand or to be accommodated in the mattress should certainly not notice the docks," warns Helena prokopová.
Each mattress requires a type of somier determined.
The entirely padded bedrooms, where the mattress and the base are as Siamese, meaningless in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe bad and cannot be washing its melt, which today does often.
And, since each night transpiramos between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years, the mattress will begin to remind us of a great (and crowded). Sieve
For this reason, the specialists refuse the slogans that talk about a life of the mattress of up to 25 years, or even a guarantee for life.
However, everything has a but.
Why sellers give a council: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, occupy carefully cleaning and hand-washing the melt, but better add a mattress protector that can withdraw and wash easily.
Although currently manufacture pillow mattresses with closure of zip around its perimeter, by the Open are two parties (something very important for washing and the size of a washing machine!), his manipulation in models larger (and for a single person) to lift the mattress can seem a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a somier, does a firm table?
Never!
As much to the beds designed to meet a night visits.
However, should make (if you have not already) vents in the table and needs to be used with a mattress with docks in the interior, with a minimum height of 15 cm with the docks in bags (as German taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Pur-foam the mattresses should not be used on such foundations.
For somieres no foils articulables and containing between 14 and 18 slats, can use latex mattresses or mattresses sandwich (for example, a combination of latex and coconut), although it is always better to a somier with a greater number of slats, 28 or more, where the plates of the lumbar zone are reinforced and can regulate its rigidity.
Somieres the foils articulables should not be used with a mattress docks, since it does not react to the reclinación.
In addition to the adjustment of the rigidity of the plates, it can also use the protection of the shoulders.
Is a special fixation of the plates that allows pressure, or even bend the slats so that "surround" very well the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have some very wide shoulders, it is something very important.
Even agree of them manufacturers of mattresses that in the " masculine ," began to utilize a softer zone precisely around the shoulders.
Also agree of women, in which they put a softer zone around the hips.
To customers more demanding, somieres exist with structure in Cruz or slat with the so-called multitorsión buffer.
The pressure is distributed between different points and recesses tension.
Must also take into account that, while using the mattress and somier suitable if employs a bad pillow (Grande and " mullida disappear "), most of the benefits.
The basic norm is simple: the pillow should sustain the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that they can relax the muscles.
The appropriate size recommended is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
To lie down, the pillow must be at the same level, when combined with the somier with reinforcement for shoulders or the softest zone of the mattress) to the height of their shoulders.
The modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original mattresses fillings of thatch.
Manufacturers still rely, increasingly often, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
Indeed, are fashionable the biological mattresses.
Raw materials basis of oil, with the manufacturer of polyurethane foam, are filled with natural oils, for example, or soya. Castor
Virtually all manufacturers known employ soya.
Biological-related ," in the case of the mattresses, mean that the centre is manufactured solely of materials of natural origin," explains Petr vašíček of the company Tropico plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the melt of the mattresses, one of the first aloe vera.
But we can also opt for the microcápsulas, untying a cool aroma to forest or lavender.
Differences also exist for men and women.
While men are " freshen " with vegetable extracts of breeze, for the mattress cover absorb heat and freshen the body, women prefer "heat" melt.
The extract of red pepper improves the circulation of the blood, so that women feel more warmth.
Does the favourites today?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure tailored cells, which makes them more permeable than normal pur-foam and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelástica allow to manufacture mattresses of various areas who know whither the head, shoulders and heels.
A mattress of good quality will cost him seven thousand kroner to above.
That play a therapeutic function typically have a lower VAT, since they are regarded as sanitary means.
The first obtained this advantage in the Czech Republic was gumotex.
Is complicated saving on mattresses and somieres.
Sometimes can approve program-offerings manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, brand offers Magniflex mattresses duofreeze with a foam with memory memory affiliated to the melt by 11.990 kroons.
The second achieves free.
Info-age viscoelástica with an open cellular structure and a great density began with the cosmic material " " Tempur.
Initially arose as material for NASA, because during takeoffs praise astronauts were subjected to a huge strain.
Tempur softens with heat and toughens with the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapted its pressure.
Therefore, is ideal to prevent sores, but also to improve the comfort during sleep.
The foam viscoelástica were not only used in mattresses but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that were placed under the legs and alleviate, as well as their movement.
The National manufacturers, for instance, use the foam eucatherm C or twinsaver and similar.
Increasingly parents employ tracking devices of people to control their children
Fear for children leads to more people think in control them by GPs.
The system, initially thought for monitoring vehicles, also can follow the movement of persons and thus contribute, for example, in a case such as the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl anička janatková.
By the time the device is approximately the size of a box of matches, but soon will reduce the size of a watch.
Many people gave him fear the case of the defunct anička and began to report on the means available to best protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading his privacy.
"All we are trying to tell us that this is not about spying, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy," considers Petr pilin of the company macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I acknowledge that, in certain cases, can abuse of such devices, for example, if you put in the bag of someone without his knowledge, but we have not yet met with such cases."
"The majority of customers really buy it for security reasons," adds pilin.
In his view, the children must always know what it is for the " cajita "and how it is used in the case of an emergency.
The child psychologist Dana bočková advierte on the fact that, if the child does not want to carry it, simply will throw it.
"Even younger children showed great creativity when deliberately lose certain things if you want to avoid that control them."
"Before, parents trusted enormously in mobile phones, but those could fade as easily as the productivity-knowledge follow-up," says bočková.
In his opinion, it is questionable whether, in the event of attack such device is truly useful.
"If it is a kidnapping prepared, the author almost always check whether the child is some kind of electronic device that might reveal his location."
"Now is the telephone."
"As extending the use of tracking devices, also seek, since its sale without doubt be conducted with great publicity .."
"In such cases, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, he added that such devices can help in the event of an attack. A paedophile improvised
According to Robert čech of the company RC monitoring, which offers follow-up services to both vehicles and to people, even if, after an attack, destroy immediately the productivity-knowledge follow-up, their presence can help.
"can configure the device sends regular position after a certain period."
"If suffers damage, at least facilitate the latest position of the person in question. "
" The most expensive devices carry a built-in measurer of inclination, so if the person simply slips and remains immobile, the device immediately issued a warning for the position in question, "says čech.
In his opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained even with the intelligent mobile telephones with navigation, in which should only install a special software.
The problem of units of current follow-up is that by the time it comes to devices with a similar size to a box of matches or mobile phones. Smaller
Therefore, could be lost.
As pilin of macro Weil, that is why we are conducting trials currently with devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage of having a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
" or identify it after a period of time, which can make the police win time, "it adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the doll or hanging, will continue to use the same technology being used to track vehicles.
This is to check the position with a GPS system, which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with a mobile phone that connects the current position.
The Army has enough fuses as for surround all the Czech Republic. But only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres fuse for setting explosives.
Last year the Ministry of Defence, added to his Arsenal 224 kilometres fuse.
Therefore, they have the stock to 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the fuse is two years, four at most.
The army bought the fuse for explosives to STV Group, A.S. by forty million kroons.
The staff of general responded to MF Dnes justify the purchase of such a large amount of fuse saying that soldiers needed for the training manoeuvres 60 kilometres of fuse annually.
According to the calculations of pyrotechnic the army, contacted MF Dnes, it was decided, however, that, in such a case, they should make those manoeuvres with frequent use of explosives each year also all generals, officers of high command and, even secretaries and cleansing.
Licence-exempt wanted nor defence minister Alexandr vondr and army captain. Vlastimil Picek
Only thus could justify that the Army spent sixty kilometres of fuse.
Such length equates to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as the experts say, to the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two metres fuse, the army would be with the new purchase (including adding consumption of the engineering units or special) enough for stocks mentioned above. The 225
Soldiers from the brigade for rapid intervention complained personally does little to the Minister Vondra because they say that they are barely ammunition for various weapons, which are therefore limited even shooting practice as a matter of money.
And let us not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also understand that buy us iteratively such quantities of fuse. "
"But it is their decision, and certainly know why act as well."
"For us, the army is a good client that I, as a company, we are trying to meet," admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometres of fuse saying also that will take stock of this "ammunition" as a minimum for ten years.
However, Jan děcký, STV Group, indicates the fuse only has a lifespan of four years, and in the case of pyrotechnical products for the army or police, of two years.
"If stored in some perfect conditions, it can take up to four," said one of the soldiers who, by the criticisms of the army does not want to give his name.
After the end of their life, each carefully ammunition should be checked to see if he is still a reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the ministry is the buy 445 kilometres fuse, obtained a discount.
"cost us a 60 per cent less than the request for the past year of 244 km," said the spokesperson pejšek of the shopping centre, the Ministry of Defence.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of fuse of pyrotechnic the police removed the unexploded munitions from the second world war or of the left by the Soviet Army, there already exceeds years ago the 1,500 metres.
Besides, the police always asks only the just quantity as to exhaust the ammunition before the end of its useful life.
Decided it for security reasons for the pyrotechnical, and also meanwhile can achieve types of fuse more modern and reliable.
The ministry already has clear difficulties in closing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition at the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak Army of Two hundred thousand people were preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According with the pyrotechnical speaking MF Dnes, after a couple of years it will have the following problem with the present: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometres of old fuse, which is buying now " cheap ."
Until now still living through the contacts that achieved thanks to concurso
The fact win the competition "Entrepreneur of the year " helped lukáš pytloun in selling franchises his hotel.
The last edition, won the competition "Entrepreneur of the year 'The enterprising exception-rule lukáš pytloun of Liberec.

My successor wish him a calmer year that we have had in farmet
The euphoria of victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, is it possible that farmet already past the worst.
The owner of the company, Karel farmet žďárský, received the first prize in the latest edition of the competition of Vodafone "company of the Year" last year in the " Slavic house "in Prague.
The jury appreciated their efforts, which failed to convert a small technical workshop in Česká skalice in a signature with a volume of business of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the prize had not only encouraged me to me, but to all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition," said the winner of the last year.
The history of the company farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
That is why, when the state proposed the father of Karel žďárský rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of properties during communism, not doubted too; resigned from the company that worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of piles of plastic.
Shortly after, began to specialize in vegetable oil. Presses
Eight years after it became the largest manufacturer of automatic press from the centre of Europe.
Obtained greater presence also among the no specialised public after achieving success in the contest in the media.
" not just our customers, began to consider the brand farmet as considerably better, but also to the foreign partners began to value collaboration with a firm that obtained greater success in his country, "says Karel žďárský.
Last year perhaps farmet was not only a sign of the euphoria of victory.
Was also recognition for the commercial results to the year 2008, and partially, 2009.
And precisely the year 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached many citizens, respiratory-cardiovascular that companies detained their investment projects, and began to limit the purchase of new engines or engine technologies.
"We, obviously, neither rid us of this situation."
'income is reduced by 40%, we have had to limit the production and even had some redundancies, "explains Karel žďárský.
A viable company must, at times, even unpopular. Adopt measures
However, controlled the situation and kept the profits of the company, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where farmet cut expenditure was not in the field of research and development.
"With the subsidies have constructed a centre for research and education, we reinforced presence in the international market and obtained glorious assessments in national fairs," says žďárský.
Everything indicates that already have left the crisis behind.
Income again, and with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement expect aporte a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel žďárský.
A survey that reveals the ridiculous norms
The survey of absurdity of the year is part of the tournament for the fourth time. Business
Has already been eliminating some ridiculous norms.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the survey absurdity of the year was the obligation of bringing the administration documents for staff can access online.
The decision adopted by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of the social security called an extract of the commercial register, although its officials can get with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech administration of Social Security because it will not seek an extract of the commercial register when cconduct control of the impositions of the insured," declared the spokesman for čssz Jana buraňová.
The goal of the survey absurdity of the year is to consult the standards and rules which must be respected by companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to try and to remove those that are absurd.
Form this year for the fourth time, the part of the business tournament the publication hospodářské Noviny and begins to create fans also amongst the general public.
While the editing of last year, with the participation of three thousand voters, this year virtually reached four thousand.
And not surprising, given that we still have legal obligations several well that simply must be respected to trade.
" Perhaps in number of roles required for declaration of taxes we are in first place of the world, "said Karel havlí * Ek of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic.
Years ago, the simplification of the business norms is a stated objective of all the governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement, especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for a company, the Czech Republic is in the position 74th, i.e. eight posts worse than last year.
The contest absurdity of the year is being held for the first time in 2006, and every year the same way. Is repeated
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when it closed the contest.
The proposals can be made at the Web page www.firmaroku.cz. later, the organiser of the contest selects seven candidates for "antipremio" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
Wins the absurdity that receives more votes.
To the survey this year, there were more than a hundred, including 105 rules and regulations that are meaningless.
The examples sent them both entrepreneurs as professional associations and journalists.
Between "finalists" the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles to the maintenance of roads and motorways pay the toll or that employers with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint every two years the walls.
The list of seventy proposals this year was published in the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which is always made in early November in Wenceslas Square, Prague, as part of an event that usually participate in the personalities of the political and social world.
This year, for example, attended the contest glcs svobodová this act, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs from the Czech Republic, or Petr kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
" economic prosperity cannot continue if the state puts him continuously barriers to entrepreneurs, so my aim is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs currently unnecessarily complicate trade, "announced the Minister of Industry and Trade. Martin Kocourek
Efforts to eliminate the absurd regulations does not fall by the wayside.
In the year 2007, which more bothered people was the duty of the employer to communicate with a notice of three days at the business office of the zone of permanent operation, intend to go with a post to a fair or exposure.
This obligation be eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended up in second place in terms of the number of votes in 2007, that is to say, the Commission communication to the office to work for part of their foreign workers working travel for up to 30 days was removed in law the so-called green card.
And third time lucky.
The absurdity of the year 2009 was the regulation for the physiotherapists having in its consultation a large mirror, a fridge and two scales of soil.
That is why, this year, the Ministry of Health issued a communication by saying that it had removed the obligation to have a fridge.

The police conducted arrests during a public auction in the building of the agricultural fund, in Pilsen
Anti-corruption police conducted various arrests in the building of the agricultural fund in the past few days.
The detectives was handcuffed to a local businessman in the media sector and to the real estate entrepreneur Luboš G.
Apparently, this try to manipulate a public auction in course for restitution of rights so that the ground auctioned received it a concerned precise.
Must pay to Luboš G. East million crowns.
"For the moment I can only say that the police search a person for bribery during a public auction and bidding právo," he told the chief of the attorney general of Pilsen Antonie zelená, adding that by the time it could not disclose further detail on the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police spewed businessman 46 years.
On the way that could influence in the public auction, given the little official information, so you can only speculate.
The spokesman of the agricultural fund lubomíra černá responded to questions of právo saying that the police carried out really the arrest at the headquarters of Pilsen, and it was during a public auction.
"It is a customer, not one of our employees," said.
As černá, the public auction called "invitation for the submission of proposals for the transfer of land in accordance with the law on the earth," and is being carried out at a number of interested parties in relation to the ground offered.
"These persons, during the call, they offer more than the value of his restitution, which must be transferred before the announcement of the value of the ground. "
"On the basis of tenders, determines the order of buyers and, then, the agricultural fund transferred the ground to the person who provides the greatest supply " explained the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to submit to the collection and, given that it is also a person of interest because it purchased various rights of restitution, proposed to stakeholders on the ground that it would not participate in the auction.
By such favour, was gaining a commission.
This explain that, at the time of arrest, have so much money.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the heart of Pilsen long.
Appeared in the case of the former head of the PF Václav sankot, which was charged for dismissing the replacement of land for whom already had issued a decision construction.
E.g. Luboš G. just obtaining some planned terrains of the fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular, in the place where they should build a big road to the industrial zone of borská pole.
Later, changed them very beneficial to the magistrate for a house in the historic centre of the city with a value much higher.
In this case, the City Council had to intervene because, if not, the land blocked avoid construction.
The families will have to pay additional costs of several hundreds of crowns per month
Households will have to pay since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, by heating and, in some cases, rents higher.
Therefore, families will have to learn of the portfolio, as of January, several hundred krónur per month more than now.
The price of electricity increases at 4.6 per cent, the gas around 2 per cent in some cities will have to pay up to 10% more to the supply of water, and many also increase the price of district heating.
Rising electricity for families living in apartments should amount to approximately SEK 100 more the year now.
However, major suppliers of electricity reduced prices, because of increasing the support to the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular the photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderately more expensive, especially in the time in which more used heating and therefore greater is consumption.
In this case, it should also have a couple of hundreds of top more annually.
While gas and electricity are all over the country, a change in the price of the central heating varies.
Rising price schedules it mainly the largest municipality.
For example, households of Pardubice or of Hradec králové paid since January by the central heating about 50 top over the month, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns per year.
Residents in Prague should also bear an increase of 9 per cent of the price of water and heating, especially in the event that the city increase the rent infrastructures.
If the lease does not vary, the praguenses paid 6.8 percent additional.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, the two rates was a 7.4 per cent rise.
Can greatly increase rent prices 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where the regulation is to be completed in January.
For example, the company CPI byty possesses in Usti nad Labem some 2,500 flats, increase the rent since January by up to 100 per cent.
The company will take the courts to those who do not agree with the new lease.
Rents regulated, that benefit residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase next year by up to 10 per cent.
Young Czechs they were drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because slowly effect
Fernet, rum, vodka and even whiskeys good stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that cause finish in young medical cares drinkers with a lower age to fifteen years.
The children who end up in the hospital left continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This stems from the experience of the doctors who are with such cases in the admissions of paediatry the hospital.
"drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take much in emborracharles."
"Now fashion are the strong alcoholic drinks " indicates právo to the head of pediatrics at the hospital hořovice in the centre of Bohemia, luděk Pelikán.
"When they take him a bottle to his father in the cupboard, that may be, but whisky is usually of Fernet and vodka. "
"vodka has the advantage that lightens with juice and that does not smell," explains. Both
Confirms this also the spokesman for the University Hospital motol, glcs jurinová.
"Normally, they are typically Fernet or Rum. "
" These are the modern alcoholic drinks, particularly among schoolchildren. "
"In some cases, use eau-de-vie that took in house," adds jurinová.
According to the chief Pelikán, are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years that often appear in hospitals.
Before hořovice, where works from this year, he worked for a decade in paediatrics in motol, where ambulances carried young people from nearby areas.
" A girl had to enter perhaps four times. "
"began at age 12, when brought it with 3.5 blood alcohol in addition to a mixed with ecstasy," said the department's medical on this case.
"was at the fair of holešovice in some party of dancing. "
"What is interesting is that his mother nor surprised him that his daughter disappeared 48 hours ," is surprised by the chief.
Is precisely the lack of interest of the parent or even his clear tolerance towards drinking by their children, which is seen as the main cause of increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts say that, in the case of children, it is not possible to talk of dependence. Immediate
" alcoholic to a person who has a chronic dependency of alcohol for several years, with all of the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children. "
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it should be a social environment or family failed systematically," explains head Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson jurinová, this year at the Clinic pediatric motol is hospitalizaron until mid-November Forty boys drunk.
However, statistics only show those that come with a grave intoxication and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers, after the mobile medical check-up, they are going home with the parents, or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink firewater, for Pelikán there are three seasonal variations that include: the witch day, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, drink by the bad notes or, on the contrary, are celebrating the start of the holiday. "
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions until seven children drunk at the time," adds Pelikán.
The drinkers who spend the night in detoxication under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage of the next day are not a terrible hangover at home.
The morning headache recovery-induced dehydration and lack of glucose, avoids with the injection of a serum with glucose and with nutrients that lacks the agency.
" They are a lot better because, after the troubled night, Rose well and not hurts them nothing. "
" Only show confused as to where they are, "says Pelikán, adding that often, patients lose the good humour at least when they see the costs that they have generated.
Outposting in ambulance and hospitalization in a room for grave patients comes to cost a dozen thousands of kroner.
"I have often used the cost as a means to educate, when the visit I say directly to children how has cost his drunkenness and that they would have to spend the whole summer on a work for young people so that won enough to be paid that night," adds Pelikán.
Medical insurance, in his view, perhaps as regressive measure, which typically return to the people the cost of treatment, it does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two aircraft L-159 are for the first time in extraneous hands in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 of a total of five, by the Ministry of the Czech defence replaced the plane home C-295M, split on Tuesday to Seville, which is the manufacturer of the aircraft home - EADS.
Is the first time that a device of this sort is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the moment, only were abroad for flights of practices or demonstration.
This is the version biplaza l-159t1 that so far used the Czech army and that it was still in a state of fly.
The three remaining aeroplanes are monoplaza L-159.
They still conserve in AER Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company omnipol, already took care of them the week.
Jan peješk, of the press department of Defense, said that it is not yet known when it will retire the aircraft Vodochody physically.
"aeroplanes monoplaza L-159, in contrast, they were separated from the planes repaired long ago, without investment or additional input from the ministry. "
"biplaza l-159t1 exchanged in its current state," he told právo pejšek.
Added that the army is not without biplaza aircraft, since in May 2009 the Army signed with AER Vodochody a contract in an amount of 200 million for the construction of four devices L-159 biplazas unnecessary.
One new aeroplanes already received it the Army in July, the other will be handed over at the end of the year.
As pejšek, EADS pledged that the aircraft add the equipment of some allied countries.
"In the contract clearly indicates that the company is EADS that cut the Jets L-159 and that will serve to practices of pilotos of NATO countries."
"Therefore, it is up to the buyer to decide how you are going to use in this context," said pejšek.
The newspaper hospodářské Noviny published ahead of time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
Exchanging five L-159 by a plane home and the purchase of three other aircraft by 3,500 million crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not summon a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current direction of defence claims that the Exchange promotes the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army acquired AER 72 aircraft and only utilizes 24, by which it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft home possibly arrive to have legal consequences.
The European Commission already reported to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft conducting a European bidding and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army already received three aeroplanes home, and the last should arrive at the airport praguense of kbely in fourteen days.
An index finger longer than the annular indicates a lower risk of suffering cancer
Men who have the longest index that the annular are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
That is the surprising conclusion of a studied published on Wednesday in a British magazine on cancer.
Could depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone,.
"Our findings suggest that the length of the finger can constitute a simple proof of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men with ages of up to 60 years," said the co-author of the study Professor Ros Eeles, of the Institute for Cancer Research, at the University of Warwick.
Therefore the finger could help to identify men should undergo a test for prostate cancer, in particular if this feature was associated with a genetic risk or other negative factors, such as family health problems, according to Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, undertook the follow-up with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic finger of the right hand shorter than the annular.
Displayed the same likelihood suffer prostate cancer that 19 per cent of those whose fingers are the same length.
In the case of the men with an index longer than the finger cancel, this risk was reduced in a 33 per cent; for men with inferior ages to 60% reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones which are exposed the foetus in the matrix.
A level of testosterone less corresponds with a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech genetista and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav pačes, told čtk that knows the study, but that he did not believe that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer can "prove altogether ."

Certainly, you cannot use a normal protection and, when it launches his rain murderer of metallic chips, could prove crucial in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for infantry which uses a technology "smart."
" Soldiers manipulate it so that the goal, serve the same its laser beam which determines the distance, afterwards obtains a precise sight and, depending on the same, corrects the line of screening and pulls the trigger. "
"say that have measured 543 metres. "
"When it presses the trigger, the gun was loaded and Lanza the projectile at a distance of 543 metres, more least one, two or three metres," said Audette.
Move 400 jobs
The Fujitsu consortium raises its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees change its workplace of their previous office building in the marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg the Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported the sector giant specialized computers and their maintenance Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year in his former office building in marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg the Astro Park, a large office complex lyoner Straße in the street in the neighborhood of niederrad, in Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that in the medium term other 100 employees more of the consortium, which had previously been found scattered around the region, will lodge there.
Supply is highly attractive, further the collective office in Astro Park will support the work of employees.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner stated, "in franfkurt-niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new relocation of a major company in the region led to yesterday joy between those in favour and disappointment among those that were against.
The head of section of economy of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that it has won a " global player ."
This is a "wonderful recognition to the site."
-generally- Fujitsu in the city, the settlement is a major boost to niederrad.
The mayor of bod hombruger, Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regrets the decision. Fujitsu
FDA informed prior to the city about his intention.
"Of course we have offered to the enterprise our help," he declared. Korwisi
However, the good contacts of the manufacturer of computers with the owner of the property in marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
In the end, the economic reasons producieron the fall.
In such a way, there is now a big empty place that cover in the position famous.
"I hope the owner and the lessor of the building show cooperative. "
Inmueble the previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring " Kleine vertikale "formed part with the excess buildings of marienbader Platz from 10 years ago of a controversial project to build the city. Spa
As a joint project of the city and a private company projects between the station and the city will form a new entrance to the city, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and in terms of the level of buildings.
In 2001 have installed cpem investment and adjusting firms, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, start Amadeus, as well as then joined Siemens with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche immobilien-chancen-gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate, and a year later resold to Hispaniola Falcon real estate investments SA in Madrid.
The consortium Fujitsu, a native of Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global supplier of it.
Secretary-general.32 enterprises, for example of computers and servers, and also provides the precise services.
The branch in rhein-main-gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, of all ways Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions installs from Bad Homburg in frankfurt-niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name of TDs.
Why have rented 7,000 square metres in the office building of star Park.
The ancient complex of the 1920s, its name refers to his plane with a star among other, is home to the Central Association of electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon cancels the server - threats against Assange
Anguish descends increasingly WikiLeaks.
The Internet service provider Amazon has removed the platform of revelations of his server.
Possibly behind find political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly arrested in England.
The platform of revelations of Wikileaks is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to his previous American server and currently seeking a homeland of the Internet in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, and called on other countries and companies to boycott. WikiLeaks
And the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people wanted by Interpol, should be held in detention in Britain, according to one article.
"Expelled WikiLeaks server Amazon. "
" talk freely in the country of freedom ," the activists communicated revelations through the courier service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed documents from WikiLeaks its server.
Internet activists had resorted in the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Web services Amazon to cope with the high figures of access to documents.
Through Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: " Perfect, will allocate our dollars to employ people in Europe. "
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, " should stop selling books. "
Amazon stopped the use of its server through WikiLeaks, after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman had requested investigations, reported CNN as a call to the office of Lieberman.
The presidency of the Council of the Senate for the security of the country had loomed on Amazon with boycott, informed the British "Guardian."
" had liked Amazon take these measures before, before the previous publications of classified information by WikiLeaks, "declared the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also forbade in other countries the use of the server.
"The illegal process, monstrous and inconsiderate of WikiLeaks puts our national security at stake and threatens life in the world," it said in a communiqué from the independent senator.
"Any responsible company, either American or foreign, should assist WikiLeaks with its service to extend material stolen.
The founder of WikiLeaks, Assange is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the list of wanted persons Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, "the Australian 39 years has been arrested in Britain, Scotland Yard know the exact place.
The Internet activist has consistently rated research in Sweden as a tapestry of its enemy.
The spokesman for WikiLeaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, said in London that have been threats.
" There were even calls on a murder of Julian Assange. "
That is why there are fears for the safety of Assange claimed Hrafnsson.
Therefore, still without reveal the location of the founder of WikiLeaks.
Hrafnsson reacted obviously before the statements of America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, said the responsible of WikiLeaks' revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, said an adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, on television, "Assange should be killed" and Obama might use a "drone."
Between the White House and a big dispute. Assange crece
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for the American president, Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, in the case that she is responsible for ordering diplomats to recently that involvement in spying activities.
"I am not quite sure why we must import the opinion of a kind, with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of the country are much stronger than its website. "
The American government has to show the effectiveness of the protection of its databases generally.
Russell Travers, deputy director for the distribution of the national counter-terrorism centre, was appointed exceptional attendant announced the White House.
By what Travers is responsible to develop " important structural reforms, which are necessary in the light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information on the government and to protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that in order to provide for the security of dissidents and activists, should jeopardise the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything possible to get in contact with them," said the State Department spokesman, Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
University of freezing
In "gelato University in Bologna" prepare heladeros in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
In reality, all the ice cream comes from where?
Of gelatiere and gelataio.
The gelatiere produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of preparing freezing.
The gelataio Saca with a espátula the cream of freezing the counter, extends on the barquillo and sells it.
To know this, we do not need to go to Anzola Dell Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about freezing, should not visit the "gelato University " Carpigiani, an Italian company.
The manufacturer has instrumented to the University of the chilly the congeladora in 2003, so that the cream of the freezing of their machines reaches the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course of three days for future heladeros has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses more days on the freezing of chocolate and practices in the ice cream parlour of home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, other risk in the soft freezing its vague desires.
This time are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary.
To Jacky, professor of this art of California, loves him the slow movement of food in the future and wants to offer a European product quality in the land of industrial freezing.
Anke, of Berlin, is asesora companies and wants to create something own in some years within a work. Aggravating
Two Egyptian youngsters dream with opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man of Malta and another Brazil want to improve the quality of the freezing of its pubs, and a master of Canadian house, Julia, comes because their children love them the Italian ice creams.
The master heladero Luciano Ferrari explained to participants subsequently the ideal qualities of the freezing perfect.
Is not decisive only his good taste but also their softness sedosa and his good consistency.
Luciano no olvida their training or the deck of cream of the national upper house, mainly in the south of the country: " The Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that is why each ball has something romantic. "
The first step to drafting seems all too easy.
Luciano misses the basic ingredients: milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a great batidora, heat everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and the time the cool until four degrees.
Then opens the tap of the machine and leaves a basic cream pasteurised White, the basis for all kinds of freezing of milk.
Suddenly, Professor question: may the cream of freezing can be developed only with natural elements or without estabalizador?
How can unleashing some keen to experiment?
Luciano advises that 'minds on the job of the trends of the time.
Which spoke of freezing " not only natural ingredients ," probably has used stabilisers, mainly a natural product, probably Goma guar, guar Bean.
Of course we can elaborate freezing without stabilizer, you only need to buy one day, put in a bag and the customer will bite an audible freezing of granite.
Will permit variations in the basic mass.
Flavourings are used.
Regarding the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes the ingredients which buy section of fruit or sweets of the supermarket.
Moreover, there are powders and pastes.
"All providers will try to foist aromatized ingredients in their wares. "
"nevertheless have to experience once. "
Either with sherbets of fruit with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the cream of freezing the white basic mass with eggs, which will be a yellow cream and cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now participants of course can use the heladoras.
Luciano leaves them develop anthere four different types of ice cream in vanilla, chocolate, and MOCA hazelnuts, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less scent of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
Carried out the same experiment also with types of freezing of fruit.
Know better not necessarily depend on having more aroma of tofe or more fruit purée.
It is not necessary for the freezing hazel-nuts SEPA to nuts, if contains more hazelnuts.
The working group produces the adored freezing of kiwi fruit, using more fruit, less water and less of stabilizing.
First a balanced blend highlights the taste of ice cream, he said. Luciano
Developingproducing freezing is a problem of artimética: the peach purée with a lot of sugar, we must reduce the proportion of sugar the basic recipe.
For the freezing of Limón requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano Saca a utensil with which sets the amount of sugar on the types of fruit (measurement of winemaking for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately the tables provided the account.
Develop freezing not require more than the physical application, as before.
Not only help the utensil for the automatic preparation of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which beat simultaneously mixture of freezing prepared and cools to temperature below zero.
Despite everything, the entire automation remains outside regarding the small paste.
Brazilian Gustavo marks himself and his colleagues from the top down with fruit purée, as if it were a giant miniprimer without control.
"In all classes," says the teacher Luciano, " it is only a matter of time that passes something. "
Inspectors in a situation complicated
The European Food Safety Authority EFSA has infiltrated in the industry which is experiencing with transgenic plants.
Currently this matter as the panel of experts testbiotech, considered an institute to the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
" seems a conspiracy theory, but we have not well documented, "said Christoph then, director of testbiotech Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the group of experts from EFSA on genetically modified crops, and another expert of EFSA are also recruited from years ago in the Association ilsi.
The consortia as Monsanto, or Nestle Bayer pay it.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in standards income-testing EFSA of genetically modified plants, which placed him in a clear conflict of interests, then criticises.
Provisions of EFSA are at paragraphs with the same terms with the documentation of the situation of ilsi and imitate script of the company, which in reality is controlled by the Italian authorities in Parma.
Is the second time that testbiotech criticises a collision of interests.
So, recently, a senior manager of EFSA was without the support or the time for transition to Switzerland agrarkonzern Syngenta, and it has changed his side. With that
Recently, also Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the authorities of the EU inspectorate and industry, conducted by the general office of the environment as well as a parliamentary clear-eyed EU.
However, EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interests.
Resorts to all the formal data, also to some of the industry, as long as they are of a high technical quality, and are managed in a report.
Is not required for the experts working in EFSA not have any contact with the industry.
But should expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the international Life Sciences Institute (ilsi) in USA
Called himself as a neutral forum to experts and science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without ordering lobby.
In this item, independent experts, as then, criticise that currently allow transgenic plants without investigating food to animals, and that does not check the influence of the genetically modified crops into the environment.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize in agriculture," says then.
The current practice is to verify only proteinas isolated, but not the entire transgenic plant, which offers reliable results.
"If not seeking the risks, how they are going to be?," he asked, accuser, then.
Angelina Hilbeck believes in the same way.
The scientific investigates since 1994 the field of genetic engineering and is currently working on the technical institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is attempting to increasingly, in the US and in Europe, to influence or discredit scientists critics.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, the critical studies are not published by general rule.
"Industry controls the investigation of security ', maintains Hilbeck.
Trace the stones
Uli gsell has achieved some, in total around 400 kilos.
Monday was before the station Stuttgart, with the tuba to the backs.
Demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is well known: in September, bulldozers and started to demolish a big piece of the north wing.
Land of Stuttgart was never to be the same: thousands and thousands marched against the S21, suspension of millions in the season.
As was tagged, the greater part of the wing is hizó rubble.
Rotates at 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer muschelkalk, a soft stone Rugova, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell sculptor is in ostfildern, has 43 years.
Has ensured a couple of pieces.
" These stones are relics. "
Must not disappear. "
Excites: " a cheap and poor stone, simple and natural. "
As once said, has smelt the smoke from cigarettes.
Still do not know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli gsell also.
Trace the stones of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous ammunition depot of the French Navy, where Manuel Rongen erected his stone stein-reich.
The man 44 years trafficking with ancient stones.
Has bought everything resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"have dishonoured, would grind the gravel or sent to the dustbin," says in her office, a little wooden house which was once a booth guard.
Abused him and threatened, explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, which had bought the remnants of the north wing, to the company of demolitions.
The spoke with the enemies of the 21s for several days.
And he explained to them that I could not do anything for the demolition.
And when it happened, then was the more reasonable, when the stones to be used.
About 200 enemies of S21 took the mazizo 80 kilos Cortado, with a price of $6.50 per piece at €14.
Some took it as I remember but also with the hope of being able to return in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, a burden of 25 trucks.
Roughly half is still in the forest, the rest a long time ago that was sold.
Dueño of gardens, landscape gardener, commissioned projects.
Came from all sides and what could be in the boot and excess.
The stone of Stuttgart impetus long ago, that has become "the Wall," or in the delimitation of kräuterbeeten.
This stone "in reality, it is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it were not for the political component."
Amounts to his SUV, a tour by his great kingdom of 20 hectares.
Studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And lover is throwing.
Lodges to 4,000 tonnes of stone.
Transports his treasures across Germany.
Said to be the largest ancient stones dealer.
Slows.
In snow there are stones artistic sandstone hammered.
Pertencieron "the bridge of Dresden marienbrücke," explains.
Limestone Alba, yellow, warm, excites.
" My dear stone. "
The path crosses the forest.
Notes a lot: red sandstone, a previous piece of the station of Karlsruhe.
And follows.
" Beautiful travertino. "
Formerly the mazizos belonged to the rostrum of neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
By all parties in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertino police headquarters Stuttgart, red granite of the church Sankt Blasien, Toba Heilbronner hospital.
What Labour, which effort, which sweat.
When Rongen thinks of as esculpió before the rocks and moved them with a simple bottom-rigging and a cart, feels very worshipper.
" It would be a scandal if something to be destroyed. "
Has not been done Rico, immensely rich. Absolute
But today 14 Persons gave to the dealer of stones, stone masons, also a sculptor, A Smith, a vidriero and a gardener have installed arrive in the forest.
"We worked hard, but it is satisfactory," says the man who is responsible for the remains. Take
Shortly must go to Cologne.
There, too, there are stones rescue.
Fight talents around great potential
Queen an active influx in the buffet.
16 students bank around the buns, the tomato soup and candy.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the manufacturer of Vokswagen cars have been invited to a workshop to students in mechanical engineering and design.
In a kind of competition in ideas, have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Rivalling and in the same way, many companies, including VW, are meeting in a fight duel around minds more privileged in partnerships with universities.
Their mission: to quickly recruit pupils with more talent from universities, before they enter the labour market and are employed by others.
And as universities not facilitate publications on the skills of its students, are trying to see with the exceptional talents in practical projects and attract them.
The second day of the draft in the Technical University of braunscheig, the consortium wins the talents.
A miss the personnel department delivers pens, gomitas and folders with the VW logo.
Explains to the young talents with excitement programmes and the work of students and shows them his ways in the consortium.
Nico seal of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
Sees advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience. "
"In turn, can know VW students, to look more closely at the candidates interesting and as prospective workers."
Some collaborations, said seal, are not rare.
The novelty is that students are very directly. Desired
"The main point previously found in the technical projects," says seal.
The fight by fresh graduates is becoming tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees between a large group of applicants.
If not that they have to be announced and, above all, to achieve a highly qualified workforce.
All students of the engineering disciplines are in a good situation for negotiation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI by their acronyms in German) in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, according to the prognósticos the VDI, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the company of auditing and advisory KPMG, Roman dykta is responsible for hunting of talents.
Organisedorganized costly recruitment events, such as the career KPMG, a kind of modern yincana where the participants have to find their way through the coordinated GPS.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the United States the following year.
Furthermore the participants can observe subsidiaries of KPMG and to learn about the business.
Decides who should be in the two rounds of choice in the exit.
Only the crème de la crème of many participants will 394,361
Universities encourage increasingly in choosing and polishing to the high potentials of universities, according to dykta.
"With the race we stress of the estate. "
"The simple distance alone remained us short. "
For the headhunters dykta the notes yield results.
"Until today, we have a similar action in the past year, with all the participants."
" Some are close to an end, and they want to apply for work with us, "says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, are also in the hunt, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises, with its classical jobs fairs.
'We are trying to get students in the skilled fairs. "
"Something on Intersolar," says sitha stübe, encargada staff for the manufacturer of solar technology. SolarWorld
The company Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the website of the company appear 35 vacant posts.
" is still very difficult to fill the vacancies. "
"It costs a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter way is the contact with teachers from the university.
SolarWorld collaborates with several upper schools, for example, the University of. Freiberg
"Teachers advising that there may be with us practices or conduct their thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns to the solar specialists.
Why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A big consortium will not normally can offer it," declares stübe, the attendant staff.
In search of a job, because the money is not the most important.
The decisive factors are flexible work, assistance to children or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study of the great place to work, SolarWorld instituts have the Plaza 55 between the 100 Best Employers of Germany.
The Institute produces an annual list of the best suppliers of German employment.
Which asked the employee the satisfied that it is working with and the environment in the same notes and the preconditions of the employees.
Stübe, responsible for staff also hoped extra points in their classification by his applicants to work.
"I believe that the applicant is fixed especially in the external classifications of a potential employer," says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of deutschen employer branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to win a good reputation as an employer.
Advises its clients more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employer through the own employees," ensures.
In the jargon of the industry calls internal employer branding, also promoting corporate identity within the own staff.
"Some satisfied employees are the best ambassadors. "
When it comes either to the people and identify it with the company, then achieves promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's a game with a gang," said Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the US state of Florida, the Gulf of Mexico has not appeared in these years no new oil drilling.
The government of Washington issued a conclusive prohibition and thereby annulled his previous plans of unappealable way.
Also before the Atlantic coast remain new boreholes off-limits for the time being.
This announced the minister of the interior, Ken Salazar, the Wednesday.
What provoked this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, it is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform '"in April.
Before the misfortune which killed 11 workers and caused the largest environmental catastrophe of the US, President Barack Obama had admitted new boreholes in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico, under pressure from the opposition and the industry.
Supporters wanted well reduce dependency. New supplies of oil from abroad.
Until today has not been entirely clear on who is the responsibility of the irreparable oil slick in the Gulf.
At the centre of criticism is the consortium British Energy BP, which is faced with million demandas.
An investigative commission by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, he lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various consórcio peteroleros filed applications for new attempts of drilling.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe using some controls tougher and stricter safety regulations.
Currently the supervisory authority responsible, that having been accused of charges of corruption has become discredited, root-and-branch reform.
Obama announced parallel that will close gaps prosecutors yielding for the consortia of oil and gas.
The industry announced publicly that the total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest obstacle to the growth of the oil and gas industries," said the outcome of the current poll by the company advises BDO - before the prohibition of extraction on Wednesday.
American Energey alliance complains insecurity in the sector: " No one knows what change exactly with the regulation. '
Investment in new mining projects is prolonged by one, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
Water from rivers is márrón oil, smells like a gas station: millions of litres of crude oil have poured shattered nature in the Ogoniland nigérienne.
People live of theft, corruption and the illegal trade of oil.
To Celestine akpobari seems him well.
"No tire you," reassured by the environmental activist journalists: "Today will happen enough oil to your eyes."
The Nigerian 37 years has achieved to photograph to boys by wading across in the water until the chest with the shine of lights reflected in turbulence in the area: with the colourful shine of water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
Is not on the surface float brown stains of oil.
Before here took prawns to bunches, explains Esther badom in the bank of the river. Bodo-jetty
While, waters flowed are totally dead.
Five years ago poured in the formidable wetland an impressive quantity of oil by a pipe broken.
Fish from the outskirts of the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach full waters of fish: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, was regarded as one of the regions most stunk worldwide.18
In the Way of the route of the river that passes by mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the engine of the boat dismisses a brown broth, who submerge his hand in the water, draw some full of oil.
Raices the trees mangroves rise from the soil as dark licorice sticks, sadly aislan Palmiers that bump and hang his palms.
In vain were looking for flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetland as always: as is entirely the barrier outside, expands in it a kind of ghost calm of a previous paradise with a smell of petrol station.
"What happens here is a struggle," says Green, huraño, Celestine akpobari. "we are living in constant danger to health. "
Appropriate comparison chemists.
The area of the settlement of the Ogoni is a argued battlefield for years: burst here more than 60 years ago the first European navigators, here organised the first resistance in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to put its first factory paris21 Shell in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for the employees of oil.
Still it is nowadays forbidden the return of companies in Ogoniland: while pumped daily more than two million barrels of the black gold to the whole of the Delta region, a size three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipes, the oil fields in Ogoniland were comfortable, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Each 200 metres projected steel platforms as bizarre sculptures of water: "arbolitos of Christmas" affectionately called to the heads of the punches.
Have up to 50 years, most presented a corrosion total.655.
To each moment fails a cabezal, believes akpobari, then Mana a steady stream of oil in the water.
According to the assessments by experts, have poured more than two billion litres in 50 years in the ecosystem of the Delta: year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as averia the ship 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years ago in the Sea of Alaska, one of the biggest catastrophes ecólogicas of the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for the enduring environmental region, lidiará.
While the consortium of Shell and the organized theft of oil are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, the environmentalists see cabezales to the point of breaking up and the leaking pipes as the main cause.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mainly low safety standards normally in the world the conventional, reproached the scientist Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: only defects of the pipes are "on a multiple higher than elsewhere."
In one place, since far seems forgotten, appears a workshop full of oil under the free Sky figures, arise from mangroves are: naked and covered with oil.
Between one of many barrels, which are sometimes linked to the drilling, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, flamea a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Firstly, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the receptacle, later the pipe of oil beads and finalemente sale diesel.
This way, Michael and four employees produce daily until four barrels of diesel 300 litres: "It brings us 34,000 naira ," around 22 million.
The inhabitants of the Delta advantage fuel shortages in one of the greatest oil states of black Africa.
Nigeria had only a single Refineria.
With the absurd and cheap price of coconut-diesel barely 40 euros-céntimo by litre the illegal heaters can offer even less: this reduce the value of their feedstock.
Comes from "The bunkers " trucaron the network of pipes that crosses Ogoniland: according to experts, this step lose at least 16 million litres of oil a day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the material premium tent.ative stored is refined clearly illegally: organised criminal networks, which are also politicians and senior military officers, are the best party in tanks cheap and sell it on the global market.
The activist akpobari considers purely academic the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is rather the management of the population or the toneless way of production.
"If the oil is not behaving as invasive and had totally destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage or theft, or illegal refinerias."
While the conditions of the Ogoni are shattered especially by Shell until the point that only appears a deduction winhec: " Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China. "
Michael is getting nervous.
"It is high time to disappear," said the muscular ölmann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute. "
If the special unit of the Army takes on the illegal refiners, they threaten to arrest, if not with a painful bribery.
The soldiers from the North also want, like all Nigerians, take advantage of the feedstock.
Condemned " this invention has made pieces completely to our country, "says akpobari.
Researchers detected defects of dangerous factory in the engines of the A380
Apparently, the A380 is a big security problem.

Thousands of mourning for the dead miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought in the miners entombed, given by dead after many explosions in a mine.
Todavia have been unable to find the bodies, because of the security measures remain precarious in the place of the catastrophe.
Almost two weeks ago was an intense explosion in the mine Pike River near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 and 62 years, were buried in the mine.
Introduced a probe in the place of the misfortune, but did not find any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue team was able to come down for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts deduced that there was no chance that the miners had survived.
Have not been able to retrieve the bodies to date.
Currently, family members and friends to remember those who have died with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the resplendent shine the sun in Greymouth in New Zealand's South Island.
Remain silent for two minutes.
In tribute of miners entombed, placed 29 officers with helmets, lamps and names of miners.
Had also photographs and personal objects, beneath clothing and surf tables.
The flags flew at half mast at the government buildings in the country.
New Zealand waited that the miners back to the surface " of the depths of the Earth, "said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, participants of the commemoration.

The Gore fits the artistic cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn again explore the boundaries of the genre with his "epic of battles Walhalla Rising."
In what public will have thought the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn when filming " Walhalla rising "?
A Viking warrior prisoner with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees their torturers and assassinates its enemies with fights almost an entirely superhuman one, sounds ideal for young viewers seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and uproot their enemies the bite of their bodies alive when is bad humour.
Moreover, unojo, as it is called in reality, it said almost any word throughout the film, the other characters leave carry by as much one or two sentences, or a couple of painful mortal cries.
Otherwise remained silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying montuosos landscapes of Scotland, that the frames offer the Viking world of approximately thousand years.
Rather ideal for film-makers grown and stakeholders in Existentialism and movements of house very calmed.
When a film has several target groups is a pity that it could not be ruled out. Reinforcing
The director Winding Refn considers his wild and trilogy on hairdressing drug dealer "Pusher" as a sort of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but refuses to do stoically that their works are for all audiences with slightly more humour in the mainstream or somewhat less brutality of the artistic house.
A cerebral mass and bite some sprouting cannot deter most followers of artistic cinema.
Most of the fans of the action are dying of boredom, if unojo takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of missionaries cristioneros violent interpretable reasons and is stuck an eternity in a calm and fog before his team reached and return America to keep quiet there.
It is a pity that " Walhalla rising "has not found cinematographic distributor in Germany and only publish in DVDs.
Is a calamity against the glorious images, but also because, after the presumptuous and bloody façade lies a piece of cinema, sometimes exciting that deserves some attention.
This movie is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And hence no loophole for spectators.
Refn condede is barely a moment of relaxation and his images glaciers and the grim soundtrack of hardship do him a knot in his throat, especially, the incredible hate that, from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blond youngster, which supports unojo faithfully retains something as innocence, all the others are owned by the IRA.
Especially, the hero of one eye, whose reasons not explained ever, becomes any time in a Warrior out of hell to enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of same devil.
The represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising " is a mysterious film that can hate and admire, for anger, alter and wonder.
Experience.
Mysterious land movements
Organization of nuclear energy IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country rejects comment on this subject until permitan controls.
On midnight of 5 and 6 September 2007, at least four Israel warplanes F-15s I attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
Is at the shores of the Euphrates. The largest city, and closer, 30 kilometres is Dair as-saur.
His name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is on a reactor apparently Syrians built with help from North Korea in the Cube, hidden in a valley that leaves the river.
According to information from the international intelligence service. The CIA the end of April 2008, design a common reactor under the name of the neighborhood of el-kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, which is building nuclear weapons.
Instead, technical hardly serves for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation on video with images of blurred satellite.
Showed with an animation by computer where were the components of the reactor before the destruction, which is a reduced copy the model of the North Korean Yongbyon nuclear facility.
Besides taught photographs showing the building since the vicinity or the heartland.
Recently that the reactor was in operation, he said, but it was still not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years later, of the bombing, is barely more known that by then riddles widened with time.
The previous US president, George W. Bush, recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was totally sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in el-kibar, but that hardly saw signs that, in the country there was " a nuclear weapons programme. "
In Europe, several secret-service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a 'alleged reactor, "though considered " plausible " the filing of the CIA.
Lacked solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When asked how sure he was ahead a reactor, a senior diplomat from the UN responded in summer lapidarian way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to take questions."
Syrians undid very quickly from the rubble of the alleged "military building" crippled and raided the ground thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA under the command of former chief inspector Olli Heinonen encontró rastos of uranium in el-kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
Further the IAEA obtained satellite imagery on a member state, of commercial vendors in the just moments after the attack, which must have a value informativo greatest that presented the CIA.
However, these photographies reached the market because of an unknown client, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA could not verify its authenticity. Independently
Syria always intimated that he never had a secret nuclear programme or built any reactor.
Uranium came from the Israeli weapons, explained damaskus.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after analysis of the particles.
Since then damaskus refuses to discuss the issue, as regards satellite images.
Furthermore, controllers to forbids them a second inspection in el-kibar and the entrance to the ruins of the building bombed.
Israel also save a strict silence.
"Never will comment it, " Ehud Olmert, the prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
So, the investigation has yielded no results since June 2008 and "becomes progressively in a serious credibility problem for the authorities," as one Western diplomat of high office corresponds with a place on the IAEA in Vienna, finally is pending a serious offence against the Treaty on the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, for which ensures the IAEA.
The IAEA believes three teams further as the key to progress in the investigation, which should be "functional connection" to the alleged reactor, and others such as these still exist.
Inspectors have not released publicly until the moment of what teams are treated or what functions are, or if they seem suspects.
According to the newspaper süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated as domestic Marj as-sultan, Masyaf iskandariayah and again, from the vicinity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) in Washington identified these places and located a compound near Masyaf with satellite images, which will most likely be one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly finds in or just next to a military base, Syria prohibits with this reason the entrance to the three places to the IAEA.
In Vienna said that the Syrians fear a register that the US has asked the IAEA to spy the military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alert on the teams thanks to warnings by the US secret service
Through satellite photos, the IAEA has indications that moves material between the three locations and the cube to the shores of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high charge in Vienna claimed that at least one of the teams can be " linked to the production of fuel. "
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities ," nor uranium enrichment or refurbishment; processes that are needed for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor was with that actuated uranium is not enriched.
Where the uranium must come and where should subsequently separated plutonium for bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best cases, valid suppositions.
Nor there are doubts about whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can recover, are found in three places.
As they disappeared the hundreds of cargo trucks soil, no one has information about where remain rubble.
The oiae considers unlikely al-tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from el-kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, which the Syrians acknowledged in 1998 by his aptitude as area to radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous inspector of the IAEA, the linked to the reactor on an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the pictures from orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three alleged suspicious places and eliminated large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
May be coincidence, but hardly contributes to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA had spent a few months to develop a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians allowed, to preserve the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the extent of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, damaskus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago, reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the issue is not much urgency, since a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of US ambassador alleges the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that nuclear authorities vienesas have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, which must propose these inspections, has spoken of " an option that I am open to the future, "but still hesitates.
This way is very risky: this requires the majority of the Council of the interior of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not precisely anxious by an escalation.
Moreover, as reflected a diplomatic: " What happens if, at the end, they do not find anything? "
Love in the times of war
There are problems since Angelina Jolie began in the summer with the management of his debut yet name.
Herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not know much more about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumour is very persistent, women, Muslim, falls in love with his Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Associations of Bosnian women have protested quickly, which at the last moment moved some days of planned filming in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has filmed in Hungary and in the post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of war victims wrote to the High Commissioner of the UN, UNHCR, Jolie and requested a meeting with the comedian, informed a newspaper Bosnian, Jolie is the ambassador for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Is not diplomatic, weeks ago women offered him a meeting in Hungary which rejected.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
Are not stories of love in the fields of violations, and the position of Jolie thereon betrays victims enough about the script.
His organization agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended to dismiss Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what has written exactly Jolie for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture to read the script, awarded after a tug-of-war a permit of recording in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie was not despite everything.
The young author reiterates that it pursues political purposes with his film introduces with a lot of effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrific consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains vague.
In the network circulates a second synopsis of the film, which sounds quite different: the lovers were together before the start of the war and returned to be found when she, a Bosnian Muslim, she was deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is variant " rape victim falls in love with. "torturer
Is sure that the film really begins, Jolie before the war.
Pressure on it, "says Jolie, is unfair and is based on erroneous information."
Presently can make peace with the Hollywood hacker: while the script is in the network illegally, as many others before.

Forecasts confirm, a migratory wave comparable to that which hit the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progression that trajó a big welfare to the Irish, currently extends melancholy.
The economic crisis confuses especially youngsters, well-trained Irish, for that so far, everything is uphill.

The Democratic routine
Keeps increasing support for democracy in Latin America, as well as the support to private companies.
Crime generates more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in a large part of the region, is to Brazil as a more influential country that the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro cesnur conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Given that the survey has been held regularly since 1995, allows monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
In the results of the survey this year, in September and early October, are two issues involved.
The first is the relatively encouraged humour of the situation in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has risen considerably in the various countries of the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, support for democracy has risen since a fallen 40 per cent in 2005 to 61% this year.
Also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries of the zone, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44 per cent of those surveyed in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in their country, the same figure last year, but significantly higher than the 25 percent in 2001 (Figure 3).
Roughly 34 per cent said that they hoped the Congress of his country and the 45 per cent in government, the same amount that the past year in both cases, but considerably higher in relation to 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turmoil in Latin America have seriously affected the support democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained over the global financial crisis is likely to be due to many Latin American countries, just were affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Furthermore, the existence of a social safety net stronger has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increase marginally in 2009 and that it has declined again this year, up 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of achievement.
That sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious, and have increased violent crimes.
For the second time since it began the survey in Latin America, more respondents mentioned crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing the country (see chart 5).
Some 31 per cent said that either themselves or a close relative, has been a victim of crime in the past year, a figure that has declined from 38 per cent last year and is the lowest figure since 1995.
More positive economic returns reflected in greater support to private companies and the market economy: Some 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private firms are essential for development, while in 2007 was only 56% (see Figure 6).
Some 58% agreed that the market economy is the only system that will enable his country develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
Is interesting that 62 per cent of those surveyed in Venezuela opinan likewise (and 80% supports private companies), while his left-handed president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country that has more leadership in the region, such as the 19 percent of respondents, compared to 18 per cent last year), followed by the United States (the 9%, same as in the past year) and Venezuela (9 per cent compared to 11 per cent a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered more influential by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela have such title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the rubbish
Nobody expected that the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, it took much less than feared foreigners who try to help the country to pick up after their problems.
Introduced votes in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots thrown in sewers, polling destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late. With
Groups, including many Haitians displaced by the earthquake in January, wandered over the area trying to discover where they needed to vote.
Some of them, in the end, they gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the annulment of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, were spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations official highest in Haiti, said that the elections were "relatively good in many respects. "
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean community said, cautiously, that " we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious they are, necessarily invalidate the process. "
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents is committed with René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and their candidate, Jude Célestin should announce preliminary results on 7 December.
It is expected that the run-off will be held in January.
Have not yet lost all hopes in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapero, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request requesting the cancellation of the vote.
But still problems could arise if the electoral authority announced that Mr Célestin support that has little, if any, has been moved to the second round.
Taking into account that the cholera epidemic is ravaging the country, and more than a million quake survivors are still living in tents, was expected a large abstention.
Is time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
Around 250,000 identity documents needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There is much at stake.
Aid donors believe that the election of a popular and legitimate government is a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as has become apparent, we also think the Haitians themselves.
Moving on tiptoe towards the centre
In the weeks that have passed since lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great deal of sympathy from the public that it has increased its contents popularity in 20 points, to more than 50 per cent, the highest level recorded since his election in 2007.
Despite everything, that might make it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Madam fernándezs neglects the intransigence of her late husband, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, on this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was taking charge of economic policy even after his wife happen as president, was in the habit of preparing budgets that infravaloraban fiscal income, economic growth and inflation.
This enabled the presidential marriage spend additional income to their discretion.
In theory, the government of Mrs fernándezs lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation which has worsened following the death of Kirchner because of a heart attack on the 27 October.
Some dissenting members of the Peronista movement in power have faced Mrs Fernández.
However, after some chaotic sessions in which a member punched him in the face and others accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I am not going to discuss," said the president.
The 2010 budget, in consequence, will be implemented in the next year, which would give the president a margin for action even greater when to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: probably grow up to 9 per cent this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, besides the wage demands of the unions, the lumps around 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made that growth and poverty reduction were priorities, instead of inflation control.
Refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and the INDEC, the statistical institute mass-produced, official inflation statistics.
May will moderate now President fernándezs these policies?
Has convened meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the unions.
Moreover, its officials say that they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been driven by high prices for agricultural exports in the world. Argentine
However, inflation has limited kickstart growth achieved with a big devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason, Mrs fernándezs is showing signs of wanting to restore financial ties of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government came to an agreement with bond holders that had been denied to a forced restructuring of the debt Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs fernándezs is about to conclude an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the club of Paris, to be about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchner always insisted that this would not involve IMF surveillance as usual.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to develop a new consumer price index, which seems the Prelude cleaning the INDEC
It was not clear whether the President Fernández wants to continue in politics when it ends its mandate, taking into account that it is no longer with her husband at her side.
If it does, it will need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has tired of Kirchnerismo.
When Argentines return in March from their summer holidays, the wave of sympathy for it will have waned.
If wants to win other elections, will have to decide whether or not, repudiates calmly, many of the policies of her husband.
East hurrrah China
Voters in Taiwan are approaching slowly to a kind of closer union with the continent.
What is Taiwan on his big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a comprehensive assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr Ma has become an advocate of the feelings by the continent, innovative forging business links, including a free-trade pact parcial, the biggest changes in relations with China since 1949.
Mr Ma pass the test, but by little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) winning three of the five elections for mayor, was not able to obtain the majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been tipped for a total independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50 percent of all the votes compared to 45% of the KMT.
If they had been the presidential election, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, ppd empató with the KMT in municipalities.
In elections could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large agglomerations with banderitas and light girls dancing clothing.
Nor lacked mysterious assassination attempt of rigour.
Are lien, the Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the candidates from the KMT the night before the election.
A man in the crowd fired at the young directly to the face, injuring him and killing a passerby.
The strange thing is that it has not been possible to determine if the man meant to hurt lien or revenge of the candidate.
In any case, said Mr. Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, shooting affected elections, sowing suspicion on PPD and causing voters bent by the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
Was surprising that they were not the subject of the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates spoke of plans of public accommodation and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT usually avoid giving publicity to its ties with the government in Beijing.
But this time also PPD avoided to encourage the feeling against China.
Responds to the new awareness that the Chinese trade is vital to the economic survival of Taiwan.
For his part, Mr Ma said that he had confirmed that its policy with regard to China was acceptable to the majority of the Taiwanese.
It is expected that the government in Beijing to bribing them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare for a summit, on the protection of investments and the medical cooperation.
Without doubt, I would like to also ensure the political integration, but first things first.
The best will be expected to become the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago was in a bad situation: their former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on charges of corruption.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly abetted the explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Mr. Tsai, has produced a new generation of moderate and PDP is striving to attract professionals and young.
Mrs Mr. Tsai has been hailed as a welcome PDP candidate for the presidency, like his Tseng-chang, who met mandate under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Mr. Tsai announced plans for the creation of a panel of experts, who act as a point of contact between PPD and China, provided that they can be carried out the negotiations without preconditions.
Mrs Mr. Tsai said the Taiwanese public that his party represents a " credible alternative " to the hasty approach of Mr Ma with regard to China.
Mr Chen seems raging for change.
In a statement issued from his cell, said that candidates of PPD could have been better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
Even ordered Mr its, a pragmatic, not to submit to the presidential.
Even without interceding Mr Chen, PPD will find it difficult to choose between their potential candidates.
The KMT it should do a review of conscience.
Assessments of Mr Ma have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; the KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seem mainly unemployment and the increasing differences between rich and poor.
KMT a spokesman said that will formalize his cabinet, as well as local teams.
The big samples of PPD suggest that the support of Taiwan to a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most of the Taiwanese believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, " already has crossed the point of no return. "
Nominations the Grammy: the jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the election surprise in the category of revelation. Artist
Acts at the request of a chairman and possibly people are defined in it.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz singer and declining 26 years selected personally by the President Obama to act in his ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a nomination in the category of best artist revelation.

"
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society ," without doubt, represented a great step forward, and, in light of its vocal style ptab-2.5 and pleasant, as well as a big skill with influences of pop, funk and Latin rhythms, it can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the road towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent to the voters of the Grammys, who lately have been concentrated in the area of the Jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy made honour with reason to " historicity " Vijay Iyer is a thrilling and magnificent disk that was one of the favorites last year.
Between competitors from Iyer is the veteran saxophonist James Moody with " moody 4B " and the typist John Beasley " positootly. "
Trombone Shorty, a strident favourite in New Orleans and invited usual in "Treme," the HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, which for the rest was leaning considerably towards the merger as in the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The savage punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society obtained a well-deserved recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the big jazz of House of Billy Childs ensemble and always risky Dave Holland, whose album live with his octet, " pathways ," was a great example of the Democratic leadership of the bit in his gang.

The mosque proposal in Temecula obtains the approval of the Commission of ordenamiento
Draft mosque for Temecula has obtained the unanimous support of the committee of local legislation after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project saying it encourages terrorism and congestion.
However, members of the Commission decided on Wednesday evening that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive at the aesthetic.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christian and Jewish or baháí, of all faiths," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am proud of."
Shows that justice prevails. "
"The opposition is really minimum," it adds.
" single which talk very high ."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight; most of the time was devoted to people intercedía in favour or against the centre, about the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's Web site.
"America no longer exists," read in one of the comments.
"It is another planet of the Apes with Mrs dead freedom in the sand ."
"America has fallen ."
Building plans of Islamic centres have caused protests also in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the New York area where there was the attacks of September 11, 2011.
In the Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud harmoush has denounced violence.
His congregation of near 135 families carries years living without problems in the county of Riverside, but wanted more space and a better that the warehouse that leased in a shared property with a manufacturer of filtration systems of water.
The new mosque of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
Would cover an area of 4,32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still resort the project to the City Council.
A resistant microbe to arsenic raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of an odd bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of new ways of life on Earth, and possibly other planets.
Although investigators discovered the curious bacterium here in the land, they say that it demonstrates that it is possible that life forms without the main elements that deemed critical.
"This agency has a double capacity."
"can grow with phosphorus or with arsenic."
'That makes for something very peculiar, although little I needed to be a way of life alien' really ', "commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the publication Thursday of science.
Since some time ago, it is considered that there are six major elements essential for life: the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous and sulphur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after substituting the phosphorus by arsenic.
" Does you pose you what more is possible, "said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
Anbar, as noted, the discovery is important for the search for life on planets of the land, given that researchers need to recognize life, know the aspect that has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, calling a press conference to discuss this issue, which does not disclose details of the discovery, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility of the report indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
Did not.
What the discovery "Yes shows is that in other planetary surroundings, could have agencies that use other elements to boost his biochemistry and that the whole of " standard " elements that we believe are essential for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor of planetary and space sciences research institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it shows the replacement of an element by another in the biochemistry and the basic biochemical structure," added Cockell.
The discovery was not by accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it contains high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar chemically, by what especuló that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one by another.
"arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is similar to the phosphorus."
" Consequently, it can be complicated to the agencies. "differentiating
"However, arsenic is sufficiently different as not to work as well as phosphorus, for what it is and, to put it one way, toughen the biochemical machinery," explains Anbar.
Investigators recovered bacteria known as gfaj-1 and exposed them to increased concentrations of arsenic, which attained to adapt and used to grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but to demonstrate that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may be naturally a way of life that use arsenic, whether in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, noted that the idea that we can replace the arsenic by the phosphorus is not new, but had never been an example to show that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the first era of the Earth, he said, the researchers speculated that the first forms of life may have used.
'Yes that suggests that there might be other means to generate living, not only in the way that life formed in the Earth in the past, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and National Institutes of Health.
Have found the stolen dogs missing in Compton
The two dogs have been found missing the four stolen in front of the motel Bellflower, according to the sheriff's official said of the County of Los Angeles on Thursday.
The four dogs of competition, two akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the van Chevrolet Express 2006 which were happening the night, compared to Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.

"We are following some tracks."
Was not able to find the owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard peek and David, to make a comment on Thursday.
Met with their two akitas at an animal shelter in Downey County on Wednesday afternoon.
Aides of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the akitas (trace, a dog of 3 years, and Didi, a dog 10 months) had not suffered damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and peek pretended to exhibit in competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese owners of the dogs, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and had the intention to exhibit to trace.
The other dogs went them to exhibiting in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the tournament, according to AKC / Eukanuba peek indicated to The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the tour for nearly two months of the couple involved in canine competitions.
On Monday evening, made Peek and Rickard check-in in the motel.
Usually remain in motels and park his truck in front of the window of his room.
Wore other three dogs (a child of Boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the room. Motel
But left the akitas and corgis in the van because they have a very thick fur and would be cooler.
Windows left slightly open, so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek Rickard and reported the theft of the van on Tuesday, at six in the morning.
Peek had said that offer a reward to anyone who could drive them until the corgis, with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday it was not clear whether it would be a reward or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of GMMs achieves the final adoption of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, GMMs has finally achieved the green light to start again.
On Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge in New York formally adopted the plan " prearming "by creditors to delete approximately $5 billion of debt, paving the way for the company of Entertainment 86 years approach their efforts in the production and release of films and television programmes.
Soolefai Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so that there is no other legal obstacles to GMMs be relaunched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, that will become the main executives of what will be a study reduced.
The personnel will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, GMMs will not chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closing a credit instrument planned $500 million, to fund operations and new productions of the GMMs.
The investment bank is currently sindicando the credit, which by his account was contributing $75 million, and it is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The process of restructuring the study began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to give advice on the necessary management to manage their finances, while it struggled to interest payments by $300 million a year.
In August, the director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former president of Enron and expert in recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work in Krispy Kreme doughnuts.
Attempts of Moelis and Cooper to resolve the financial tribulations of GMMs and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study, which required a lot more time than expected.
After several months of discussions, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none is ready to pay more than 2 billion seeking creditors.
Before the spring of this year, returned to the drawing board, while the team of GMMs began work on a plan of restructuring that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors at the end of October.
When officially GMMs emerge from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive bonuses for their work. Multibillion
Moelis & Co., which already has received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper Companies, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their services to the administration of the company, will receive a " success " fee of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart production in GMMs, that premiered only one movie this year, and met an annual Blackboard of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
Also plan co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The study needs conclude a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million to fund its part of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18 per cent of the debt of GMMs, had been trying to settle a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the biggest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies were not in agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
Whereas iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy of this year, followed by, perhaps, the system of games Microsoft Kinect, both can mean a significant dent in its budget for gifts.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad can buy five bicycles BMX 99 dollars each, and a game Kinect costs the same as 10 ropes of classical jump adorned with accounts, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping its budget for gifts in balance.
Recently visited to three vendors of national toys, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy for less than $80.
Was immediately clear that Moore's law has been working; the technological toy of this year is likely to have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared with the last year.
Also, while there is usually less new toys with websites Partners, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, they have more offers.
And toys driven by Button batteries are increasing, as well as the toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are of Toys " R " Us, unless it is indicated otherwise).
The sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) toys are soft toys the size of a cobayo that sing a note when tighten their Barrigas.
A squeeze equals a note, and a second squeeze begins to arming a song.
If you buy one or more, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: once it begins to tighten, cannot stop.
For vocals combined with dance track star, Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and above), is the better option.
Borrow technology of Elmo Live last year, the doll animatrónico 14 inches plays games of shift as simóm said, and may make the lunar step, thanks to his innovative feet articulated with wheels with productivity-knowledge blockade.
Children testing the toy used to Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of a control volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, can remind Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He returned (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for 3 years, and more), with a full rucksack letters of questions designed to convert a walk in a car in a meeting with a fascicle proesa ocurrente self-correcting.
If you are unfriendly to give your child his intelligent telephone, here econtrará three independent alternatives.
Mobigo of VTech ($60, of 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and the easiest to use, presenting a Qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, from 3 to 12 years), is the first major overhaul of the line, a screen Leapster with more new and brilliant.
Any version is compatible with the old cartridges.
IXL from Fisher-Price (90 dollars, from 3 to 7 years) uses a system of the type iTunes to submit games and e-books, and has a slot for SD cards that allows to visualise family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and above), it is a game of five blocks barely bigger than a box of matches, each with his own screen LEDs.
The aim is to arm words placing blocks in row before the end time, is formidable for a competition improvised armed words.
Are increasingly toys that have some sort of connection online.
Based only in its presence in jugueterías, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy from his son a pet online in the Club Penguin, for example, can achieve a Disney Club Penguin 2 'mix' n match appears pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years) that includes a currency with a code hidden.
When you change the code online, his son gets enough funds in the shop of the Penguin Club for two articles.
These could include skate on wheels or a toy pet puffle.
Slightly larger than the sow their toothbrush, hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and above), is the last in a line of microrobots driven by batteries of Button.
The false insect moves quickly on 12 legs of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
Is fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if it can find the exit.
Is also lasting.
Ours were able to leave the kitchen table and even spend a while inside the mouth of our dog.
Promotes a more moderate side of the maintenance of order in China
As a sergeant urban instructor, Tang shenbin marked the passage in a square of the city, inspecting harshly with the nervous dependants, issuing orders in low voice with military authority.
He wanted female members of police, the chengguan corpulentos of urban order China, feared and despised by their wayward forceful measures and his inclination to violence, communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
'firm! "
"Attention!"
You show them, whispered, " How are the beautiful girls! "
Four girls that hardly happened adolescence with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tailored trousers to draw attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly ranged.
Four elegant hats placed perfectly above the hair tied with moños to blue and white lines.
"Personally, I think they are a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, contemptuously.
"The models are beautiful."
Over a government has tried to clean up the image of the urban inspectors China.
A city ordered that all new recruits have a bachelor's degree.
Guangdong province changed the green colour of the uniforms appalling to a blue supposedly more attractive.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force by intimidating gaze: in 2009, according to one report, 50 officers surrounded a wayward cart of snacks, and observed it with frowns fruncido continuously for half an hour, until the seller fhfcs peddling their things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to his urban police 13 women expressly elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the coarse police a softer side, female.
Regrettably, to Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to raise small respect of China to these squadrons of the city.
And for a good reason, would argue the critics.
Unlike police, these officers are authorised only in enforcing city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media portray a different reality. Routinely
In January 2008, the inspectors of the Hubei province killed a bystander after having used his mobile phone to film them while they dissolved a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for inspectors of Beijing was Hurtado and published on the Internet, which was described as a scourge effectively to criminals without letting them bleed.
This year, a Hawker of watermelons of Shanghai suffered brain damage after a brawl with five officers.
A game of full video of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese attacking street vendors.
"chengguan has left a scar on the government," regretted China Daily, a national publication, last year after a dispute over tactics.
The journal demanded " a really punctilious cleaning. "
Skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News wondered if women were real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The notice of district called feminine candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure " and five harmonious facial shots. "
Must have a height above average, higher to 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 1 ½ inches.
The withdrawal to the age of 26 is compulsory.
The officials said that the work was physically too arduous for women with more than 25 years.
"Their image is the important thing," he said an anonymous district official to rednet.com, a website. Quasi-governmental
"First, the external qualities of candidates determine if they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial shots, etc."
Afterwards comes the temperament "and the inner qualities ."
The Chengguan are female as vases, he said, and added, "in addition to being vases, will have other responsibilities. "
Zheng Lihua, director of the Office of Management of the city in the District, is not eager to back that description.
But noted that the demands were height-for-age standards in many warnings of Chinese work for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement for harmonious facial shots.
If this means to be bet, it is a matter of debate between the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be reported.
" We cannot allow a lame person or a jorobado come to work here, "said Mr Zheng.
" their image would not be right. "
Liu Yi, who patrol the square baoguang near a monastery, has 22 years, with their dyed cheeks and a mouth curve. Subtly
She not think that the emphasis in his appearance, he said. It is sexist
"Do you think that with this seem sexy uniform? " asked with a look sardónica.
His workmate with hoyuelos, Xu Yang, 21, said: "Our work has to present the image of the city."
Nor oppose their work on time, they said, because they have ambitions of main career that simply flush out sellers in the alleys where they are supposed to be confined its business.
Each morning, the squadron faced more or less to a dozen vendors which are made on foot or bicycle, attempting to sell tantos buns or tazones of tofú as possible before being thrown.
"Mr Wang has to leave."
"I have said many times!" said Miss Xu while a seller escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his car Tirado by bicycle with garrisons noodles.
The officials described his duties as more monotone that exhausting.
"This is more or less the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying marketing in their free time.
" very routine ."
One reason is that the feminine officials lack the power of their male counterparts of confiscating the goods of sellers.
Only can threaten to denounce the infractores their supervisors men.25
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of people in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after scattered the false rumour that Chengguan officers had killed a seller.
More than a dozen police officers or officers chengguan injured in the nocturnal episode; 14 government vehicles were dumped or set fire.
By the time Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Only two streets of the genial Plaza baoguang, where the feminine officials patrolled this morning, more than 50 people had gathered in a corner.
The officers had confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired in the sidewalk instead of in a workshop, as required under the rules.

Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Lawyers of senator announced Wednesday that prosecutors from the Department of Justice have exculpated Senator John Ensign criminal allegations that emerged from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to ensure workplace through lobby for the husband of the woman.
The decision ends the legal threat more serious facing Ensign, Republican of Nevada, who was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal about his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said that he was "certainly satisfied" by the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
Senator still could face a disciplinary measure of the ethics committee of the Senate.
Lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice we had "reported that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of its research and that it has no plan to lift charges against him because of this issue ."
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said they seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobby.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents to be made public in the first place in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain yielding work through lobby, to ensure the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, to the affair of the senator with her.
Mrs Hampton once worked as treasurer of a campaign of Ensign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work to Mr Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant of Ensign, was excluded according to the law to lobby their former employer or the Senate for a year.
The ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "lobbying 9241546158 _ chap6.pdf revolving door" ban, which aims to restrict that former state employees used their connections to make personal businesses.
Of the evidence that has been made public, " seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate the statute substantially 9241546158 _ chap6.pdf revolving door, "said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the case of Ensign, Mr brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department felt cautious in accepting political processings after several significant setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to abandon the prosecution against former senator Ted Stevens amid charges of misconduct proceedings.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly some cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defense that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that government officials of high rank, can now assume that laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that he received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday, and another call more the following day, saying that the department did not want to lift charges against his client.
The defence team of Ensign had been cooperating with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, " acted in accordance with the law. "
Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments that gave prosecutors.
"I do not feel comfortable entering details on my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think that they took the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation in a separate complaint by the Group of ethics, which alleges that a payment of $96,000 Ensign's parents to the Hampton violated electoral federal law.
The Electoral Commission said he did not have sufficient evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important Company of Nevada that had long supported Senator, which got Labour through lobby thanks to aid that Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company agreed to Hampton as lobbista, the chief of staff, John Lopez, Ensign contacted Hampton and told him that he was " hammering " the Ministry of the interior on a matter in dispute.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another client of Nevada, and Allegiant Air, called the Secretary of Transportation to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after Hampton had hired to lobby.
When news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign asked forgiveness to their constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters that planned to posit to a third term in the Senate.
When the spokesman of Ensign, Jennifer Cooper, Ensign announced that it was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, said that the senator had hoped that the ethics committee quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice, and to complete its investigation.
"Senator Ensign has wishes to continue with his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
The appeal of Cheshire will aim to Twitter
Had half-a-dozen them "chateando" in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute to minute, sent reports of the frightful testimony via Twitter.
At the end, said the defence had more than 140,000 Twitter messages on the process that addressed rape and children tied to their beds in a house fire was burning.
On Thursday, the widely followed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official end with the imposition of the judge of the death sentence passed by the jury.
But lawyers of Mr hayess have submitted written in the court which outlined the arguments of appeals that probably will occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the extensive use of Twitter by journalists of mass media, created "an atmosphere of circus', and such saturation widespread and immediate with details exaltadores made the public passions exerted an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The catchword could force the appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
" according to what I experienced during this process, I think that there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom are affecting the rights of individuals to a fair trial, "said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for the defence of Mr hayess.
The trial Judge Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, rejected lacónicamente the demands in a ruling last week, saying that media reports were " carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence that the jury had been carried by the passion.
But probably will not be the last word on the subject.
For decades, courts of appeals have acknowledged that the coverage of cases celebrate can generate questions about the impartiality of a process.
In a landmark judgement, the 1966 United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a osteópata of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying their decision in the case, Sheppard vs. Maxwell had " a carnival atmosphere in the process "because of the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the TV programme and the film "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers said that the Court of Appeals, which reviewed the conviction of Mr hayess half a century later, might be puzzled by the argument that they could be necessary new rules to control the form of a communication from the courtrooms, something inimaginadable at the time of the case. Dr Sheppard
" There is a general reason for concern on the impact of the new media "in processes of high profile, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of the School of Law of Stanford, that studied the death penalty in Connecticut, and wrote a report in which it was said that this was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigued by the idea that limit the immediate communication from the courtrooms could make trials more fair.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the issues outlined by many lawyers of hayess, that will probably be debated for years, delaying an execution.
Defence lawyers also contend, for example, that hayess could have been injured when the judge refused to allow them to blue testearan reactions of potential jurors, showing them horrifying pictures of the scene of the crime during the selection of the jury.
Some jurors have said that they were horrified by the pictures of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge wrongly stirred up to a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and incorrectly that had pressed for a verdict by his odd decision to order him to the jury deliberating over a weekend.
Jurors were not abducted.
But their arguments about the impact of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the attention.
Them observed in a challenge to the ruling filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
Them argued that media continuously threw fuel to the fire of the emotion of the case.
" agglomeration tweets daily media, cameras and reporters outside of the court, "wrote the attorneys," was something never seen here in New Haven, and perhaps in the entire state. "
Its attention to the coverage of tweeter is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news were more important than the reports delivered more slowly, were ludita a vision that would make the policy of the tribunal on the control of the coverage was weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that appeals courts often felt attracted by arguments about the adjustment required in the courts because of the social and technological changes.
Hayess lawyers are lobbying by this catchword.
In his writing, referred to the 1966 decision of the Supreme Court, which overturned the conviction of Dr Sheppard due to coverage of the process, and made it clear that would require that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for the invective and negativity, this week has unchained a little civility in Washington.
Is a harbinger of a genuine bipartisan cooperation future or a moment illusory before a speedy return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress produced no breakthrough on the biggest issues that must be discussed during the meeting. Outgoing
But by all accounts, he was at least a polite discussion of the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, in time, be another empty episode to win points partisan.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit commission was equally civilised, despite political differences that exist between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction during a period of months resulted in a mutual respect that goes beyond the ideological divide that still separates members.
That is barely enough to declare that it has reached a new era of cooperation.
Now both sides are in a trial period, sondeándose reinforcing to identify signs of cooperativism and commitment, as they evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters in a renewed war partisan.
Reason why the meeting on Tuesday and the subsequent evaluation of the same on the part of the participants were with minimal demands or indictments.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and they are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change of climate that existed during the past two years.
Whether taxes, spending, healthcare and social assistance, the two sides are poles apart.
Anyway, the election November has softened the humour in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed about the way to see things," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the center of ethics and public policy.
"are inevitable after the election.
Elections sportex passions adherents, then extinguish.
That is good. "
In some issues, in particular those that are on the agenda of the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
The tax cuts Bush win at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, it is likely that there is a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because the Republicans can't make people believe that they are in favour of the tax cuts for the rich, denied unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday at the White House, there is growing optimism about a possible deal on these topics over the outgoing meeting, together with the ratification of a new nuclear disarmament pact Start (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution, notes that the successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the meeting no outgoing will necessarily lead to a continuous bipartisanship 112do. When the new Congress convenes in January.
Stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely, and so inevitable, to begin a period of disagreement.
"After that, the things that must be done to be carried out, in the short term the psychology reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) on the fact that civility can lead to real cooperation.
"see the bulk of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012 ," he said.
The reasons have a great deal to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea party voters, who were instrumental in its creation.
By more awareness the Republican leaders about the dangers of exaggerating its position, know that they have to try to meet their promises to cut government spending and repeal the new health law.
These lines already adherents be clearly observed in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Commission for the deficit, which include reform of the tax code and the increasing some taxes and retirement age, and the cost cutting.
The co-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have introduced to force the question of the deficit in the order of the day in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the Commission's 18 members to publish its plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
Greatest resistance is between elected officials in the signpost in tax matters, suggesting that there is, at least currently, few bases or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in battles between the Republicans from the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of bump supporters, when the Republicans challenge to Obama on the budget, tax and medical assistance, followed then by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties will be watching carefully the reaction of the people.
Whoever consider losing it is likely to change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic vision.
Partisanship and polarization are now greater than they were in the middle of the 1990s, and seems to have a bigger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans in their time.
At the same time, activists of both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilismo that shows this week can be welcome by many Americans.
But this will require a lot more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
An American document leaked portrays to Moscow as a paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a "tailored," and makes it a part of the bribes and money of protection that collects directly to the Kremlin, reported in February, the U.S. Embassy in Russia.
Reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service handle huge systems of blackmail, which help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
Them collect money not only legitimate businesses, but also of organised criminal groups.
Every stratum of bureaucracy, which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called " vertical authority ," takes its part as the money rises in the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note was based on sources whose names have been censored.
Was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and the blame for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev sacked it in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleaning since.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a major construction company, have consistently denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several demands for libel on such accusations.
In September, where a television channel Russian asked him on a documentary that suggested that he was corrupt, said: "It's madness, a canard, a nuisance."
According to surveys, the Russians believe overwhelmingly that its society is corrupt.
But is unusual to find the details explained in detail, because they were in the report of the embassy, and it is unheard of that the diplomats from a foreign country who do that.
"The direct links of the government of the city of Moscow with criminality have led some to call it 'dysfunctional', and stating that the government operates as a more tailored that as a government, " says the note.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'Krysha' (a term of the criminal world and mafia that literally means" roof "or protection) that crosses the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all levels of the bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world. " Moscow
"Luzhkov is more."
"The SFS, MVD and militia are in the second tier."
"Finally, common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
" This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services. "
The report asserts that the SFS collects the money from the larger companies, and that the police points to small shops.
A source, said the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understood that the best is to ensure the protection of the MVD and SFS (instead of the organized crime groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and power that criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law. "
"For this reason, protecting against the criminal gangs it is no longer a priority."
Note notes that, while the collection of money is complete, protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those not paid quickly find their businesses closed for a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times on the fight against corruption, but has admitted that it has made little progress.
Note of the embassy reports on men taking cases, probably full of cash, inside the same Kremlin.
"in its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, head of the group of experts of INDEM in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But it is a part of that bureaucracy."
" he does not belong to a political class, because there is a political class in Russia. "
Without politics, without opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, INDEM estimates that corruption costs him to Russia more than $300 billion per year.
A recent survey on global perceptions of corruption carried out by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154 (countries are classified from the least to most corrupt).
Disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which did not occur until the evening Moscow time, surely will cause discontent within the Russian government, and despite Luzhkov can be faulted for the weaknesses of Moscow, could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that documents WikiLeaks could be lies and reacted furiously by a disclosure stating that American diplomats called it Batman and Robin. Medvedev
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of the domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, not we suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, that would be done in a manner so immoral."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past
In a concrete classroom weakly lit, with stained walls and descascaradas, the director of the secondary school Anlong Veng recalled the man who had constructed, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge. Ta Mok
'here all love Ta Mok. "
"He was a good leader and cared for his people," said sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Known as "The Butcher" by its brutality during the Khmer Rouge, the commander, remains popular in this remote former strength of the Khmer Rouge, in north-western Cambodia, where built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and which still live thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge were surrendered to the government, the loyalty sustained for long is being finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation, enabled victims who publicly deal to the people who were involved in the scheme.
In June, the government distributed here a textbook of secondary school for the first time she taught the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a mixed tribunal of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years' imprisonment.
With each of these events, the anxiety has grown among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and his attempts to return to the Cambodian society.
" There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but could not do anything, "said Youk Chhnang, director of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an independent organisation that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil ."
"This is creating divisions within the family ."
During the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, were executed or died of starvation, disease and overwork, about 1.7 million people.
When, in 1979, the Vietnamese invaded and toppled the government, led by Pol Pot, the remnants of the regime and its military have fled to the border with Thailand. Cambodia
There launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN, would lead to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to deserting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of in 1996, Ieng Sary and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek mountains.
Died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the most former fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell in absolute poverty which is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite officials Khmer Rouge conserved their local administrative posts to lay down their arms, the foot soldiers remain poor farmers and not qualified.
"This people has obtained few profits after the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Centre for justice and reconciliation, offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"them have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime '.
"them were upbrought without any concept to do business ."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge when I was a teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before engaging to life as a farmer of poor rice in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was well," he said.
" Ta Mok gave him to eat at all. "
"But now, the life is difficult, because we have to. " autoabastecernos
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, it is expected that the court will start to prosecute Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The mandate for the tribunal is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but has not said if it will pursue cases in addition to those four.
This not done much to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent media speculation has focused on IM chaem, 64, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told investigators of the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, which had overseen the building of the dam of trapeang thma, a project in which they are thought to have died as thousands of workers forced.
During an afternoon shameful recent, im chaem returned to work in the fields of his home on piles of wood in a path of land on the outskirts of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the grass reseco, im chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She argued that if the court summoned it would not be presented.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable," he said.
"If there are more processings, there will be war ."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge, in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that if the court will be instability persecutes more suspects, while the experts and historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past." claimed
But confront the past is precisely what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhnang, the documentation centre.
"reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to relink the pieces," he said.
"It is our obligation to collect these pieces so that we can understand."
The centre was the first book of the text adopted by the government on the Khmer Rouge, "a history of Democratic Kampuchea," 75 pages.
Was distributed in Anlong Veng in June, as a supplement to the textbook history of secondary school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know few details of the Khmer Rouge, despite the link to the city with the regime.
Valeak curfew, 19, a student at the high school of Anlong Veng, said that the new textbook helps students to understand a significant part of its history.
But their parents reacted with scepticism when it carried the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the book, and the court," he said.
"them have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of people prosecuted the court ."
Such resistance has made that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But public forums, the textbook and the tribunal are beginning to have an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek mountains, a path with too many weeds and filled plastic bags refused leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a roof. Tin oxidised
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom sothea of 31 years, a seller of mobile phones, at the edge of the road, said he did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit of the place, and many people go there to pray him," said.
Was the birthday of Nuom sothea, and later that day decided to walk to the site of the last rest of Pol Pot, which would leave a whole bunch of mature bananas hoping for good luck.
Belarus accepts renounce its pool of qualified uranium for weapons
In a surprising victory for the campaign of President Obama to protect nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that will relinquish its reserve of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of the nuclear weapons.
The treatment was revealed in a joint statement issued after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a summit of security.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus that abandons its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return in the spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that took place a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84,82 kg of uranium qualified for armament of an installation of Byelorussian investigations.
This prepared the ground for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke anonymously because of the confidentiality of the item.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the nuclear security summit of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently he was a very good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
" Really I was fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the nuclear security summit in 2012. "
"This demonstrates that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for global security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said that the agreement is "a very significant step and important" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague secure all vulnerable nuclear material around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries it did under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had declared that the nation would never relinquish its uranium.
"have conserved the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and the low-enriched uranium," said Lukashenko in that time.
"This is our prime matter... we are not going to manufacture dirty bombs, and we are not going to sell them to anyone else."
" use it for research purposes, is everything. "
However, Belarus was close to the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials said that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus, in October, it was a particularly complicated, because the material had been slightly irradiated elements.
Officials said that he was loaded onto a special train that travelled more than 2,000 km to a Russian installation for storage and disposal.
According to the officials, the second operation ended on Monday, and was made in aircraft.
The American government spent $13 million for the tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus the installation of investigations with low enrichment of uranium, which is suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official of the Department of Energy that works on reducing global threat, said that " this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence "that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of uranium for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will eliminate its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly due to the harsh repression of Lukashenko human rights.
But the statement on Wednesday suggested a potential distention.
Pleaded that "welcomes progress in these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of this country and its citizens'.
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights with Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners to Guantanamo by Spanish territory, as expressed in a telegram to the US ambassador in Madrid.
Reflect it documents leaked (cables by WikiLeaks) the newspaper the country, where it is said that the then First Vice-President of the government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish Executive was informed, "to be able to demonstrate that proper monitoring 91,392 on foreign aircraft cross Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, including Spain, there was a meeting between the former American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
Vice-President, acknowledged that the report by the council "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game " and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this.
"Vega emphasized that Spain is keen to flights of intelligence through Spanish territory."
" They simply want to be informed " to avoid being " caught napping " relate Aguirre in a cable.
Also the then incumbent of foreign affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish executive " wanted to give this issue the lowest profile possible, though, to be in the hands of judges, the government was limited in its ability to influence ."
For its part, in January 2007, the attorney Vincent gonzálezs transmitted to the embassy that would not try to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any elements incriminatorio or any sensitive information," explained the embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, U.S. reflected its concern about the " apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors Germans ," rather than by disclosure of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers complicate our efforts to handle the case tactfully between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007 in a lunch between the US ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are rabiosamente jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate ," he had given instructions to his collaborators" to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature.

The popular would win 4 seats in Congress, and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-n, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the important increase of votes and members experienced in the recent elections, the autonomic 475-84 catalán is already looking to the generals, because Hague advancement or not, the outlook is more positive because the number of votes that this training obtained in those elections usually double that receives in the Catalans.
So, the popular Catalans obtained 610.473 votes in general elections in 2008, while in the autonomic 2006, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the CFP logró 384.091 votes.
Kept this upward trend that has nourished a divert votes of the PSC and the loyalty of the electorate of the PP, of this training analysts have calculated that, if the general elections, the CFP could go from 8-12 deputies in Congress, while CiU also gain four (now has 10), and the PSC would lose nothing less that 9 members (25).
These calculations would ascertain that the Catalan square is crucial for the PP and the PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose an MEP - now has three - whereas CVI would be left with a gain. One MEP or
But kept the electoral calendar, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the local elections, where the popular can also be decisive in ending the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and his relief at the head of the regional government of Barcelona, one of the administrations that more budget handles - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
Both nationalists as popular agreement on the possibility of the PSC lose mairies Barcelona, Tarragona, Gerona and Lleida, where the Socialists would not obtain majority or the possibility of recourse to his traditional partners, ERC and CVI.
Given the Republican disaster, it would not be unreasonable that this training will lose their representation in the consistory barcelonan - need to get 5 per cent of the votes -.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and potentially decisive force in Barcelona and Lleida, Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced star power the dump tarraconense in the capital, where it ruled with the PP before the current Socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lleida, the PP has situated only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintained very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, were found in a number of occasions.
The popular have grown also in other important municipalities as Badalona, castelldefels or Reus.

The Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to al-Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona in Thailand were three
Seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the superintendent of the information from the police in Barcelona formed a jihadist cell, headed from Thailand, facilitated passports different groups of Al Qaeda, among them " The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba (LeT), author this last of the attacks in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Interior Ministry has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that the " Operation Kampai "has been" weakened, "the apparatus of counterfeiting of al-Qaeda" on the international level and, therefore, its operational capacity ."
The researchers calculated that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send out thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that make up the criminal Galaxy al-Qaeda for its' combatants' can cross European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The cell destamantelada is not the only one that the jihadist network was operational in Europe, which is why the investigations have participated, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units, so that it cannot be ruled out that in the territory of the EU are carried out in the coming days similar coups to developed on the night of last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (were arrested Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde agunbiade) in Thailand was another with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar butt and Zeeshan Ehsan butt and Thai sirikanlaya kijbumrung.
These were the running from Bangkok the cell based in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - stole mainly to tourists passports that complied with the requirements set by the so-called " Global Islamic Front. "
I.e. the documents should be on behalf of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a period of several years and without visas stamped.
In media research underlines that, for the moment, it has not found any data linking those arrested in Catalonia with the Mumbai attack, although the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba," has been one of the groups receiving passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before was committed this attack, from Catalonia were sent through an agency transfer of a few thousand dollars that were " invested " in buying mobile cards that were then used by members of the " commando " that claimed the life of 106 people.
The police has seized copious documentation.
The PP requires Mas that park the fiscal concert
The leader sqps, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had occasion yesterday of exposing him personally to Artur Mas their conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that summarizes in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and waive filo-soberanistas adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in Ecuador of its mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans went to the meeting of Artur Mas with security that gives to have obtained 18 MEPs in last Sunday " s elections, a figure that is more than enough to be wanting, since the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that exercised the opposition it abstain from the vote.
Of a possible entente with the PP depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to keep in the Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, talks that these days kept Mas with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan key.
And in regard to the president of the PP, to support an investiture "we will have to park all the speeches and pro-independence sovereigntists ," as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergent leader pretende even subjecting referendum.
Both leaders do have in common is their bet for thinning the political apparatus of an autonomic administration very inflated and the elimination of the inheritance tax and donations.
Of the details of the negotiations on the investiture of Mas will on the part of the CFP, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - that promised a hard opposition - Joan Smith (CVI) today and will do so with Joan puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta solidaritat (Catalan).
The social-geriatric contends that the deaths were not " lack of action "
The owners of the centre of Olot do not rule out that its very decrepit kills over 11 elderly
Duty-bearers social-geriatric of the caritat of Olot (Girona) offered yesterday a press conference to highlight the damage that he has caused to the institution the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila dilmé, the nurse that while I was there employee killed at least eleven elderly who was responsible.
The director of residence, Joan room, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, the lawyer Joan Glen, and announced that "the wish of the caritat would be able to exercise the indictment against responsible " for the deaths but" the legality and responsibility we have to assume the procedural position of responsible civilians. "
And that is in addition to the social prestige that can suffer the entity for not spotting time to the criminal activities of the prison guard, the big threat to the caritat earns now forms of fat compensation that are already estimating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila dilmé has confessed that the first crime can be traced back to August 2009, and that since then has not left to kill.
The judge already aimed at the car and ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients social-geriatric of - who suspected that, in many cases, any doctor explored personally to the dead, but, depending on the age and to pathologies of patients, dismissed the trámite by telephone.
The caritat, through its director, yesterday categorically denied this and pointed out that "the lack of action, he could not have been at any time in the cause of what has happened."
Counsel of caritat added that " in case there is not a single indication that there has been an imprudent action by any person other than the own person ."
The already baptised as " Angel of Death " he confessed to the 11 murders and detailed that the first crime committed it on 29 August 2009, for a month and a half later, killing a second grandmother.
In this case resulted in the death puncturing him an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime is committed helping a mixture of pills sedatives.
The director, is that it is complicated to control caritat that the staff have access to medicines.
The pricks of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives could have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in its efforts to alleviate the suffering of the displaced, used for killing them.
But the analyses that are being made in the laboratory which must clarify whether Vila do not lie and searched for their first victims a less cruel death or whether, on the contrary, the burned inside with bleach as already has confessed that it did with the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In caritat cannot give credibility to the demonstrations of the prison guard, or even the number of murders confessed, who did not rule out that it will be higher, and justify its attitude in the different versions which has given Vila on their visits to the court and in the little sense that has to change its approach after having committed, with success, eight murders.
Is why I say that it is available to justice to clarify the scope of this incident.
The ECB threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday the threat yesterday of Trichet warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react."
Peripheral spreads have closed with force and the actions of the European banks have risen more than 5 per cent.
However, we should not underestimate the capacity of the ECB to be wrong and the euro has scarcely rebounded which is a worrying signal.
What we have seen yesterday is a market ilíquido that like collapses recovers but motivated by closing of short positions and very speculative.
The institutional investor soon lose fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will retractar morning for the fourth time in two years and the remaining.
The Bundesbank demanded to finalise the plan of buying public debt by ineffective and eliminate all the extraordinary liquidity measures to term and leaving only unlimited access to week.
After the Irish crisis expect extended measures of current liquidity "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access to the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also expect to continue with its programme of purchases of bonds and even to give the signal of intensifying it.
If they do not comply with expectations reversed the excellent reaction of markets yesterday and stubborn if still in withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
Like at its meeting in May in which they said that they had not even contemplated buying bonds and markets collapsed, tomorrow could repeat history.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazuca Monday and Wednesday, said it had bought a lot, leading to a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday the auction of letters a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28 per cent, versus 750 million up 4.81% at the previous auction.
Yet the rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points in the entire curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, has made public the figures the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated figures are some 10,000 million short-term and other potential 15,000 and have until February to leverage private capital or be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detect the problem in July, with the stress test, the figures are achievable within the plan of aid and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will have to seek parliamentary approval for his new budget and still does not have sufficient support, so that Ireland remains a hotbed of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderate the tone of her speech, in order to ease the tension in the run-up to the forthcoming summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, at which it is necessary to a political compromise that will demonstrate that we are a Union, and that all touched the same hymn-sheet.
The problem is that Germany wants touch to Wagner and the rest the Ode to Joy by Beethoven.
In Spain, he had the gift of opportunity yesterday to submit the action plan to be adopted on Friday, the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revive employment are ringing in the ears of investors and four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen 4.5 per cent, double that of the rest of European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and strong and we are benefiting from the effect surprise.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit by the effect Trichet for what we hope will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain ask an aid plan would be a self-immolation.
We would provide a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury have more than $40 billion in available liquidity triple that in March, a very expensive types and closes you access to markets sine die.
However, the strategy must remain the Caesar's wife, "In addition, to be seen to be fair."
Spirit, we can.
Eulen will impugn the President of the board of Vega Sicily asked by their children
The storm continues unabated into open conflict in the family álvarezs, owners of eulen and Enebro.
David álvarezs, founder of the group, will impugn, as "null and void," the judicial board of the Enebro next day 16, requested by five of his seven children, and in which they will try to assert their majority and be done with the management bodies of signing holder of cellars Vega Sicily.
David álvarezs and their children Jesús David and Maria José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding of business services to the company did not seem willing to cede its dispute to be present in the bodies of government Enebro.
Its governing council was descabalgado by five of his seven children that were appointed administrators in the assembly of shareholders of 18 January this year and whose impugnation is annotated with the commercial register.
The judicial board Enebro of the next 16 for the day, convened by the judge of the Mercantile number 2 Madrid, has opened again unjspf the thunders within the family álvarezs.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira álvarezs mezquiriz, is described by David álvarezs as a "desperate, resort of requisitioners their five children for, through trickery procesal, clear law fraud and misfeasance, validate and improve the board radically invalid from 18 January," according to his official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis on which, once held the board, appropriate to his impugnation considering that it was "null and void."
The same protagonists, maintain a discreet silence, already tried without success that judge convened in June a board.
In Enebro society, property and holder of cellars Vega Sicily, among other assets, the seven children of David álvarezs control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the group for services claims, however, the use of the 51 per cent of the capital, according to the protocols families.68.
This matter is the issue of substance which must decide the judge once hearing on the legal challenge, for which there is still significant date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in cars in real time.
Since red bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, her history in the select universe of speed has been marked by the surprise and success.
Initially nobody considered the options of a escudería recently arrived and, despite the upward trajectory of past seasons, last November, in the home straight of the championship all bet by the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without disregarding the skill as pilot of the champion finally, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that powers your car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull into a winning team.
It is really a powerful software to simulate processes which the German put on the market in 2007 with purposes far removed from the high car competition.
Sea-kaunlaran PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design chains of rig-up of manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate of faithful form the product or process before build it so right, avoiding this way judgements and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of cameras of Canon, the Sukhoi aircraft or utilitarian cars more famous of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, the industrial division of Siemens, said that the use of this software tool in his factory Formula 1 has allowed Red Bull design and implement "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements detected during careers and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the escuderías in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in his team were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in the vehicles during each season.
In the Red Bull team are working today 180 young professionals of high qualifications that, equipped with powerful hardware, analysed and projected all kinds of changes in the fireballs.
The manager of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyse and improve all aspects of the fireballs of Red Bull with the exception of an engine, that it is entirely the responsibility of Renault.
Modify the materials, fuel, aerodynamics and in the safety elements.
Changes can carry the virtual reality simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production system and laser autoclaves of high technology.
As only limitation of this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million that each team of Formula 1 can spend a maximum at each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the factory of high technology to design and produce their fireballs in a village some 50 miles from London.
Two buildings in which are restricted visits, especially for journalists.
Everything that there becomes is considered "top secret."
The template for this purpose amount to 580 people, including the two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Formula 1 Red Bull, it is without doubt the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energetic drinks he has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, hide other players whose support is invaluable and his invalid notoriety.
The head of technology to the factory, Steve nevey, said that five years ago, one could say that the progress of R [amp] D in cars of carts contributed 50 percent of the victories and pilots are responsible for the remainder.
Today these percentages have varied and technology amount, 85 per cent of success, while the pilots contribute 15% of the value added.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber will never be replaced by Informatics as' gladiatorial are unpredictable. "

Sabadell bet 'steal' one million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic that other directors, the counsellor delegate of bank Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola believes that 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and is predicting the end of the war of liabilities.
Despite this, expected a collapse of interest margins, that it will try to compensate in part by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract in three years a million private customers, its asignatura pending.
Sabadell had found a way to exploit the next three years, and thus be able to survive in a very difficult economic environment.
The bank to be launched in 2011 a new master plan that will run for three years.
The aim, in addition to survive without the need for public aid of the Frob, is winning market share, with the capture of a million new private customers -700.000 if discount that can leave the banco-, his big challenge, since, until now, had pampered more to SMEs and companies that the retail client.
This year has attracted 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share in individuals is 3.5 per cent, while in companies exceeds 10 per cent.
Another of the foundations for the 2011-2013 plan is the wager for productivity, which is to say, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges the expose the bank when present the results of the exercise.
Few banks dare in these times to set targets and to make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the banking world.
Sabadell, indeed, will close this year, his plan director Optima set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the situation of the markets meant that it will expand an exercise more.
Customers to leave to escape the savings banks will be its main goal.
At a breakfast organized by the apie, Guardiola insisted that 2011 is going to be a "difficult year." And trascendental
The executive, in fact, believe that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be slow. "
In addition, in two or three years will be " very difficult to create jobs, which is critical to the survival of the banking business, insisted.
And, although he believes that the war of the liabilities - which criminalizes the márgenes- is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and boxes for its emissions to obtain liquidity are moving already the cost of credit in order to compensate for the fall in the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and the financing is structural, and is going to be a factor of pressure on the credit. "
"We have not shut the tap, but the differences are highest," conceded Guardiola.
Banesto already gave on Thursday orders to its network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -ver CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
Also acknowledged that the trend in the banking system is now "up committees ," but " there is a competitive framework."
The plan director of Sabadell is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not in vain, ensures that Spain "is going to require sizes higher."
"Next year is going to change everything," he assured.
Alleges that capital requirements are "gone up enormously" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial entity between in red numbers.
And aims that the FROB could fill the market in fund-raising before new recapitalizations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, belittled what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
Said that it cannot issue, but the opposite of what happened in June, was unable to obtain financing in the short term through repos, which cushion the crisis.
The ECSC rule out a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that it is going to be a wave of mergers savings banks and re-emphasized the speed with which it is implementing the restructuring of the sector.
When it started the process of concentration of the boxes of Spanish savings, were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in the first phase and that would be set aside for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of savings banks (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, dismissed yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I believe that the largest part of mergers has been done, the incorporation of cajasol the group of civic banking it cannot be said to be a second round, there are adjustments. "
"The greatest party is entirely done; it may be that instead of 17 go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes already been achieved and protected by the Bank of Spain, that has worked great, too," said the manager.
In statements during a breakfast meeting the Association of managers and executives of Aragon (ADEA) Olavarrieta, has stated that the process of concentration is tackling "the greatest speed possible, and we must be very pleased, as is happening in the deadlines that, in their day, not now, marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
" spend 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 million volume of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that is unprecedented in history, reducing the number of entities at 62% to be much larger to fulfil bâle, "he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that " there are a number of views quite little lucky on the slow process "that demonstrate a" lack of seriousness and sense " because " what the Bank of Spain is to remember that we have to be within the period before the end of the year. '
The director general of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the more rigorous financial system of the whole of Europe and " probably " of the world, and attributed to those who questioned a "lack of knowledge."
The director pointed out that, in the current economic downturn, "we have to be very calm" with the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, a system that has embarked on a process of concentration "very important" and that "it is going to the greatest possible speed."
Also recalled that the Spanish banking left very well stop of the stress tests that the ECB took in July.
Zapateros and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set up the conditions for the entire Union.
Tensions in the markets had led to a double governmental answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax cuts to SMEs, regulation of private agencies of placement or deletion of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without provision, until privatization 49-per AENA (Spanish cent, of the management of the airports of stir and Prat and 30 per cent of the state lotteries.
By another Elena Salgado, the vice-president, with the support of the former president, Felipe Gonzalez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in triggering the current crisis.
How we interpret these movements?
It goes without saying that the position of Merkel is not an error in his communicative politics.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And that Germany has a radically new vision of what should be their future, which is at odds with the maintenance of the old traditions of a good portion of its partners.
Off the European resistance, in Germany begins to especularse on the three possible exits for the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by herself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the euro zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now seem science fiction, with a current of opinion favorable, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the proposals Germanas greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines on the errant countries, potential defaults of any of them and outreach to the private sector for the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defining since some time ago, so now there is no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government was pulled out of the ether, a constitutional amendment to prevent that from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed that must be (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances, and what were practising its European partners, including France.
The second in the front brought the country central-european when Merkel lengthened distressingly the decision to rescue Greece.
Already then was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and were published very against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, again Merkel surfaces with a clear position, calling for the reform of the Treaties of the Union, to make possible the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing the private lenders to cover part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat watered down, it has been adopted, and in the months ahead, we should assist in the process of reforming the Union that allows those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line not to cross. Thinks
And he is telling us all that, even now have to take measures which perhaps is not very much in agreement, from that date the ancient operation of the euro, it will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the countries offenders will be severely punished, they may be forced to confess on suspension of payment and, in this case, the private sector also pays part of the cost.
Germany is signalling us that we must follow a severe way of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in the consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, which has chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated. The
The challenge is clear.
And would do badly in understanding.
It is not only a question of putting the public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What we require is much more severe.
And worse than in these circumstances could do is fool ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will cease step to greater tranquillity.
And to use the window of opportunity that we have been given, until the spring of 2013.
Zapateros also believe that the president has understood this and its double apparent (the reforms pledged after the meeting last Saturday with big business and the announcement yesterday of new measures) suggested that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, has opened the way to the theory that there must be an order at home.
But the red line that Germany has charted there is, and it seems that the going to shake.
And, among the possibilities covered, leaving a monetary zone too atiborrada of countries little serious, it could not be excluded.
Then, Germany always we can say that we already had warned.
Sport and fraud law
Wiles as Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax show ingenuity but will escape a sanction.
Expulsion allegedly concocted by two players Real Madrid, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party contested 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League has caused rivers of ink to write about if such behaviour is unsporting and if eventually both players had to be sanctioned by Uefa.
As is well known, to the lack of a few minutes to finish the match, which his team clearly had won), the two players deliberately lost time in minor-offence paths draw to provoke that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will finish as the leader of their group, both players met the statutory sanction the next party of liguilla, against Auxerre, and can clean pass cards to the next phase.
Finally, the disciplinary committee of Uefa has punished with two parties to the team's coach, José Mourinho, with different economic quantities to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but more often in the world of football.
Is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of the unwritten rules, but followed, this sport.
Part of the debate emerged in the case chronicled is because it has been carried out by a team of the entity (which, in the Real Madrid his hymn boasts of nobility and honour, and in the past has fined his players by analogous acts) and dramatization orchestrated apparently by mourinhos, who adds an episode more to its long history of technical histriónico and provocative.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of behaviour does not specifically prohibited by the rules of procedure it contradicts the principles of sport, that is to say, whether with these actions committed fraud of law; as, indeed, are respectful actions with the rules of sport, but seem to evade their meaning.
The question is to look at the kind of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets comprising the sportsmanship is the physical integrity of the contrary players, which with these actions was not in danger, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets which were referred to the clean game is to avoid that, the team of players infractores is profiting unfairly of the opposing team, which neither occurred.
However, the paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is not accommodated to what usually characterise as trap or fraud of law, for their violation of the rules had not been made in secret in order to try to avoid punishment, but that his action tried to be as clear to well receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
Expected and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what advantage wood2 offenders in the intentional faults examined.
Here seems to be said that it is not placed at a disadvantage to the rival or obtains profit in the same party, obviously the result of the action mean leaving the own team with fewer players.
And is not a useful strategy for the next party because the club will not be able to count on such players.
The advantage, of course, is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten his participation in a future party.
But this is an advantage over the long term, with a degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be removed in the first change, and also with this performance the players meet a party penalty and spend the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension for accumulation of cards comes with one less than in the first round.
So that, flicking through rounds, it is not so clear that it will be an advantage.
Ultimately, these actions do not go against the spirit of sportsmanship, which itself forms part take strategic decisions that favor the maximization of what allow the rules.
In the case before us, the players did not act to avoid the implementation of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when undergo it.
Took a strategic decision without evade punishment or flee the same.
Although the border between genius and Fraud Act is diffuse, on this occasion I believe that this was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems, stems by two factors: because it was two autoexpulsiones and by the way in which it conducted the transmission of guideline of such deaths.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not only ethical as aesthetic.

The Pakistani nuclear program generates great concern in U.S.
Islamabad produce atomic arms to " a faster rate than any other country. "
Leaks of WikiLeaks confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan, and the US State Department, filtered by the portal WikiLeaks confirms the enormous concerns that causes in Washington the Pakistani nuclear program.
Outside the enlightening and offering substantial details on the content of the talks and the thoughts of representatives diplomats accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of going on the rise, " fall ," and that the unstable Asian country produce nuclear weapons, "a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but are stored by components to hamper their destruction if ataque-- constitutes one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
So lists ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the then national security adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumoreada spread of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is viewed, not just by America, but also for Russia, as proliferante and a reason to maintain the guard.
" Pakistan has had to recruit staff with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the collapse of the educational and cultural levels, extremist organisations have more opportunities of recruiting people to work in the nuclear programmes or missiles, "said the expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian foreign ministry, in a meeting with their American counterparts.
The newest of documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on issues of nuclear proliferation and the Pakistani high pace of production of nuclear weapons.
A cable from the embassy in May, which it describes as " frustrating " communication with Pakistan, he argues: "Transparency is frequently non-existent; program-offerings help unchallenged or are dismissed."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, the national intelligence officer for South Asia, noted that " despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world ."
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, who left "very clear" to the responsible that "the Army of Pakistan must end with the tacit support to terrorist groups."

Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements ." Assange
However, this is not an arrest warrant. Traditional
Furthermore, it is not new, but that dates from 20 November.
And has nothing to do with the last leak of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents but with allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Furthermore, counsel of the creator of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange."
Was the day 20 when the international police body headquartered in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but not revealed until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of that country.
Predissolution the 188 countries of Interpol have indications identify or locate Assange 'with a view to their arrest and extradition. "provisional
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of a person hit by a red alert, with many of the Member States, as it has explained the organization, Yes consider the so-called network notice free to proceed to an arrest -- is facing national police of the body, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
Ismun has outraged lawyers of Assange that yesterday published a letter denouncing that WikiLeaks founder of 39 years, said he was willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
Recall also that Assange requested and received permission to leave Sweden of the prosecutor of the case, which they compare with the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich the Berias, head of security for Stalin.
"This seems a hunting, not a legal persecution," denounces the circular.
While the world search - and since Australia his mother defends innocence Assange hijo-- his fate remains unknown, but not silent.

"If you can show that he was responsible for ordering diplomats Americans who spied in the UN, in violation of international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign," he said.
Their opinion was much-maligned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, which he characterized as a "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am not quite sure why we must import the opinion of a kind, with a website," he told CNN.
The own Obama has commissioned a senior official of the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, to prevent further escapes of documents.
The attempt of the spokesman of President Barack Obama of belittling Assange contrasts with views that these days stated.135. politicians and conservative commentators.
Peter King, the congressman that from January will chair the national security committee in the lower house, has asked the State Department to consider include WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organisations " to intervene and its funds and prosecute any that any contribution or help ."
Further still has gone Tom Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who has had to retract after Assange say that "should be killed."
"Obama should make it objective and using a unmanned aircraft or something ."
Who excused was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former deputy governor of Arkansas and possible candidate for the presidency.
" Whoever is in government that leaked information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be too kind a punishment, "he declared in the chain Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winks to fine-tune to carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret ballot on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the system assembly's.
Joan puigcercós seems to have found the recipe for circumventing the umpteenth internal uprising in the ranks of ERC, without north for the loss of 11 members, and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that its false resignation is insufficient for the Allied ex-leader Josep Lluís carod-rovira, but they also know that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as his own mentor and that can cause him the headaches that had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of, Esquerra will try to win at the new critics with winks to armour until the municipal elections.
For starters, puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national advisers of ERC may pronounce on their continuity in secret.
By ballot, not hands.
If the carodistas vehicular want some vote of punishment to the president, will be able to do so without fear of reprisal.
In fact, the chief of ranks wants to avoid the image of division as subjection to her person.
In a number of interviews, he said that it is not ratified with more than half of the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a "good result." The Bulgarian
The next to carod require the president more than put his post before militancy, a gesture that is not worth when puigcercós controls the maximum organ between Congresses.
But in the absence of sufficient majority to force resignations, will try to agree with the executive a roadmap by May.
To this end, expect to participate in the elaboration of strategic reorientation that the management will be put to a vote of the National Council on day 18.
Its intention is endorsing puigcercós to change that this promise to advance the Congress in the fall of 2011, something that the Dome is already done.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that " polyphony " harms stability and that its aim is to ensure that, once and for all, the organization is able to wash the dirty cloths of doors towards within.
In this line, it is symptomatic article that the conseller in functions Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologist of puigcercós Holder innovació taken for granted that the leader will be endorsed " a change of various objectives. "
And listed five, two stand out.
The first, " restoring " the executive to represent at least 90% of militancy, i.e. include new faces that sector non-oil-for-food akin to carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that ERC Liquide once the asambleísmo as a mechanism of operation.
So, advocates a reform of the constitution that would allow for the Congresses through elected delegates by voting.
End the assembly's model, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, it has been an obsession of the task puigcercós, that already battled in this regard in the past two Congresses.
Indeed, the conclave frenetic 2008 left instructing the direction of revising the asambleísmo in a specific Congress to reform statutes.
This quotation remains pending, because the internal tide of recent years to address the matter. Schemes militated against
Now, without critical sectors lurked, may be a good time to pick it up and try to screw forever.

Promotes Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If coincide to approve the law Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to approve is legislation," tweeteó the president estadunidense in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined today at national movement in support of the Dream Act, a bill to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If coincide to approve the law Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and urge them to approve is legislation," tweeteó Obama.
His brief message keeps open a liaison of cybercrime with a wider document that requests the public immediately contact senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard," says.
The message was issued after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless approve the extension of the tax cuts of the Bush era and the financing of government.
Such blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the law Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the New Start treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blockade to law Dream Act and other projects, the presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs hoped that once we solve the tax issue, it may set a timetable for the rest of the projects.
"I believe that there is a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the issue of tax before the end of the year... "
"I believe that we can reach an agreement at some point in this, and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democrat majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday it would seek a "vote of closure of debate" for the Dream Act law, for which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The senatorial version of the Dream Act or Act of American dream would legalise about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before age 16, had remained in the country in the past five years and had been admitted to an institution of higher education or the army.
But supporters needed 60 votes to approve the initiative, which will require the support of a handful of Republicans, with organizations supporting the Star project an intense lobbying to ensure the adoption of the law.
Democrats, most of whom supported the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said it would vote against it and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard place of Indiana.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act require to add to several Republicans in the event that other Democrats choose to ignore the initiative.
Between Republicans more cortejados are the senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the salient Senator George LeMieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported in the past, the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that we do not support on another occasion.
That supported another Republican, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature in it put the finger on the sore
The second round of the pleasures of language was a walk where participants displayed narration
'that of the sex in the language I understand but... the finger? what is expected of me?, "asked the Writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of the pleasures of the language, which is celebrating the cycle to literature in English and that this occasion used the subtitle of your question (in another fair the panel discussion was devoted to the sex in language, explained).
The finger... "we are in trouble," espetó dulcemente the Argentinian writer to the public, mostly of young people, which was quoted in the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to hear this panel moderated by Marisol Shultz and where participated valenzeula, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text devoted to Gonzalo celorio and Shultz would define after as a great tale, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist that in search of the know the "sore," goes medical doctor in, not getting replies yes runways in the same narrative thread.
Of infectólogo sale convinced: "patience is not my strong, perhaps my sore."
At the end, after a frustrated rapprochement with the traumatologist that has stolen him encouragement in the middle of the aisle, but he clarified that Pulse is not a scientific term, it is the psicoanalista who reveals the mystery: "The sore is the real, the symbolic open is the scar."
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded " sore only attained know that it is the real open and that there is no ," but believes that the joys and the pitfalls of the language must be very interlinked.
Valenzeula, the writer, played with both.
The nicaragüense Sergio Ramírez also exposed a deleitosa storytelling that titled praise of invention, where the finger is not named but at a time turns up.
With smatterings of magic realism, account of a famous hechicera, which likewise touched clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that have lost a Doncella, narrating that shifted to speak then America, the big novel that is not failed from the beginning its own chroniclers that explained it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticise the excesses of the conquerors. Calculée by captains
Cervanteses "we invented all (the writers) made a mockery of the sham witnesses tribunal-related The stories presented as real, but another way would never have come to tell the story of America, with imagination which lacked until modesty ."
However, he stressed " are the crazy and peddled the best imagine " and is where converges reality and lie, where it is no longer known what told belongs to one side or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogee.

Know that this series could be defined in penal shots, something that is not concerned, because he trusts his players: "One never search reach the batch of criminal, one search finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other, and we need to be prepared, in the previous tournament were prepared, unfortunately did us a bad game destination, sometimes by nerves or the anxiety of taking the title in the hands, but were US, that left us something to this end which we hope will not reach this instance ."
Romano has in its hands stop being a technician subcampeón and prove for the first time the glory that Dan titles.

May struggle against illegal migration without problems
The bill of the Conservatives that the government should address the problem of boats loaded of clandestine migrants, probably will face a strong opposition since the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
" I am speaking primarily on the letter. "
"I am here with a party that has created the granite that step," said the Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly meeting of the caucus.
Liberals defend that the bill in its current form, which would stop up to a year to anyone who engages a vessel identified as transport of illegal immigrants, violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the bloc in Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it aims at the wrong target.
"We are against it, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government is doing," declared Mr Duceppe.
Criticism of the NPD in the field of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism of a stroke that they point out that his party is not sufficiently firm with clandestine immigrants.
"neodemócratas agree that measures should be taken against those responsible for the rafts of clandestine and that is what we intend with another bill, the c-35," says Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill because of the Conservatives attacking refugees and incarcerates children for at least a year," explains Mrs Chow.
The minister of immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the party of the political position of playing and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians said to MEPs that do not tolerate this type of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and who treat the country as a doormat."
"Expect Canada take some firm measures," believes the minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the bill, which could lead the country to the polls as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the government would call a vote so that every member will oppose explain to their electorate. After
The new unit fails to unanimity
Despite had announced the possible creation of a permanent unit to fight against corruption and the collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a commission of public consultation on the issue.
The minister of public security, Robert dutil supports this idea, which has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York is question since January last year.
The metropolis possesses a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, the announcement on Tuesday, has come as a great surprise to more than one.
It can be said that, during a meeting of the permanent council on police services of Quebec held last 29 October, never debated this measure despite the presence of Robert dutil.
That was sufficient for the critical quebequense party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, described the announcement as "a rabbit out of the basket," and as "a solution." Last-minute slapdash
The minister dutil, for its part, has responded to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"will see results when announce it," simply indicates.
"We are aware of this problem. "
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean parent, there is nothing that can replace the launching of a public inquiry.
"The more it persists Mr Charest in avoiding the creation of this committee of inquiry, more people share our opinion, that is to say, that he has something to hide," explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is through the resignation of Jean Charest," explained Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Administration.
To get out of this impasse, suggested to Quebec that given a special mandate to the comptroller general to carry out a survey on the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the comptroller general," concludes.
Also believes that Quebec could grant the comptroller the same skills that a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent group is not the only project in the fledgling government. Charest
Quebec also seeks to Ottawa to amend the penal code to be better suited to this type of crime.
This request seems to proceed by the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, which has informed the Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this type of research.
The Federal Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews, has confirmed that his counterpart of justice, Rob Nicholson inclines currently by performing certain amendments in relation to this subject.
During Operation spring 2001 related to the groups of moteros, although not had adapted the penal code, were arrested 131 people.
Later, Ottawa promoted the adoption of the law on gangsterism.

"My file is clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the committee denounces the issuance of earthy language.
In any case, the chain of radio choi-fm has collaborated "even more than what is required."

The athlete, that stresses "Sanda " (kung-fu " full contact "), kickboxing and and Thai box, rises to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started to practice martial arts as the kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to move the professional level.

"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," explained.
'currently prepare me to participate in the World Cup in China. "St. Shou
"will invite athletes who have completed between the first four seats in the last World Cup in each category."
"In 2009, won the bronze medal in Toronto."
" in 2005, in Vietnam, finished in eighth place. "
"In 2007, in China, finalised the tournament in fifth place, but achieved the third post in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What is interesting is that I have been progressing in each competition."

450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts at a value of $450 million to engineering companies for the hydroelectric project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
At the centre of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium of businesses RPGs, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a previous bidding the contract more important, the management of the project, for a sum of $295 million.
The consortium, called énergie gérance, was created in 2004 as a result of the decision of Hydro-Québec of entrust the private sector responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project 5,000 million.
In early 2005, the consortium énergie gérance won the lucrative contract without previously realised a public tender.
For the party quebequense, recourse to consortia of enterprises presents a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and eliminate competition ."
"That is to say, the people in place to do so in secret, now do it openly," he declared yesterday, the member of the party quebequense Sylvain Simard in a press conference.
Earlier, in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly, because, according to him, did not understand how they can be of benefit to the public interest in this way.
The minister of natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded afternoon, strongly denied that there has been collusion with this contract.
"I am beginning to tire me," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted as "dishonest" and "lack of rigour." With
Noted that " the minimum "would be that the PQ you apologised.
The formula of consortia is a common practice in the world.
Usually, it is a partnership with a temporary limit which allows two or several companies cluster their knowledge to respond to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The project Eastmain shows a high level of complexity, bearing in mind the magnitude of the work.
Work has already begun and will run until 2012.
In the entire case, the contract has been awarded without entering game competition; this has been a negotiation.
Furthermore, the formula of the consortiums has left to be the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for projects relatively straightforward.
As published last week Le Devoir, the formula of pools in the area of technical advice is being subjected to an investigation in the government.
A quick look at the commercial register of Quebec allows for the identification of more than 200 firms, some of which appear to be permanent.
The Dessau company works in partnership with the majority of its competitors, as top +, génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leading to a single entity, i.e. Dessau.
As regards consortium énergie gérance, Normandeau minister has stressed that "the territory of the Bay James replied to a dynamic of manpower particular and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s."
The great project leader Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie of Ireland James (sebj), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the contract for the management of the project has been awarded directly.
" If you answer a tender and there are few players, your prices are going to be higher. "
"You have two options: you can come in contact with the players in the sector, and to say: we are going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price ."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but also the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract awarded to the consortium énergie gérance form part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 from the party quebequense.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or sebj for the project eastmain-1-a-sarcelle-rupert.
After the audit, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular laboratories. Geotechnical
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, génivar achieved 16, tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in énergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, amount to $449.783.344, including the contract for énergie gérance of 295.131.564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has given to understand that the four companies that form the consortium (RPGs, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are " good acquaintances of the Liberal Party of Quebec. "
The minister Normandeau has dropped the PQ is also linked to these companies, which " finance ," before specifying that it is more of their leaders.
Barometer of consumption responsible. The "green" label inspires no confidence
More ecological, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer quebequense just hoped actors of sustainable development, as well as in trademarks of fair trade and ecological certificates to guide their elections.
As the barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is submerged in a media universe where swarming messages advocating a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information, and considered that even brakes their commitment.
Even if increased consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the quebequenses seem to be giving too little credit to those who are trying to sell.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they are not confident the environmental commitment of the companies or in advertising environmentalists, reveals the measuring tool developed by i.3.7 the responsible consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers questioned the reliability of the official certificates bearing just called products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands carried labels stating that they are "ecorresponsables ," notes the barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of those quebequenses taken seriously politicians' speeches on this issue.
In any case, the information on the responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector consumption, underpinned by nearly a third of consumers quebequenses.
In fact, the gaps and the questionable nature of the information means that 46 per cent of consumers refuse this option.
It is the second barrier identified by the barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of the quebequenses say beware also of alleged returns of products or ecological services that tries them sell.
Moreover, nearly half of consumers have changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61 per cent, has given priority to purchases in shops in his neighbourhood and has preferred to buy food grown in the region, said. The barometer
Greener and responsible (the contents of the responsible consumption has reached 64 points on a maximum 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec adores the position of king of recycling it tries to reduce its impact on the environment be concerned about the protection of fauna.
However, the barometer, this social consciousness seems doors (his car) outside: in 2010, only 28 per cent of the quebequenses indicated that he used public transport or have shared car to defend its principles. Environmentalists
Furthermore, 39.1 per cent of the participants of this wide survey of conduct, which has just completed its first edition, supports cycling and walking.
A loan to restore state excentris
The government of Quebec, which have been asked to commit financially in the recovery of the complex of cinemas excentris pursuit Société Angus and Parallèle, accepts collaborate, but only through a loan.
Société de développement Angus and Parallèle expecting a donation of seven million from the ministry of culture to return to buy Daniel Langlois the complex excentris film on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and restore his true vocation cinéfila, have not obtained what sought.
The government has agreed to become involved in the matter, but in their own conditions.
Instead of the donation as expected, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would, in fact, short of initial expectations. This could be a viable solution at advantageous conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected the spring a first action plan, and a request for $12.8 billion, but since then the requests had been revised downwards.
The chairman of Société de développement des Entreprises culturelles (sodec), François macerola, which champions the file of excentris, forwarded a proposal and a plan of action to the minister. St-Pierre
Has bowled a final report makes a dozen days.
However, the sodec received a counterproposal of the Cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus they have until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, believe that it should be scrapped entirely the possibility of a donation from the state.
Remember that the association of owners of cinema and cinematographic complexes of Quebec opposed a direct investment of the state to support the recovery of excentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance building projects, as it has done with other cinemas.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector Yes demand considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, owner of the same, has carried for ten years the burden of cinema in their premises, after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation on the part of the Council to the Treasury.
Lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and excentris had known fidelizar to their clientele.
The company Angus and Parallèle, directed by Christian yaccarini, pushing for their part in a campaign of funding privately, hoping to collect $700,000 for open path to the acquisition.
Since spring of 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallèle, still projecting films in excentris.
The objective of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms the next 27 February, projecting the lovely film of Xavier Beauvois " Des Hommes et Des Dieux ."
However, Christian yaccarini has failed to contact Le Devoir and we do not know what opinan him and his group of proposals downwards that they have received.
The veil of Canada rose given complex...
The new American diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regarded as the complex of Canadians with regard to the Americans, but they reflect the feeling of superiority of recent towards Canada.
Let American diplomats are shocked that the Canadian constituents do not think in relationships canadá-estados when you are going to vote, and that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, offered rather substantial details that content really substantial.
A wire on 22 September 2008, i.e. during full federal electoral campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States do not fall within the issues discussed by the political leaders.
This provoked great surprise to us ambassador sent Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provided some explanations regarding this situation.
" Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent to the Canadians to deal with the daily domestic questions, instead of leaving the choice to the United States (as during the campaign on free trade of 1988), "he writes.
Therefore, it concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it. "
Ambassador has yet more problems in understand this "deafening silence" because the two countries have some intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor which should think the voters when it comes to the vote. "
Can observe this feeling of importance also the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during a vote of confidence early February on the federal budget, which Canada a record deficit for the first time in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between 30,000 and 40,000 million," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid that substituted him iwhc nor that opposition parties conditioned its survival to the quality of the recovery plan proposed.
Another communication of January 2008 signed by Ambassador Wilkins alert to Washington on the increasingly negative image that broadcast drama series broadcast in the United States. CBC
Ambassador is concerned the emission of border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, intelligence and H2O, at little subtle references to Maher Arar, to "no-fly-list " or even kidnapping to the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another wire account that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be prepared to host some of the Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner responded that yes, but it depended "of each case."
At the end of the meeting, wrote "has handed a document to the secretary of state in respect of Omar Khadr, a Muslim 15 years of Canadian origin. "
"The Secretary accepted to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that have heated tempers in connection with the Web site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, a former councillor very near to Stephen Harper, said in the radio of CBC that responsible for this massive escape "should be murdered."
In America echo Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN has proposed a plan in Cancún renewal domestic illumination, trade and industry in a hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) in an amount that is almost a third of the additional decrease that must be carried out to stabilise the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan was part of a series of large concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancún, in order to compensate for the lack of binding commitments reduction in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent light bulbs, that still monopolise between 50 and 70 per cent of the market, should be replaced by bulbs fluocompactas or, even better, by bulbs of diodes electroluminescentes (or "LEDs" in Spanish), avoiding much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) GHG issued in the planet to enlighten humans.
Lighting is responsible of 8 per cent of global emissions.
Is equivalent to 70% of emissions of planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitting countries, including the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, pledged with workplans voluntary reduction that should diminish global GHG emissions of 53 gtco2 to 49. Gtco2
However, should diminish even 5 gtco2 this amount to stabilise, before 2020, the increase in temperature by two degrees Celsius to avoid control.
In the incandescent light bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, that is to say 5 per cent, generates light.
In the case of the bulbs fluocompactas, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75 percent and with the new light bulbs led, reduces still two times more energy consumption.
The bulbs fluocompactas lasts an average of 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, which has launched the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that, in addition, has participated in the survey by the UN), and have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80 per cent less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives a clear sense of the savings that can be achieved with the substitution plan to be implemented in one hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also operate with reóstatos and emit very little heat.
Above, do not contain any mercury. Nothing
Various specialists have expressed their reservations concerning fluocompactas the bulbs, which contain mercury and that should be eliminated as hazardous waste, which it is not always possible in the developing countries, except for the manufacturers to put instructions.
However, the report indicates, the main source of emissions of mercury in the planet are not the bulbs fluocompactas, but the coal power stations, which emit a large quantity of mercury to produce the electricity that squanders with the incandescent light bulbs.
Only in the United States, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury each year.
The report details the advantages of this international program to each country.
Indonesia, for example, in this way would save about $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, that is to say, the equivalent of 3.5 power stations whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaiting the announcement of the election results
The secretary-general of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, has requested 'immediate' the publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast, because they have expired deadlines.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results immediately," emphasized a spokesperson for the head of the UN.
'calls on all the parties in Ivory Coast and institutions to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until results are announced ." Provisional
Despite the pressure exerted by some foreign governments, the Electoral Commission has left to turn the deadline of Wednesday at midnight without publish results, three days since the scrutiny of Sunday.
Around forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CIS had commented on television that the Commission was still "working" to announce the results.
Wednesday have multiplied in the world the requests that the CIS proclaim finally the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Alassane Ouattara. Its opponent
However, the edict of Gbagbo account with the annulment by the constitutional council votes "fraudulent" in the north, in the hands of the former rebels of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the campaign by the president of Ivory Coast, has said that the manoeuvres of voter intimidation made by FN in the north of the country had deterred followers of the outgoing president to go to vote.
The entire election might be overturned if the Constitutional Council accepts complaints by Gbagbo.
Now, opponents of Gbagbo believe that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is directed by Paul Yao N'dré as, a near political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the North who deny any relationship with the former rebels, has judged "unacceptable" the delay in the publication of the results, and has called on Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
Its allies claim that Gbagbo has blocked the publication of the results, because he knows that he has lost and file a complaint with the Constitutional Council having prevented the electoral commission the dissemination of the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of presidential elections on Sunday, was due to put the icing on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two years ago. Since
The United Nations has warned the Wednesday to the political class in Ivory Coast who could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes compared to 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who was publicly the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).

Matter Clotilde Reiss: the Élysée Palace has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," has been on edge to the public in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of diplomats from the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown appearances this crisis.
Described how the Élysée Palace has explained its strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them tips on how to manage their own crisis of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of senderistas).
Show how the French managers tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youngster there was in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian arrested in France and sought by the American justice by traffics of material for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally reveal the harsh reality of how the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar al-Assad, had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, did nothing.
A diplomatic telegram drafted the 12 August 2009 in Paris carried the title " Iran: French comments on how to deal with cases of hostage-taking. "
The counsellor to the Élysée Palace for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, converse with the diplomatic American Kathleen allegrone.
Explain the French method.
Advise the Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens to force in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "continuously soltad" in the media the words' fundamental human rights ,"" innocence ,"" immediate release ."
All to embarrass the Iranian regime, careful of their image.
"When Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often." still
Because, once exhausted attempts at negotiation by discreet channels, " silence will not solve anything, "the Iranians are" delaying tactics ."
Mr Richier added that the detention of foreign nationals is "an usual Iranian tactics: hostage-taking to political blackmail."
Announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will happen on August 16, the day on which it will take refuge at the French Embassy) "will require the compost Iranians of a large amount of money " (230,000 euros reward).
Moreover, said that the Élysée Palace anticipates other hostage crisis, a phenomenon that is going to increase. ""
Iranians could "in the near future to stop another nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison after 12 days, but it is blocked in Iran.
Disseminates following information: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition request the United States for smuggling of delicate electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by the decision of a judge.
The American Embassy, like many observers, doubt this odd coincidence.
For Washington, which is near the Iranian clandestine networks acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the release of Majid khakavand constitutes bad news.
Has accepted France an exchange?
May liberate the changing Iranian French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen allegrone, on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
The Élysée Palace, he argues, not only is "very surprised by the judge's decision," but has tried to resist the same.
" There have been intensive negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice " (in the Times, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but " the French government cannot reverse the decision, "he says. Judicial
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under "close 'monitoring of information services. French
The councillor for Eliseo marks a telephone number, hang and then informed the diplomatic American that the Iranian "is currently in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo spared no efforts, and uses comunicados "leakage" organized in the media to pretend that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has a role, "important" and "influential" from "mediator."
Americans watching this activity with some irony and checked that the manipulation brings fruit, since several press articles broadcast the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the 'blitz' mediático of the French officers."
Why such " gratitude " towards Mr Assad, wondered the embassy in Paris.
" despite their declarations full of praise, the French officials acknowledge in private that only have a vague idea of what it has actually done it. "the Syrians
Below, the document addresses the reasons that have led the Eliseo to lead to this fiction.
The great effort of communication " is intended to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria, "believes.
A policy initiated in 2008, that " in the opinion of many critics in France and abroad, had just be criticized as premature and desmerecida. "
To "exaggerate the Syrian paper," Paris tries to 'show Syria the praise that can harvest if it plays a constructive role in the region ."
The goal also is to " sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran. "
The American Embassy knows of good source.
On 11 August, François Richier charter-granted: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But anyway, we have obliged. "
"At least, this should cause confusion among Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace. Receives
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syrian have played an " active role in favour of the release of our compatriot. "
From midnight, young Koreans cannot play online
The South Korean government is going to adopt a law called " Cinderella " that prevents adolescents participate in online games after midnight to block their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to parliament for asking companies of online games that block access to these games after midnight to youth under the age of 16, according to have indicated representatives of the ministries of culture and family.
" Many children play all night, and then, it is difficult for them to study at school, and live a normal life during the day. "
"We believe that this law is necessary to protect their health and the right to sleep," declared the AFP Jo Rhine, ministerial manager in charge of the draft law.
Online gambling will be available again at six in the morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precise.
The government is also asking companies to limit the time for access to these Games, when the parents of the young people they so request, added responsible.
Furthermore, is going to make available to anyone who requests it free software that allow to limit the time for connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most " connected " and the newspapers Dan news regularly on various facts linked to an intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where he faced other 58 countries.
2018-2022 world: FIFA appoints countries organizers
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the executive committee of Fifa designates the countries Thursday to the organizers of the World Cups of 2018 and 2022, a clearly political election where the struggles of lobbying influence and may come to take precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 FIFA competition will be held in Europe, traditional stronghold of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium.
The 2022 edition will be far more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia, after a debut in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its introduction in the United States or in the Far East, Japan, South Korea).
The list of public figures who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the heads of government and the Belgian Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the political and economic interests at stake in a global.
Transactions between frames, therefore, it is possible that last until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the assessment report of FIFA, candidatures Spanish-Portuguese conf.144 (2018) and American (2022) possess the best arguments that their competitors.
However, these considerations will not too much weight to the 22 members of the executive committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, the revelations that had led to the suspension by corruption of two members of the EC (Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii, could have ruined so opportunities for their country, the home of football, that only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday to spread a documentary that has confounded three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Sufficient to upset to FIFA and to embarrass the English managers, have launched an intense lobbying in recent weeks, with David Cameron at the helm.
The head of the government hopes to replicate the coup with success by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had made in 2005 for London the organizational jj.oo. 2012.
This intense activity, will it be enough to restore the shine of England before the EC?
Is not clear, since the duo Spain-Portugal has many strong points thanks to their stadiums, already smart, his experience (global of 82 jj.oo in Spain, in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its culture of football.
However, the bleak economic and financial perspectives of both countries could throw down their ambitions.
Possible retaliation against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, the only thing they achieve is give points to Russia, converted into an outsider of weight despite the gaps in their candidature (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced a " unfair competition in preparation for the vote ," in a direct allusion to accusations of the English press against members of the EC.
"are raked up his dirty cloths, trying to engage them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, who have the experience of 1994, seem the most logical favourites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seemed to take advantage to Japan and South Korea, which have developed separately an excellent project.
However, these new candidatures appear premature for two countries that have organized together the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of 2026 world to China, fervently sought by FIFA, leading to Asia stayed without possibilities for 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its draft based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue with its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be affected by the weakness of the rights of TV paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war to FIFA.
Second mandate: proof
De Gaulle really had doubted.
Mitterrand had been led to understand that doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not had even the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy still less.
A mandate in Eliseo leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
Evidence, however, that did not combine well with the mystery that is generally associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, there is always that pretend to be doubt.
To one side and the other.
In 2006, but did not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that did not rule out a third mandate.
On 15 November, in serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that it would take its decision "sometime in autumn 2011."
Therefore, the fact that the Members concerned with the UMP, Tuesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the possibility of " two mandates "has caused a stir. Some
Is it the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far less.
The president only indicated that constitutional reform 2008 restricted to two the number of terms of five years.
Simply transmitted the facts, not an announcement.
Is not the first time that talk of presidential elections with a humorous note, at meetings of this kind.
" in the worse, or better, cases still will happen seven and a half years with me ," had been treated in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: 'do not think that I am not wondering what comes next. "
Its assertions before yesterday it closer to the nomination, nor less.
Raise comments by two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the nomination in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has risen to the fore which leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to sincerarse.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident, however, is what leads to many people from the PS to reclaim organize the battle before schedule.
On the other hand, the bad polls.
For the first time, voters prefer the right-wing candidate François Fillon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46 percent, compared to 44 per cent, according to bva-l'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the topic ," has reacted cautiously immediate and the environment of the prime minister.
"If you believe that you can lose, it will not be a candidate," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"always think that can win," corrects Alain Juppé, resigned before the evidence.
Euro: the ECB was forced to keep his acquisitions of state letters
The last meeting of the Council of Governors of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be allowed to specify the methods of way out of the crisis, or at least, announce the interruption of a large number of operations extra-conventional monetary policy which should be finalized by the end of the year.
Because of the sovereign debt crisis, the European Institute of issuing Frankfurt certainly could not afford to be so compelling if you do not want to risk aggravating a situation more complicated today in the markets of European obligations.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in favour of the resolution of the debt crisis of European states.
Was unwilling to say whether he believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme of buying state obligations.
"I reserve my opinion to my fellow Europeans'....
The Eve, in Brussels, during his hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent regarding their intentions, indicating only that the programme of buying of letters of the state in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided " during the meeting on Thursday.
The one thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1 per cent, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the purchase of Treasury bonds by the ECB has doubled in the past week, reaching nearly 1,350 million euros.
Indiscretos Moreover, according to the operators in the market, yesterday would have bought again Irish and Portuguese titles.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired titles a 67,000 million euros since May 2010.
Between market operators, it is not the least doubt that you will continue the purchases (see page 29).
Economists neither foresee any significant changes of direction.
Although operations of loans to more than three months they have already disappeared from the Arsenal of the ECB, it still realises boundless allocations of liquidity to beneficial terms and with lengths that vary between one week and three months.
Economists expect today extends this device during some months.
"I cannot imagine that will significantly change his agenda."
"If not, he would face the risk of provoking more tension in the short term," said Michael Schubert, Commerzbank economist.
"It seems more likely that there is a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011," anticipates by his side Norbert bräms, economist in salt.
Oppenheim.
Regarding interventions in the market, the public debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to ensure that the market will remain stable," added Norbert bräms.
Taking into account the importance of the presentations of European banks to the markets of sovereign debts in the euro area, the Institute of issuance has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
" must compensate any price the lack of investors in the market, and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in yields paid by the most fragile states ," felt yesterday an important agent of obligations.
, because if interest rates are sky-high, states will have even more problems to reduce its debt, or even to stabilise it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi weathers the storm
After Italy has begun the week in a way that is worrying the situation improved slightly yesterday with the backflow of the types of the obligations to 10 years.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
Out of a meeting with the minister of the economy, the regional presidents have affirmed that heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation "indecipherable" and that it was hoped a weekend " unpredictable ," statements contradicted later by the concerned.186
In any event, on Tuesday, the difference with long-term rates Germans had reached a record 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of coverage against the risk of default (crq) had shot until the 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi suggested that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was superior to 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" with "turbulence in the markets," and a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third-largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland. "
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," said Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, their problem is the lack of growth and stagnant incomes linked to the same, which means that the state is at risk of not being able to meet its funding requirements.
Recent projections of Brussels have dealt a heavy blow to the government.
It is estimated that the Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget which is being considered in the Senate, based on a figure of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
In such conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will be 4.3 per cent of GDP next year, compared to 3.9 per cent by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that can apply new budgetary arrangements after the holidays, in the amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, be taken new austerity measures," believes the commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
" The foundations of the economy are in order and their accounts in good condition, as we have been saying for some time ," ensures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund, responsible for Italy in the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because in spite of his considerable debt (119.2 per cent of GDP in 2011, ndlr), stabilization efforts requested to Italy are children that required the other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is the problem of the political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi, will face a no-confidence vote in the House of Representatives, after which could anticipate the elections at the end of March.
In such a case, there would be a period little favourable to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the reinforcement of the means of combating the crisis
Christine Lagarde has already repeated yesterday during a press conference in Paris: " I believe that we have already shown on Sunday, in the evening and for the day, that the Europeans are clearly sympathetic, determined, committed to the defence of its currency and of their currency zone. "
Although the relaxation relative, recorded yesterday in types of the obligations of the European states has prompted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk of a principle of standardization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower the rating the debt of Portugal, the most frequent White today of speculation.
" Like in May, really lack clarity and transparency policies, which weighs significantly on banking systems, "opinan economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is far slower than the speed of the markets."
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers that it hides, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen mechanisms of exit from the crisis already existing.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected, and, in general, with its G20 counterparts are on track.
And that taking into account also the meetings of the Eurogroup and ECOFIN early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the colimador of markets (see above).
Turning to the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has initiated on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform investors of the Far East on the developments of the crisis in Europe.
Although the aim of the visits is not to raise money, certainly prepares the ground.
It is expected that the first broadcasts EFSF securities be made next month.
Yesterday, a representative American officer entrusted to the Reuters news agency that the United States would support a potential increase of the funds being mobilised through an additional direct commitment to the IMF.
Regarding the countries that are in the first line, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to the austerity measures with a nearer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward, by a different route from that followed Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs to request international assistance before implementing their own budgetary corrections and decide the structural reforms that they consider essential for increasing confidence durable manner.
The capitalist partners of European funds and, finally, there are the options available to speed up the process of normalization in the markets of public obligations.
Of step by Paris, 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the €750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund was not enough, the European Union will not hesitate to return to remove the portfolio.
Economists of Barclays Capital, a player in the market for the European public debt, consider that an amount of around EUR 100 billion, it would be sufficient additional, " preferably " in the form of direct injection of liquidity.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, endowed with EUR 60 billion.
A council that, undoubtedly, could examine in detail the European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continue to cause difficulties of movement, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, Twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snow and ice.
Eure, eure-et-loir Les Deux-Sèvres Vienne, and had joined the twenty departments that were already under orange alert, eighteen since Wednesday, at midday and two, Dordogne and the Gironde, joined the group for the night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow falls affect north of Gironde and Charente, although snow also slightly in island of France.
Expect some layers of snow between 2 and 5 cm, punctually of between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm or even 5 cm, in the region of Paris.
The departments affected are Charente-Maritime Charente, as well as, Côtes d 'armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne Poitou, and the regions of Lower Normandy, island of France and lemosín.
Snowfalls are strong enough to cause difficulties of movement and affect some economic activities, warning Météo France.
In the Côtes d 'armor, has forbidden access to several departamental roads to the heavy vehicles over 7.5 tons, including axes guingamp-lannion and saint-brieuc-loudéac.
As gendarmes, circulation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, therefore recommend that there be lead except in the case of need, and it has banned the movement of certain vehicles ter during the day.
During the Thursday, has banned school transport in picardía.
Had not provided any specific measure on Wednesday evening, to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture 'urges all drivers to drive with greater caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation ."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines cancelled on Thursday, 25 per cent of its flights in the Parisian airport Roissy and Orly to 10 per cent as a result of the planned snowfalls.
DGCA recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and of Edinburgh, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metre of the grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the island of France has reached its peak, llueven billions.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about 23,000 million for the metre of the grand Paris must build Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate this GSP, the state has announced an allocation of funds of EUR 4,000 million.
Conceptually, this amount will be what will enable subsequent to the SGP borrow in the markets to fund a portion of his double loop.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The Finance Act of Amendment 2010, discussed in the finance committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the planned devices to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special tax of equipment and the increase in the tax on the offices in the Isle of France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the bill, is "in the interests of the public institution Société du Grand Paris."
Moreover, is numbers: "The proceeds of this tax is of 117 million euros a year."
The second is an amendment to a tax on the offices that already exists "to modernize, to increase its output and allocating said increase Société du Grand Paris."
How much would this method?
Who knows.
The text did not give figures.
But is far 4,000 million.
"specifies that fiscal resources are in addition to the €4 billion of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the state and to be awarded to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progressed ," can read in the explanatory statement.
To the SGP was not surprised this system.
" From the moment that create revenue (the two taxes ndlr), can cover the studies for three years and then receive 4,000 million later, as we explain. "
"will be in the budget and will be used on the basis of needs ."
The SGP estimated empecerá to receive 4,000 million in 2013 for the budget of 2014.
This device, in which the 4 million pledged are not in credit, could lead to a parliamentary debate slightly lit.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Hackers revenge and spies diligent
The matter WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems scandal to the hypocrisy governing relations between states, the public and the press.
Furthermore, announced sweeping changes on an international scale and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But to go step by step.
The first aspect of Wikileaks is the confirmation of the fact that each file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation he belongs to) is composed exclusively of press clippings.
The extraordinary "" American disclosures on the sexual habits of Berlusconi so only reflect what has been written months ago in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and profile ominous ridiculizador of Khadafi time-consuming giving ideas artists of nightclub to create his sketches.
The rule whereby the secret files only should be trained by news public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If visit a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeated (on the grail, the mystery rennes-le-château, the Templar or rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This was not solely due to the fact that the authors of texts occult do not want to make fresh investigations (or not know where to seek developments on the non-existent), but because those who are devoted to occultism not just rely on what you know, which reconfirms what already had learnt.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to the secret files.
The informador is lazy, like is lazy (or has little anxiety) The head of the secret services - if not it may be, I know, editor of Libération), which only considers true what can recognize.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that sent the American Embassy in Rome at the State Department was the same that the Newsweek published the previous week.
Why then, have caused such stir the revelations of these files?
On the one hand, just say what everyone cultured already know, namely that the embassies, at least since the second world war and since the heads of states can call by telephone or take the plane to meet to dining, have lost his diplomatic function and, with the exception of some exercises limited representation, have become centres of espionage.
Any viewer who sees research films knows well, so only look that we do not know by hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact repeat publicly infringes the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker can consult any secrets more secrets of the world's most powerful country greatly affects the credibility of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both to the victims and to the " torturers ."
But into the true nature of what has happened.
In the past, in the days of Orwell, could conceive all power as a big brother who controlled each gesture of their subjects.
Prophecy of Orwell has become reality since, which can control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction, hotel visited, autopista taken, the citizen snowballed into a complete victim of the eye of the power.
But when it is shown, as is the case now, is that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the relationship of control becomes one-way street and becomes circular.
Power controls each citizen, but each citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the vengador of citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can hold a power that cannot and conserve his own secrets?
It is true, as already said Georg Simmel, that a true secret is a secret vacuum (and an empty secret can never be unveiled); it is also true that all knowledge about the nature of Mr Berlusconi or Merkel is in reality an empty secret, without secrecy, which comes from the public sphere; but reveal, as it has done, that WikiLeaks secrets secret Hillary Clinton were empty means dropping all power.
WikiLeaks it has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but, yes, and far, Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused a power so powerful?
It is evident that, in the future, states will no longer be able to put in the network any classified information, as it would be to publish it in a poster in full Street.
But it is also clear that, with modern technology, it cannot be expected to keep confidential talks by telephone.
Nothing is easier to see if and when a head of state has shifted in aircraft and has been in contact with one of the peers.
How be possible in the future to maintain private and confidential relations?
I am well aware that, at the moment, my forecast is thing of science fiction, and therefore novelesque, but I imagine to government agents commuters discreet form in proceedings with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have learnt of memory, or as much, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
This information is then retains, in a single copy, a locked drawer: In the end, the attempted espionage of Watergate had less success that WikiLeaks.
In the past I have written that the technology currently is moving as a crab, i.e. backwards.
A century after the Telegraph without cables have revolutionised Communications, the Internet has become to create a Telegraph with cables (telephone).
Videotapes (analog) had allowed researchers to study the cinema a film step by step, move forward and backwards, discovering all the secrets of the setting, whereas now the CD (digital) only allow to advance or backtrack from chapter to chapter, i.e. to huge proportions.
With high speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the plane, with movements that entails, we need three and a half hours.
It is, therefore, nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication technologies bring us back to the cars of horses.
One last comment.
Formerly, the press was trying to understand what wove in secret in embassies.
At present, there are embassies which seek confidential information to the press.
Climate: the botches of France in their funding commitments
A year after the Copenhagen agreement, it is time to look into whether we have respected the promise of funding quickly unblocked (so-called fast start or early) made by developed countries.
And have unveiled the French botches.
In the Copenhagen agreement, the developed countries undertook to provide 30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to contributing EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France 1,260 million euros (i.e. 420 million for the year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put on the table their best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to finance fast start is true: a report detailing the measures its Member States, a press conference, a great complementary event, distribution of leaflets...
The operation appreciable resulted transparency and was appreciated for what it is actually: developing countries and civil society would that all developed countries do the same, and with the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it has released 2010 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on track to meet its commitment of 7,200 million in 2012.
But, if we look at the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen agreement, the money must be "new and additional," to ensure that we conduct a complementary effort, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what it means to "new and additional."
When the European Commission proposed a harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, each chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission has taken as the reference year 2009: Is international funding and add 150 million over three years in funding fast start.
Other countries have chosen similar references in the year or at the level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that financing "all new projects" of 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous years and the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid France to developing countries can remain stable (or even lower), while claims that respects its commitment in funds "new and additional..."
Another crucial element, the share-out between grants and loans.
Once again, there is no rule, and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that every euro borrowed amounts to a euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify. The effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are unprofitable (often, projects related to emissions reduction based on most effective technology) is fallacious submit a euro that is going to recover as equivalent to a euro Dona... as much, only for their commitments should be counting the cost of the loan to the country that grants the loan (that is to say, the equivalent to a rate of interest).
But France is not useful such reasoning: "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros making 91.5% of loans (389.90 million euros) and a 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the document of the EU to see it with your own eyes.
Is the only EU country that uses so often the loan.
Germany uses it by 46 per cent, while Denmark, Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, are respecting their commitments with 100% grants.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union brings a euro to meet its commitment, France only brings ten cents and considers the effort is comparable.
Let a good trick!
In short, in its financing fast start, France conducted a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the action at the time, and on the other hand, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, manages to give the impression that spends 420 million "new and additional," as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it appears that it is Bercy who has occupied of arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States to continue donating when they can simply pay?) and in the negotiations, the developing countries are not stupid...
Chapter of the precocious finance is peanuts, relatively short-term, in relation to the whole of the negotiations on the climate.
But it could be a bit more in the vast machinery is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that it is not.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of precocious finances.
Firstly, France could announce a change in the method of calculation for years 2011 and 2012, with the intention to respect their commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But especially France might make advanced discussions on wagers at stake in relation to the long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently under discussion): We do not get rid of the issue of the " additional character " nor the method to compute loans.
France could change its stance to become so progressive in relation to this issue, as it is with others.
We therefore hope the new environment minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will be coming to Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on the fast start of France and on its vision of "additional character " and the use of loans would help to improve the standard of international confidence necessary for progress in negotiations.
Warning on pesticides eaten by children
A 10-year-old boy eats in a day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association générations futures (the former Movement for Rights and the respect of the future generations).
The association, which cautions that its results "are a significant statistical value in view of the limited number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problematic treated," purchased in supermarkets of Oise and Paris between July and September, the food tends to consume a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack each day.
These meals taken as a model, that respect the official recommendations (five portions of fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day), as well as sweets, were examined in laboratories searching for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
Stock of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as carcinogenic possible or probable and five substances classified as carcinogenic insurance, as well as 37 susceptible substances act as endocrine disruptors (EP), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"But in almost all of the cases, they do not exceed the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually, our survey shows clearly that the exposure of consumers to contaminants possibly carcinogenic and / or EP is troubling," said the association.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain alone, more than a dozen possible carcinogenic waste and three considered as carcinogenic insurance, as well as nearly a score of waste that can disrupt the hormonal system.
The Apple, imported from Brazil, scheduled as snack for the college, contains trace amounts of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including in the food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
Furthermore, fillet Russian, the canned tuna and even the loaf of bread or gum were prepared with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and cyclohexene.
At the dinner, the slice of salmon was more "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat food in the microwaves was not entirely clean.
The final risk that generate these "cocktails of contaminants" for the consumer, "it probably is," says the study.
The alliance Europe ecología-les Verts (ee-lv), for its part, has proposed " given the gravity of the situation "to implement a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stem" the rise in diseases linked to civilisation ."
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of pesticides 365 different identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of whom 76 in cereals.
