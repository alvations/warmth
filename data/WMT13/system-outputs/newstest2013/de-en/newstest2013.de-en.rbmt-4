A republican strategy, in order to oppose the re-election of Obama
The managers of the republicans justify their politics with the necessity to oppose the choice fraud.
However, the Brennan Center holds latter for a myth when confirms that the choice fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of the people killed from the flash of lightning.
The lawyers of the republicans recorded only 300 cases of choice fraud after all the way in 10 years in the USA.
One is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.
In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.
Unlike Canada the US Federal states are responsible for the realization of the choices in the single states.
In this sense the majority of the American governments since 2009 announced new laws which complicate the procedure for the registration or the urn walk.
This phenomenon gained importance after the choices of November 2010, at which 675 new republican representatives in 26 states could be recorded.
Due to that 180 drafts alone in the year 2011 were introduced which restrict the practice of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new choice laws require that the voters present a photograph identity card and a proof of the US citizenship.
In addition also the periods are reduced through these laws for the early voice delivery, declared the right to register on the choice day as voters for invalid, and arranged citizens for whom there is a court file the right to vote.
Before the choices of 2006 no US state demanded from the voters to show a photograph identity card.
Indiana was the first Federal state to raise such a demand.
The Uppermost court of justice of the United States confirmed the constitution moderateness of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice onto other states.
In the course of the last two years they supported in 34 Federal states drafts with which the voters are forced to show a photograph identity card.
It is to be said importantly that the US citizens do not have a universal ID card as the health insurance card unlike Quebec.
In fact 11% of the US citizens, that is 21 million elective persons do not have any photograph identity card exhibited by a government authority of their state.
In addition five million new voters do not have in the year 2012 such an identity card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are to be paid frequent in order to receive the necessary identity card.
From the new restrictions young people, minorities and people are disproportionately strongly affected with low income.
In fact 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35.000, 18% of the citizens do not have the necessary photograph identity card over 65 years and 20% of the voters between 18 and 29 years.
This suffices still further.
It is not allowed in several states to the students that are regarded as voters that give their voice increased for democratic candidates to use their photograph identity card exhibited by their equipment.
On the other hand the same states allow members of fishing rod or hunt associations which choose more strongly for the republican page to use the cards made out by these associations for choices.
Before 2004 no Federal state demanded a proof of the citizenship for the dialing.
Arizona was the first Federal state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011 a dozen of states have passed laws which require of the voters that they prove their US citizenship.
These measures are aimed clearly at restricting the hispanischen voices.
Because it is obvious, that two of three hispanischen voters that prefer democratic party.
In addition republican legislators supported in 2011 in eight Federal states laws with which the registration was abolished by voters on choice day.
In addition you restricted the right to achieve those voters support from individuals and groups that would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns helped for the voter registration with the case of the general elections in 2004 to register approx. 10 million citizens.
Because through those for 2009 adopted measures the part of the registration was reduced from new voters by 17% in 2010 in comparison with 2006.
In addition the republican legislators passed in five more Federal states laws which are aimed at reducing the period for the early voice delivery.
For example 33% of the voters who chose in advance, Afro-Amerikaner, were with the case of the general elections 2008 in Florida although they form only 13% of the voters of the Federal state.
Same one is valid for the hispanische population.
Latter formed only 11% of the voters, however 24% of the citizens that chose in advance.
In contrast formed the white, that represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of the voters, that chose in advance.
Of course the democratic legislators and their supporters opposed vigorously to the discharge of laws that restricts the registration of the voters.
Several drafts were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The general attorney of the USA intervened in order to misfire the most controversial laws.
You could restrict the damages in part.
For example only 16 of the 34 Federal states passed laws which require the showing of a photograph identity card.
However, the again introduced rules will complicate in the year 2012 the practice of the right to vote beyond doubt.
The democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see the influencing of the results as a clear objective in them in the states decisive for 2012.
A report of the Brennan Centers by 2011 shows that the states that passed these laws form in 171 of the 270 voices that are necessary in the choice man committee in order to gain the premiership.
It is too early in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the right rules will have considerable effects on the result of the premiership choices at the choice system in the year 2012.
However one is secure: these new regulations will affect the poll negatively.
In this sense these measures untergraben in part the democratic system of the USA.
Prostate gland cancer early recognition: the test should be done or not?
The PSA test shows in fact sometimes faulty results, with wrong negative or, however, also wrong positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to stronger hesitation of the already irresolute men for the realization from early recognition tests.
The test should be done or not?
We obtained the opinion from two specialists.
With the case of the studies carried out in the USA numerous disturbances existed between the control groups so that it is difficult to interpret these data and to give unequivocal recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came for the conclusion, that a difference with the case of the mortality of patients with and without early recognition exists.
This study also showed, that at a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years the probability of the education of metastases about 30 to 40% higher is, if no early recognition was carried out.
Therefore I recommend the test from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years if one has a direct relative who already had fallen with prostate gland cancer ill.
With men of afro-American origin also a higher risk exists.
The most important thing is to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer illness was recognized.
There are cancer kinds, that aggressive and others that are indolent.
The extent of the risk of his cancer illness must be made really understandable to the patient when the possible options with the case of which Prostatakrebse can remain untreated are shown him if it does not influence the living quality in the long term, and one rather decides for an active supervision of the illness in these cases.
Today no treatment occurs with many men with whom one recognized cancer since their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent any threat for their life.
One suggests an active supervision to them and offers them a treatment in the case of advance of the illness.
One determines the criteria for a decision with increasing accuracy, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend the realization of the test in spite of that.
It, however, is most important to speak with his doctor in order to determine whether it should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember developed an instrument with which it is possible that before- and to evaluate disadvantages of the PSA test.

Bend forward the illness
Unfortunately there is not any miracle means for the prevention of cancer.
In spite of the progress in the research the assumption of a healthy way of life remains the best way in order to reduce the risk at it fall ill.
It is reckoned that 30% of the cancer illnesses could be prevented if they all ate well and moved sufficiently.
"If there were not any smokers anymore, this value would go up at least onto 50%", stresses André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, people go out from that that about 10% of the cancer illnesses through inheritance are caused.
Several remain also completely unclear.
For the Canadian cancer society the fight remains a priority against the tobacco dependence, in spite of the drop of the number of the smokers.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a factor of risk for several other cancer kinds.
It damages the health of the people strongly.
"Today still there are in Quebec 1.5 Mio. of smokers, the speaker André Beaulieu feels sorry.
Encouraging data: 10 years according to the renunciation of the cigarette, the risk is reduced at cancer to die around half.
The weight
According to the Canadian cancer society predominance and Adipositas support also the outbreak of the illness.
You seem the risk for Breast-, Transverse Colon-, Rectum-, to increase gullet, pancreas and womb cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity protects against transverse colon cancer during the entire life" he adds.
The feeding
The organization also recommends to restrict the consumption of red meat.
In too great amount it increases the risk, to fall with a wrath and/or rectum cancer ill.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preserving of meat through smoke-curing, drying or salt can lead to the education from carcinogens.
"The body cells can damage Letztere and lead it to the development from cancer", it declares.
Vitamins
In the last years several scientists examined the connection between vitamin additions and cancer.
Your investigations are currently not, however, conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer society the studies to vitamin E are inconsistent.
While a study was finding out the decrease of the risk from prostate gland cancer, another rather showed a rise.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was not shown clearly also yet.
In addition Mr Beaulieu shows how it is importantly to talk about his objections and his familiar preloading with his doctor.
"The realization of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson aroused in the last summer a certain sensation, and this for good reason.
One believes in fact, that this boson at nothing less than participated in the mechanism is that is responsible for the measures of all objects in the universe.
And finally it is a question of the last corpuscle whose existence was observed from the standard model - our best or "least wrong" declaration of the nature and the behavior of the matter - predictedly, but empirically not yet.
But for the physicists it is not completely secure that it is really a question of the Higgs yet.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new corpuscle, and that it resembles the Higgs-boson predicted from the standard model strongly.
In addition this seems to be confirmed by new data which were presented in this week on a great physics-congress in Kyoto, but data are missing still in order to be completely secure about that.
We assume in spite of that deceiving oneself it being a question of the Higgs in fact since apparently only a small risk exists, and we have a look at what it is a question of.
There is in this world an unavoidably unavoidable law which causes that two objects cannot be available simultaneously at the same place.
It is not possible to offend against this rule - and you do not attempt it too strongly since you will hurt.
Because even if the corpuscle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that also such a law applies to them: the Pauli'sche exclusion principle that says that two corpuscles cannot fill the same room at the same time, when they are in the same "quantum state", at which this "state" on the whole consists of some of their properties.
Of that going out the physicists split up the corpuscles in two categories one.
The good citizens who are called Fermione and in a well-behaved way obey to the Pauli exclusion principle are in a corner.
And in the other one those ones move bosons, a bad gang of anarchists to whom nothing is holy - in any case not this principle, what means that they can be in the action at the same time at the same place.
These bosons divide according to himself the web page The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboren (that is after all the way completely amazing) in two groups on: the Mesonen, which we will not handle here and the "strength corpuscles", through which the great strengths of the nature spread and with those ones the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be accentuated here, however, that these bosons not all so exotic creatures are, as one could mean.
If you are in the situation to read this chronicle then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "photon" which the "messenger" of the electro-magnetic strength is.
If indeed a corpuscle with an electrical load speeds up or changes the direction, the electro-magnetic field "is faulty" exactly at this place, in about instance as a pebble that was flung into a pond.
An electro-magnetic wave (Light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation and so forth) arises through this "trouble", and this wave is not anything else than a photon and thus one thing that one bosons "Carrier of the strength".
More stable field
Same is valid for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must "be interrupted" so that this shows itself boson.
However, the Higgs-field is very much more stable than the electro-magnetic field is; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a little bit comparable with a pond been cold whose surface could be zerfurcht only from a very big rock.
Therefore a gigantic particle accelerator as the CERN is necessary - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - in order to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electro-magnetic field is once again helpful in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are not in fact all corpuscles and not all materials that interact with the electro-magnetic field.
Some, as magnets, do this, however other not - for example a leaf would never by itself keep paper to the refrigerator.
And equally do not interact all corpuscles with the Higgs field: those ones who do it own a mass while the others are not owning (as after all the way the photon) any measures.
For what can all these investigations be now "good", asks Ms Plamondon?
They serve the inspection of the standard model (SM) for the science, and they also make for the physicists possible, all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the to examine SM exactly.
There are after all the way numerous physicists who hope most ardently for such deviations being found since the least difference could open a door for a "new physics" and darn some holes of the model.
One must say that latter still shows great shortcomings there it no declaration for the force of gravity (ups!) and the dark matter offers that forms approx. 80% of the matter of the universe (once again ups!).
However, such deviations were not found at the CERN until now.
Effects
The effects of these investigations for the general population are to be predicted in a more difficult way, but it would be to be accepted wrongly that there were not any.
After all the way: in the early sixties the engineers of the laser did not presume that their works would activate such a revolution in the barking-labs.
You saw scientific applications, however nothing else wider.
In fact the late physicist Willard Boyle - that worked in the Bell Labs in whom the laser was invented in the 1960th years, and developed that one the first continuous wave laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 even - said already to us that the laser at the beginning was rather regarded as a "lab game".
Introduce yourself...
In addition applications can result also from all the instruments which surround the research.
For example Willard Boyle developed in turn a small light sensor in 1969 during his works in the optics.
Although it was not the initial purpose, this sensor is used today as "an eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and brought in the Nobel prize for him in 2009 for physics.
Of course this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change our life unavoidably, but it means that one can never really know it...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With their committee for "Dying in dignity" Quebec discussed recently the tricky question of the life end.
The debate must be resumed shortly although a draft is prepared.
However, it remains in this important subject area to do still a lot.
Le Devoir attempted to consider this nearer.
A few weeks ago Mr L. only still lived in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate gland cancer that ate it up had let him a period of time of two years.
"You gave me to live five years, I created seven years", he said half-heartedly, in his bed in the home for palliative care of Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil lying, in which it had arrived on day before.
"However, it is always a three-score, on that one cannot be prepared", he says.
The illness does their work: an immense weakness hinders him at going only onto the toilet and even eating himself.
At the table in front of a delicious lunch sitting, he agrees resignedly to making be helped during the food.
Courageously he even succeeds in smiling and speaking with the foreigners who are around busy around it, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of the usual death.
"It is my greatest wish that one cures my diarrhea since this is humbling" he informs.
The team found a remedy some hours later for this evil.
"In the course of our life we find out that a man pees in the stand", tells Pierre Brodeur, psychologist, in the home Victor-Gadbois.
To return to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That hangs from the ability of the person", to accept a regress, he finds.
Because in the view of several persons who work in the palliative care great events occur among these regresses.
The patients who are introduced to the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois stand all of them at cancer.
You have a maximum durability of three months.
In this stage they "do not cure" more from the doctors and nurses that see to them with so-called Maintains covers.
For Ms A., 89 years, the worst apprehension is, "conscious and through suffocation" die.
But through the illness I became acquainted with my children really.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I do not have any wishes anymore in the living", she says before her accepting that one puts her on a mask which helps her during the buckling.
She expects another last visit of their Sohns which comes from Italy in the next days in spite of that.
In the home Victor-Gadbois one offers with a group of volunteers care of the body and support during the absorption of nutrients at.
The palliative care is used, when there are not any other possibilities anymore.
In order to arrange the death more pleasantly.
In Quebec a bed comes to 11,700 inhabitants for the palliative care.
That is very little if one considers that we will die one day all of them.
Here the life is continued under best possible conditions, declares Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both on level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One gives a mouth care with brandies or Pepsi the moribund according to wish.
The diabetics do not have to control their blood sugar mirror anymore.
And the death is part of the everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served a beer to Mr X who died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink up the beer to feet of the deceased.
"We help members and patients equally", tells care directress Nathalie Savard.
No day as the other one is in the home Victor-Gadbois.
Next to an old man of 93 years that enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is supported well from his pillows while one is drinking a toast for his honors a young man of 36 years that is surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two small children, in tragic way, dies after he attempted everything in order to survive.
"For six months three to five beds are always busy with cancer patients in the age of less than 45 years", Dr. Christiane Martel splits up worried with.
53% of the patients introduced to the home Victor-Gadbois come from their dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of the access to the palliative care
That is one says with regard to a care that is supposed to ease the suffering of patients that 77% of the Canadians do not have any access to the palliative care when latter the final stage of their life have reached, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, as the home Victor-Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care in the Montreal greater area specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in the health supply Quebecs worries for several doctors of the discharge of a law for the regulation of dying-help and assisted suicide with objections specialized in the palliative care expecting.
Since the month of October a manifesto in the circulation is that was signed by prominent personalities of the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe in order to show their contradiction to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel the health system Quebecs is not efficient enough in order to guarantee that all right have to proceed onto a qualitatively high-quality palliative care with the dying-help before one accepts.
Recently, she says, I a patient that was 14 days with great pains in the emergency admission saw without one taking measures for their relief.
I fear that only therefore the patients want to die because they do not receive any adequate health supply.
And simultaneously several oncologists treat their patients doggedly in spite of worst predictions up to the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it aborted a cumbersome chemotherapy.
When I informed my oncologist that I will abort the treatment, she answered to me, she told that she regrets that I give up the fight.
However, she had said to me that I am at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients that asked for dying thank the nursing staff that it did not allow this wish after their pains were eased by a team of the palliative care.
It must be said, however, clearly that the palliative care is not omnipotent during the pain treatment.
To Elsie Monereau, 8% of the patients do not speak to head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Montreal greater area about a pain treatment.
Completely at the end of the life the doctors access to the terminal Sedierung that comes to that thus frequently the patient either sporadic or durable to at the moment of his death make sleepy.
We cannot do longer as if we do not perceive this page of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have increasingly more frequently the possibility to access to this terminal Sedierung.
They all say the same sentence to patients whose pains are not eased: "I want to die."
But that does not mean unavoidably, "I want you to make me sleepy", but "I would like, that my pains are eased".
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Immovable scandals of great extent in Quebec
Officials of the road authority, enterprises of the construction head trade, Geldbeschaffer of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell every day what they know about a splendid "system" in which building industry trade, officials, politician, trade unionist and mafioso are knitted.
An "industry" which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, in particular in the 1990th and 2000th years.
"It is strange as the system falls apart since one took drastic measures" Jacques Duchesneau, representative in Quebec and former conductor of the police of Montreal, jokes.
The scandal was uncovered by it due to an investigation of the embezzlements in connection with the contracts to road construction works in Quebec coming in which the former prime minister had agreed to only unwillingly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010", emphatically it, "the traffic ministry" would have "saved" a billion dollars "alone "at the contracts", because some zügelten in this case their instinct in order to receive their part!
The Charbonneau-commission brought already two mayors to case, he adds to show the tactics in the hope that she succeeds in it behind the individuals.
One 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit
The 2011 started up, permanent anticorruption unit undertakes also great efforts with their troops at auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.
In addition the policemen of the "Marteau troop" that has caused since 2009 that the "canalization cartel" goes ahead from Montreal during the artificial inflation of the contracts more cautiously...
In the last weeks she carried out serial house searches and raised accusations against local mandate carriers as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is a mayor of a suburb, because of fraud and corruption.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which resigned just from his office as mayors from Laval, the third-biggest city of Quebecs.
He is suspected, repeats in the exchange for public tasks bribes have received.
Expressly engineers of the road authority were accused after all the way by Montreal, as well as entrepreneur of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Latter one aroused sensation when it explained the mode of operation of the "system" to the commission for the receipt of public tasks.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts preserved in Montreal to a mediator being connected to the Mafia that transferred the money to the Montreal union several years long the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito had in the 2000th years his hand everywhere in the game, when it more than 88,000 Canadian dollar (approx. 68,000 euros) at province parties gave, particularly onto the liberals then been at the power.
He also confessed, to have organized an illegal mid procurement for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Canalization contracts whose costs were blown up by it artificially
In Montreal the "system" of the corruption functioned smoothly.
The former civil engineer engineer Gilles Surprenant described this fully detail before the commission: in ten years he received from the building contractor presents, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes at the level of 736,000 dollars as a return service for canalization contracts whose costs it blew up artificially.
Other officials of the road authority admitted that they could be lubricated in their blowing up the bills with wrong addition services artificially around 30-40%.
In addition an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he overlooked on purpose a shadow budget that filled his cash boxes with black money.
Due to these disclosures Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which flung Montreal into a hard crisis.
Chantal blind was one of the first representative of Montreal to beat alarm.
As a mayoress of the municipal district district district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolted from 2010 against the sale of a municipality plot, that for 5 million dollars was acquired and for 1.6 million builders in the boomenden property market were resold.
70% of black money in the choice campaigns
From the investigation that finally is carried out she says, that they "at a thread that it makes possible to understand the mode of operation of the system unterwanderten by ants in order to stop the evil and to denounce the guilty parties pulls".
She says that the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are at cleaning the wound, would need, however, an investigation unit specific only for Montreal, as well as a supervision, in order to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How one cleans.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau says for his part its part, about Officials stealing several hundreds of millions of dollars is, particularly concerned, however, about the role the "Mandate carriers that are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not complex into the fraud!
Departing from a part of 70% of black money during the financing of the choice campaigns in Quebec he jokes: "It was said to me that this is only a weak poor copy of the reality."
The government Quebecs suggests to restrict the donations to parties to 100 dollars which would not change anything at the situation according to it: "As long as the election campaign editions are not restricted severely, black money will be in the politics in the circulation."
He recommends a complete reworking of the system for the allocation of public tasks and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall more deeply; when we go the things with courage onto the reason, we can reconstruct the house on a sounder basis with more controls and laws."
If this history damages the international renown of Quebecs and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau asks those ones who laugh at that to fling a look into their own back yard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona"!
In this season you accepted a new extent with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can declare it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of the PSG.
Splendid players came.
I make progress daily at their page.
The technical personnel gave me also a lot.
These elements encourage me daily to correcting my game level.
And with the case of a game this is even simpler.
In the soccer everything goes very quickly.
But I do not burst out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preliminary training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my playing time with Saint-Etienne I have done always step-by-step progress.
You do thus the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti zunutze...
The new records of this summer are accustomed at delivering games of very high level.
You also know that every training unit is decisive.
This provides, that a player must offer as I, the forehead and wants to give his best.
After all the way Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot with respect to my game position.
He is supported by co-coaches as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Natural.
Ancelotti instills respect into all technicians.
In the Ligue 1 there is not currently any comparable person, and it numbers among the best coaches of Europe.
He looks back upon a rich experience and won many titles with associations looked at.
He had contact with tall players.
I think that he will win further titles in Paris.
In January I held an encouraging conversation with it.
Then I had recovered just from an injury series.
The confidence which he put in me is also a declaration for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyons took the place of the top rider from us.
We lurk, however, in the ambush.
One of our most important objectives is the champions League: we qualified in this manner for the round of 16.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will attempt to come so far as possibly.
From now on everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak our word against very good European teams.
First of all we want to become First of our group for postage so that we can deliver the Rückspiel of the round of 16 as a home match.
Can the PSG in the short term become a large European association?
He has already the budget for that...
In order to become a large European association, Paris must win titles and make a name to itself on a long-term basis.
This is not today the case.
Financially the PSG gives himself the means so that this intention accepts concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 as this was the case in the last season?
This would be natural a great disappointment.
This year creaming off this title really suits to us at the heart.
In the last season we were thick at that.
In May we were disappointed since we were strong enough in order to suffer the victory.
We ended the season with a very strong achievement.
We closed with 79 points.
Usually one should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, achieved an even better season.
I believe that this year the correct one is.
Even if the large teams as Marseille, Lyons or Bordeaux struggle for the title, I believe that we have the stuff in order to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
In Anbetracht of that, what was invested and the players that we have it is normal that a lot by us is expected.
We accept the complete.
If we, however, win at a home match against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something which one can reproach us for, that with security is a little frustrating.
One wonders what the people still expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We attempt to make a game draft.
A team builds itself up with the time.
In the champions we proved League to strength.
You consider Manchester town, an association the since two seasons does not create to qualify for the round of 16 and has made the also gigantic editions!
With regard to the invested sums one believed projection of you for the game pause with 15 points!
That would be called, that our opponents and the French championship except for care would be let.
Lyons and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, became "geboostet" from this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is thrilling.
I hope for our being the smiling winner in the month of May and saying ourselves that finally we won it in spite of all difficulties.
The PSG completely seems to be dependent from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better, that one speaks of a "Zlatan dependence".
That is, that Ibrahimovic is efficient and fires many gates.
Therefore it came and it proves that he the star is the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he played, it made clear, that it a splendid player is and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He respects also the persons who surround it.
What it achieved is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to correcting their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is to one of the best defenders worldwide, also facilitates it all other to do progress.
How did you experience the EM 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
Participating in this EM suited to me at the heart.
Unfortunately my injury hindered me at knocking out some playing time.
I saw there things which I followed from fortified.
Today I succeed in realizing good games in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the "blue's" my hope.
From what happened in Ukraine we drew our lesson, and today we must put an exemplary behavior on the day.
Which opinion have you to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "blue's"?
It achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.
How it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to do any comparison.
Blanc had reached his objective when it had qualified us for the EM.
I hope, that Didier Deschamps will lead the "blue's" to Brazil.
Does the draw forced on the 16th October in Spain (1:1) represent a prelude game?
This game gave us to confidence.
Everyone supported all others.
Before this concurrence in Spain I have never yet experienced a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin paying and selling without bank is possible
Transactions and service charges between the participants involved identified, the opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks.
In addition a political vision is as so often tangible in these technologies: the conviction, that the monetary system current, arranged from bank monopolies, to financial crises leads.
In fact the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (however in dollar, euro and so forth convertible) as also some protocols for the secure exchange as BitTorrent that facilitates the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network already about 200,000 transactions were understood.
Some a thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as a donation or as means of payment.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell onto 2 dollars before his recovering today on about ten dollars (the courses are performed on the web page bitcoincharts.com) five months later.
Nothing especially Impressive in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or finance products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) showed interest in that in a report published in October about virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in the competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes from other kinds of virtual currencies as that one "of Credits" that are used in order to get on in a video game that win one through playing or buy (and also exchange back sometimes) can.
The social network Facebook developed also such a system.
However, the trade is controlled each time by a central authority and dealt.
With Bitcoin all key switching centers nodes switching centers are simultaneously keepers of the account book, testers, money-emitters as well as buyers and sales assistants.
How does this network function?
Every transaction between two users occurs in reality between two e-mail-addresses in the form of an E-Mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for every payment what guarantees the anonymity.
A series of the data being related with this transaction is initialed electronic through a double encoding system.
The network can check the authenticity of the transaction for this manner.
With the aid of the contents of the file is to guarantee it also possibly that the sold Bitcoins are available in the account book of the public accounts spread in the entire network.
The decisive step consists in entering this new transaction into this book.
This happens about a mathematical task which is started on the computers at which the winner who is a kind of provisional central banker has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a question of a breaking up of the file, that is the transformation of a big file into a shorter and unequivocal electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it, before the whole "is chopped up".
It is the objective to find the number which makes a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other knots can check easily whether it is the correct one.
The transaction is linked with the chain of all other transactions thus permanently, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user for the deceiving wants to pay two times very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other one stays without linking since both different fingerprints have.
The computer which solved the task receives 50 Bitcoins.
For the prevention of an inflation this reward is halved regularly, probable before end 2012.
The Bitcoins contained in the circulation are thus restricted, but divisible up to a a hundred millionth on 21 million, which lets a certain elbow room...
In addition the difficulty of the task with every improvement of the computer power power is increased.
The life of the network had already heights and depths.
The web pages that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin insertions.
"The used weak point does not affect the actual protocols", assures Pierre Noizat, who just introduced Paymium that is an enterprise for the payment with real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also about the possibilities of the money laundry with the aid of this anonymous service.
However cash points also this shortcomings on.
Important protagonists as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others as the blog-platform WordPress.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron analyzed from the Weizmann institute in Israel the account book and shown that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in the circulation.
In November a "Mega-Schlussverkauf" was started.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmquist, which works for the enterprise Coinabul that converts Bitcoins into gold, pleases itself.
Pierre Noizat, who is also an author of a book about this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or to a payment without contact with a mobile telephone, uses, however, Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions which are cheaper through that.
In addition the holder administers his identity and can remain thus anonymous.
The system can be implemented with the traders easily, and latter ones must install no new terminals or computer programs.
You must declare only an address simple, that of a telephone "photographed and recognized" can become, Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users, serves.
A general trend in the case of which hierarchical systems are reconsidered for the benefit of more strongly horizontally achieved systems is to be noted.
"Some time will regret until Bitcoin continues, but in 2013 a turning point point could be", it predicts.
The EZB plans in their report after all the way, the different ones, risks today regarded as high in the case of a success of this currency revalue.
We withdrew from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the USA might follow at the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army takes the possession of their territory again and that the Afghan population decides their future, to expect of us without any.
We punished in particular the Afghan farmers in our regarding her as terrorists.
And us even with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured person and disabled person.
The Taliban consist from foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, however, frequently also of farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as at this time the Soviets.
You want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions even if Dschihadisten, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have followed them.
Latter ones will not be, supported by the local insurgents, tolerated, sometimes, anymore there if the western countries become more discrete.
The withdrawal of the French troops of the foothold in Nijrab which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees which was financed with the aid of French credits occurred properly.
The truck and tank convoys flown by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
From end 2014 there will not be any influx anymore of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance of 1994 to 1996 the conditions have changed themselves.
Then Kabul was empty and the country due to the fights of the different rebellious groups of the war cladded.
Your power takeover was regarded then as a kind of liberation and return to the security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al-Qaida, but their situation did not improve until today.
Former Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban held the common wish the women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Soviet war came in 2001 onto the power again.
You changed into profiteers when they confiscated plots of the government around them as building land land onto refugees from Iran and Pakistan sell and so benefit from the massive American allocation of suborders pulled.
You brought yourself into disrepute, and most of them were not shared even at the fights.
As I heard it in the campaigns, the people want a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, so as those ones, that the American allowances too Nutze could do: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people have the war and his ideologies fully.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan they had contact to the modern world, and their advantages enjoyed.
About 65% of the population is less than 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities the state schools are full of girls as boys.
One will have to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return either for the obscurantism of the former parties or for the corruption of certain managers.
All, also the armed parties, are had by mobile telephones; the television with his Turkish series which represent a modern world is looked at everywhere.
An army is now available.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will stand regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight already make an effort for the restoration of the militias in the province that will escape from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited by a certain decentralization at the example of the western nations, but through abolition of the office of the Prime Minister that existed since the constitution of 1964 the USA wanted to make from it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want any foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of the choices planned for April 2014.
However, his country is since the fifties and already long dependent on foreign help before.
Industries were not reconstructed, operative jam works are not available and important irrigation system's were repaired not.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetable nothing is produced.
The private initiative the priority is let.
In a country which was directed from 30 years of war as a basis a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan would have immense mineral resources was spread.
This reinforces still the impression that the western countries were only on site in order to take hold of that.
Without energy, in order to work the iron or copper ore on site, and/or. without means of transportation for an export about the mountains no mining industry is possible.
The Chinese already almost left the copper mine from Mes Aynak, make the international archeologists make (financed by the World Bank) their excavations on the gigantic Buddhist place and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will be also necessary, that Afghanistan and Pakistan, of which extensive the One- and are exports dependent, restore normal relationships.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was finished on 20th November.
The new cooperation contract plans the continuation of traditional aids: Girl and boy grammar schools, institute for French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical one and agricultural field, support of the archeological delegation.
Since 2009 a service of "civilian clothes military actions" of the ministry for defense (Cimic) that was stopped in 2012 in dozens has carried out numerous non-profit works and measures for the renovation of the agriculture from mountain villages and carry on from a small French nongovernment organization make in order to attempt that "To gain hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of the compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These works for which numerous local workers were necessary had been able to help to suppress the revolt: Irrigation, well, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, ground protection and rise of the agricultural useful areas.
Which souvenir do we leave behind after military editions of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions that is very hard in these valleys often lying in a height of more than 2000 meters.
In the message dozens of written inquiries of small agricultural intentions came in from municipalities of the province Kapisa.
So that the farmers free from the revolt led by foreign groups, which is their wish according to their own statements, the continuation would be smaller, well more controlled and they civilian aids'' affecting directly for their advantages necessary.
A constitution with the crowbar in Egypt
It is a question of a new poker of president Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is keeping on being ever divided up more then with respect to the constitution declaration which gives him the unrestricted proxy in a temporary way, he decided on putting everything on a card.
For the surprise of all he announced on Wednesday that the constitution-giving meeting will adopt his final composure on the next day.
Just a week ago the head of state had lasted to this plenum two additional months for the end of his works.
Egypt counts now in almost two years on a provisional, repeatedly changed text, what weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal jumble.
This new initiative guaranteed only for an even stronger split of the country.
For his opponents the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" when it keeps on breaking his word and "infringes upon the right".
On pages of his proponents one assures that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possibly and to speed up the temporary process.
Within 14 days a referendum should be kept off.
A very short period which forces the brothers to renouncing their intention to explain the Egyptians the text section for Abschnitt.
For the president also a kind and manner is it to regain his public and democratic legitimacy during which protest rages in the whole country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time it seems to be convinced by that to Mohammed Mursi that the Egyptians will make benevolent.
Especially as an ultimatum is put to the Egyptian nation with this going back on a rash vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unrestricted proxy", latter according to assumption of the constitution supposed an end should take.
85 most mainly Islamic members of this constitution-giving meeting adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not follow the request.
In a word before the constitution declaration in the middle of November it has turned away since they think that they were not in the situation to make their viewpoints noticeable.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the civil society acted equally.
11 persons, deputy members, were added to the reaching of the quorum yesterday morning in a rush.
Some suit the Muslim brothers very near.
It is not surprising that the articles mostly one-consistently were adopted.
The commentators found it after all the way entertaining, that the only difference of opinion of the day has come... in the time for the prayer to the expression, since some members of the committee thought that the pendulum clock of the constitution-giving meeting did not go exactly.
The text that yesterday evening still was adopted consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 that drew all attention onto itself, remains finally identical with that of the constitution of 1971 and it says that the basic principles of the sharia are the main sources of the right.
The salafistischen parties for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand had the hope to replace "the basic principles" by "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamisten the fact that this article was not changed is a proof of their good will and of their respect towards the other members of the Egyptian society.
The liberals who regard this only as a propaganda stroke reply "hypocrisy".
Because according to them the Islamization of the constitution occurs via other articles.
In this case they have especially article which awards a discussing function to the university Al-Azhar in 220 in mind, in particular with respect to the inspection of the conformity with the laws of the sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier this is being, there "the persons that are called for a comment, were not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.
One can "see" the first signs of a theocracy in that".
The apprehensions of the liberals are been nourishing in addition from the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less moderate than the present one.
"Currently no concrete religious engagement is to be recognized.
With this constitution we stay within the framework of the middle class state.
Most lawyers that worked on this text, none are Ulema, but academics that were trained partially in the French system" Alexis Blouet appeases, who writes a thesis about the Egyptian constitution transition.
He adds, however, "that" "there can be an ambiguity with respect to the article in 220 since the used concepts are borrowed to the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Anm. d. Talk.].
And in future the question to what extent civil judges are competent could be raised to decide on that."
Next to his religious aspect the yesterday adopted text is criticized strongly due to the comprehensive authorities which it gives to the president to the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue, that these compared with the former regime clearly are reduced.
A further quarrel point: the authorities of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military the examination of the defense budget is not presented to the parliament, but a national defense council.
Just the same there will not be any prohibition of civil procedures in military courts as the unions to the defense of the human rights demanded it.
Latter inform also of their apprehensions with respect to the text, that they when freedom-threatening look.
The facts of the blasphemy are maintained, and insults are now forbidden, which could have fatal consequences for the right to free opinion comment, in particular for the press.
In addition no article anymore refers to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of the torture through articles 36.
This word was not contained in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president yesterday evening on televison was having to be expressed, demonstrations for this afternoon planned are.
The proponents of the head of state will march up Saturday.
In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Praised Country unites the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and an unchanged nature in itself.
AIF tells you the five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.
Before the holy places bow
Go to the Jordan river in which Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who swim in this river receive God's blessing.
Galiläa is the place at which Jesus achieved his miracles: the transformation of water in wine on a wedding, the walking on the water, the Stillung of the lake storm and the fishing.
Now here Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
Most sanctuaries are found, however, in Jerusalem.
Believers inspect the ordeal and/or cross way of Jesu Christi here (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins near the roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on the mountain Golgotha, where the crucifixion place, the anointing stone and the grave Jesu are.
Here the navel of the world which symbolizes the rescue of the mankind is according to Christian opinion.
The Cloister of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place at which according to a Christian legend the tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion Jesu.
Also the holiest place of the Jews is in Jerusalem - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple, that of the Romans in the year of 70 nth Chr. was destroyed.
Tradition-Appropriately people of different belief directions leave behind there notes with wishes which then come true.
Making a journey into the height
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remains of the secret cache in front of enemies, the Herodes the Large in the year of 25 nth Chr. uplift for his family made.
They are due to a cliff in the mountains in 450 meters height above sea-level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins from own strength.
An air cable railway brings all others to this historical peak.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski field Hermon into which it pulls innumerable tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you reach there with a shuttle bus.
The ski runs have an overall length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend pagan gods lived supposedly on the mountain top.
Going to unique museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Only at a journey all of them cannot be visited.
A visit should be paid nevertheless at least the five most interesting of them.
Under that the Israel-museum is once close to the Knesset (Parliament).
There old Qumranhandschriften or scrolls of the Dead Sea that were found in rock caves in the Judäischen Wüste are kept as well as about 500 a Thousand archeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also the museum of Art in Tel Aviv is a visit worth.
There the collection of works of the impressionists and expressionist Monet, Pissaro, is exhibited renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can go to the museum in the bath Al Basha which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bathing-servants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
Over there there are not either museum guides or souvenir shops.
The entry is free, and donations are refused fundamentally.
The fifth museum, that is the holocaust-museum and/or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells about one of the erschütterndsten chapters of the history.
The most ergreifendste department is the monument for the children which was built for the memory onto the 1.5 million children which were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
There is complete darkness during the entrance of the room.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died ring out.
Also Ukraine is mentioned there.
Doing something for the health
The three most important recreation areas of Israel lie near the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphin arias and oceanariums.
Strange to say swims in the Red sea also in the winter months since the water temperature does not fall to less than 21 °C there and warms up the air to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even still more warmly and there baths over the whole year.
After all the way this unusual sea with a situation of 417 meters below sea-level is the most deeply sited sea of the world.
His turquoise blue water has a high salinity and supports even nonswimmers without problems through that on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here from dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and nerves strapazierter for the smoothing, for treatments under application of salt water (natural salt brine) and welfare sludge as well as for the treatment.
Touching the secrets of the antiquity
The old town of Tel Aviv, that is the city of Jaffa, contains these secrets at the Mediterranean Sea coast.
Through this city the famous lake way disappeared which united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia with each other.
The city is mentioned in old-Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions Noah just built his ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda with which it led a long and happy life at this place.
Tourists amble gladly through the narrow lanes which are named after asterisks.
Fortune is supposed to be according to the legend lovely to all who touch the walls in the lane with their asterisk.
In Jaffa you can find newly-married pairs from whole Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of king Herodes, you can roam through the roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In the roman time Caesarea was the most important city of Judäas and residence of the roman governors, under that also Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theater evening concerts and operas are performed nowadays.
Noticing-list for tourists
If you go to Israel, you do not work yourself any worries because of your bad English knowledge: About 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
One takes along the money in the journey more gladly in no euros, but in dollars, which can simply be changed in shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you get on mostly with the bus, however, in Jerusalem there are also some expressway railways and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations that the lower city connects with the upper city.
Strictly speaking it is an underground funicular railway.
A journey within the city costs independently 6 shekels from the means of transportation, that reaches including changes for a journey from up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition the sabbath is inspected in Israel on Saturdays.
Of Friday evening up to the sunset on Saturday markets and businesses are locked, and the public traffic rests.
And at the Sunday morning the week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher food is served, what pork, sea products, fish without scales and food, that both Milk- than, to contain also meat products excludes.
Instead of this you have the choice between different courts with mutton and cattle meat, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus-paste, different sauces, deep-fried Bällchen from mashed beans and peas (Falafel) as well as fruits and vegetable.
In the streets of Israeli cities there are not any stray dogs.
For that there are many welfare-nourished cats which cosily and in an undisturbed way roam through the streets.
In the evening one sees it even sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like animated places and do not say refusal of titbits.
A car hire costs according to brand between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs besides addition 15 dollars per day.
And Fahrradverleih costs 15 shekels per day.
Admission tickets for museums cost on average 30 shekels.
In numbers
In the year 2012 more than three million tourists visited from all world Israel.
Most adventurers and to recovery-searching came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
Of January until October 2012 came 118.8 a Thousand Ukrainian tourists into the Praised Country, what corresponds to a rise of 51% opposite the comparable time span in the year 2010, before the cancellation of the visa duty on 9th February 2011.
"The large and powerful one" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While representatives and Bürgerrechtler are discussing about which benefit the law brings about obligatory language tests for migrants, criminals sell already forged certificates
Annually 13 million foreign workers to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
It is your only objective to earn money for the maintenance of the families remained in the home.
On 1st December a law according to which every work migrant must put aside a test which certifies knowledge of the Russian language came into force.
Up to now this regulation is valid only for migrants who want to work in the service industry, in the local housing association and in the retail trade.
However, the tests with the time are supposed to become the duty in the future according to Federal Migration Authority for all foreign workers.
In this case one must put aside not only language tests, but also tests into the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
Language knowledge must be proved both for the receipt as also the prolongation of the work permit.
Exceptions are valid only for citizens of countries in whom Russian is official language.
Persons who received their training reports and diplomas in front of the decay of the USSR in the year 1991 are excluded also from this law.
Sense, problems natures and protection of the rights
The entirety of the examination places becomes under the aegis of the Pushkin institute for the Russian Language, the Russian university of the nation friendship, the Muscovites State university, the Sankt Petersburger State university and other Russian colleges'' stand.
The migrants can put aside the tests in all cities; already now already more than 160 corresponding centers were opened in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the representatives of the Staatsduma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Bürgerrechtler on the other hand introduced question following the coming into effect of the law in the press repeatedly: What brings the whole actually?
Which changes does it bring the regulation to have to show language knowledge both for the Russians and for the foreign workers?
Particularly, speakers reply to the migration authority, it goes around, to reduce the number the mandatory worker.
"A lot talk now about the protection of the rights of work migrants", the conductor of the representation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew, says.
Your rights must already be protected, however, against their departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Onto problems migrants without profession, education, language knowledge and medical appraisal push.
It is convinced by that to Sebelew that a future migrant without language knowledge will meet people unavoidably with bad intentions that put it into a dark, narrow hut under the pretense of help where it wait with dozens seinesgleichen months without Essen and documents and will slave 12 to 14 hours on day.
Many complaints of our migrants reach us.
"In the home one is promised to you, and with the case of the arrival you are deceived, you get their passports taken off and you do not receive the promised wage", confirms the conductor of the head office for work migration of the Tajikistani migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not chide, head!
Nevertheless many citizens of the Central Asian republics that want to earn their money in Russia add, that they not only not be able to master the language of the target country, but also their own language not show hardly in writing.
That is not natural so very much their fault, as rather the evil: Only few Turkmenen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford also only a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not yet even money in order to feed the children not to mention, to buy decent clothing, shoes and school things for them.
As teenagers these children seize then the first occasion for the money-earning immediately.
"It is difficult without language knowledge", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Bürgerrechtler accentuate concerning the law following important aspect.
Only migrants with legal status must put aside the test.
If you do not have this status, there are not so any examination and subsequently any official work.
Meanwhile the majority of the foreign workers keeps on staying illegally in Russia.
"Cordially welcome" or "Admission for unauthorized forbade"
Many migrants confirm that it is not simple to receive an official status in Russia.
Bureaucratic hurdles and of course the linguistic difficulties are the reason.
In addition the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
A forged registration can one fast and only for one and a half thousand do.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are most mainly forged and not registered we, and cases of blackmail arise from that then.
"You want one- or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow is expressed opposite journalists".
"Not only shun from any costs for wrong papers"
Already on the day at which the law came into force it turned out that only the registration documents of the migrants cannot be forged.
Some forged certificates that certify the completion of the language test were fitting-taken already from employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The forged papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Of course the new owners did not receive these for nothing: Every migrant who hoped for being able to spare himself the tests so paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
That is more than twice so much as the costs for the official test are: This costs a work migrant three thousand roubles.
Over the most important immediate task consisting in protecting the system against corruption so that the certifications can simply not be bought both office-bearers and Bürgerrechtler agree agreed to themselves.
For the moment the authorities can only promise foreign workers who fall through the test with the case of the first time that they receive time for a language basic course.
In addition places in fields in which no active communication with people is necessary are offered newcomers without language knowledge.
Ministry of the Interior Office ignores illegal arm market
Part of legal arms at crimes extremely small
The Russian Ministry of the Interior Office plans a sharpening of the arm law for private arm owners.
In this way the authorities react to the recent events: Injured persons with the case of gunfights on weddings as well as seven dead during the amok race of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police want to forbid the carrying of non-fatal-deadly arms in public and raise the age for the possession of firearms of 18 onto 21 years.
The chairperson of the Duma-committee supported the proposal for security and corruption abatement, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes to the arm law shortly are presented to the Duma.
Not they are all satisfied with the Russian authorities wanting to oppose the problems through "Attraction of the screws".
In the Internet an open letter was published, that authors - representative of different arm associations - demand from the authorities, to refrain from "senseless sharpenings".
The percent of the crimes with registered arms is very small, the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC, expressed.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior Office 142 crimes with application of the registered arms were committed during six months in 2012 while for the same period in total 1.168 thousand offenses were being noted.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a sharpening of the law will not keep for private arm owners criminals from serving oneself on the black market.
At the time of one can find according to the authors in Moscow every possible arm for little money.
Meanwhile the Ministry of the Interior Office stresses that the circulation of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: of the factories up to the officers
The arms reach over several channels on the black market.
There are such forward channels channels to five tells former colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active ten years in the education ministry and in the general staff.

The first channel is the army and/or the military, that is arms that were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The arms were stolen both by the Russian officers as also the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal arms come which are stolen from order guardians by criminals.
Baranez explains that arms which both from the armories of the police and directly were stolen by employees of the prosecution authorities number among that.
Further illegally sold arms come from military arm warehouses.
Near many military camps it resulted frequently in explosions.
"There are proofs that it was a question of arson in some cases in order to hush up the absence of arms", says the former military member.
Also the arm manufacturers achieve a contribution to the black market according to Baranez.
"Nowadays there are innumerable private armament factories, not stand firm that of the international competition and therefore the arms secretly on the black market, about instance in Moscow, squander", the expert tells.
A further channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles come from poor countries as Kyrgyzstan.
"Over there there are an own, sometimes handicraft production as well as a Mafia which organizes the smuggling, explains the former military member.
From where do the arms come?
Experts calculated, which part each of the five channels has at the supply of the black market of illegal arms approximately.
In the year 2011 a report by the center was written for problem analyses and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior Office and the Federal service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the topic arms.
The predominant part of the illegal arms comes according to the observers from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Is half of all arms on the black market there through the "fault of persons responsible in charge, who have to do in their work with arms reaches", it is called in the report.
According to the data of the researchers 17% of the arms come from conflict fields, 14% go back to thefts during the arm production, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sale consultant of an arm shop which does not want to be named in particular assures that nobody already long buys arms which are found in the case of illegal excavations anymore since they went out of date.
According to it it is more frequent that traders get themselves the supplies in an arm warehouse.
About an officer cadet an arm, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought.
The arm is switched off and handed over through the fence.
"The trader brings the arm into the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines", he tells
"The police know answer of course above all and carry out therefore periodically control purchases with traders which illegal arms offer if she cannot keep to the plan for the exposure of crimes" adds the sale consultant.
"As in the luxury loading"
Buyers and sales assistants think of the most frequent about acquaintances to each other.
I had had a look at web pages and blogs, than somebody onto me became attentive and to me suggested to the station to come "To Begowaja, where a person would wait for me, that would bring me onto a certain place" where we could discuss the price then.
I found out the price for the arm first there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get an arm, I need an acquaintance who has contacts", tells the sale consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I do not trust in it".
There are traders on the markets, nevertheless there one must go and arrange to see with a code as "of Iwan Iwanowitsch, who can orientate, that the daughter lost a tooth".
I come currently even onto some brass knuckles about an acquaintance who I trust in.
It also provides me with the brass knuckles only therefore because he knows that I it not verpfeife.
Newcomers search for arms on different ways.
The former military member Viktor Baranez tried in the middle of the 1990th as buyers of illegal arms when he wrote an article on this topic.
The pattern's's have changed according to it not.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt myself as in the luxury loading", the military member remembers.
The buyer does not get the cat according to Baranez in the bag, but he can try out everything.
I than potential customer does only simply not buy, but he goes with the sales assistant into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can fire then there, and if I am convinced by that, that the arm has a good shot, we negotiate "with each other", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search result to web pages and groups in "Vkontakte" where arms are offered "for different purposes".
Neither any papers are not needed still there are personal meetings.
"You need only the suitable sum money", it is said in the advertisement on the web page "Buy combat pistol or rifle".
There users give up your orders and inquiries set.
Are also minors sold to?
"Natural without license", user "Iwan" (literal quotation) asks.
"A TT buys. Moscow", the laconic inquiry of "Fedorenkow" says.
The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.
The people come as hungry fish with the case of the feeding and arrive then in Siberia and may shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I heard about following pattern: The web page is registered usually abroad, and Russian laws do not find any application.
The persons responsible in charge accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money above a bank automat.
"He receives as an answer a photo and a description of the cache of the arm", tells the press agent of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that one can go out also emptily to the end, when one places an inquiry on a web page, and come behind gratings.
The Federal Security Service switched recently innumerable appearance web pages, and buyer, that arms want to gain, go to the service zuhauf into the net.
"The people come as hungry fish with the case of the feeding and arrive then in the sibirischen labor camp and may shovel coal", he says.
A Makarow for 100 United States dollars
During the purchase of illegal firearms prices of 100 to 900 United States dollars are to be reckoned according to experts.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" one can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
One must wait up to one months.
The arm is distributed in military arm warehouses by minders of middle rank.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior Office the number of the offenses with illegal arms decreased about 7% in whole Russia in the period of January until October 2011 on 22.9 thousand while the number of the uncovered cases of theft and blackmail in connection with arms, ammunition, explosives agents and explosive devices around 7.8% was shrinking.
In the USA fasting-Food and supermarket employees strike
Every fourth US American young person is sometime behind the cash box of Mc Donald's
In the last days it came everywhere in the USA to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fasting-Food-chains as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Nor nobody can predict whether the protests will swell still further or whether they already soon run out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
Next to the rise of the modest wages of simple Walm kind- and the organizers of the protests pursue fasting-Food employees the aim of founding trade unions.
Up to now this branch of the economy is not organized in a hardly union-related way.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday at which in the USA clearance sales that attracted millions of customers occurred, which now and then led to brawls.
On this day some Walmart-Mitarbeiter from which there is worldwide 2.2 million laid down their work and branches of the chain whose target group persons of low and middle income are picketed together with trade unions and left activists.
Walmart sells all products, of baby's napkins about hunting guns and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart-Filialen is on average between 8 and 27% more favorable than in big supermarkets.
Therefore many of the insignificantly paid Walmart-Beschäftigten shop only at the own job.
The prices and the array of goods turned Walmart into one of the greatest enterprises in the USA.
According to critics Walmart can often sell the product so favorably only therefore because the employees are paid badly.
Latter ones complain also about difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests at the "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance over the contribution having increased from 30 for the factory-owned health insurance on 100 dollars in the month.
A typical Walmart-Mitarbeiter who earns 9.5 United States dollars the hour cannot afford this rise, they said.
Proving more brashly from the Californian university in Berkeley that it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars if the enterprise increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour.
Those ones are approx. 1.1% more than they donate for wage now.
If Walmart would completely put down the wage increases onto the customers, every purchase cost her only 46 cents more in the future.
Per annum those ones would be for them in comparison with today additional expenditures only of 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart state in a satisfied way that it resulted in protests only into nine Federal states and these did not give any losses to the enterprise.
The Black Friday lasted the next day in his cases of 8 o'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total the Walmart-Kassen carried out almost 100 million transactions at the "Black Friday".
The speaker of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the web page of the left-wing Huffington mail office, that "less than in total five" Walmart-Mitarbeiter laid down the work and the protest action was only "a further" PR trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Free cash box"!
The protests went on this week into New York, where their objective, however, not Walmart-Filialen (that does not want in this advanced city and that therefore are up to now inexistent), but McDonald 'it and other economical restaurants were.
McDonald 'it say, the enterprise sells billions of portions, and in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York town council councillor
Currently the minimum wage is according to federal and New York legislation near 7.25 dollars the hour.
In Fast-Food-Restaurants the minimum wage little by little is raised, not gotten, however, too strongly, and on average their simple employees in New York 8.90 United States dollars of the hour.
Less than they nobody deserves in this expensive city.
How it is possible to manage with so little money in New York is inscrutable to me.
There was once a time, in that one almost a quarter of all US American young people to the school with McDonald stood'it behind the bar, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
Hardly one saw the main source of income in that or intended to remain longer there.
Now meet me in the case of interviews with employees of McDonald 'it constant people that complain about their having to manage with this wage and feed even their children sometimes.
On the other hand there is Street journal in the forum of the newspaper rampart a comment that Verfasser says it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know as one is supposed to feed her.
The participants of the protests, that "began" on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock in the morning before the McDonald 'it in the 40th Street and in the Madison avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of Fast-Food-Restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 United States dollars of the hour which corresponds to more than one doubling of the present minimum wage.
You kept on demanding the education from trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch.
The US American law forbids it the management to suit this objective in the way and to admonish union members off or to release.
On the other hand the management does simply not do it to them.
The foundation of trade unions in the fasting-Food-branch is, however, difficult also for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personnel fluctuation.
Dissatisfied ones
There were loud protests on this day also in front of many other Fast-Food-Restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at the noon in front of the McDonald 'it at the Times Square with which some local democrats spoke under that town council councillor member of Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' it say, it sells billions of portions, and "in spite of that one does not give you any sick person days, and you are not paid for your honest work"!
The demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New York democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio that said that "we should support the fasting-Food employees common so that they receive a just wage and can achieve the economical prosperity that every New Yorker earns"!.
According to New York Times this was the greatest action of their kind in the history of the US American fasting-Food-industry.
However, only some a Hundred people from whom all in which in New York tens of thousands work are not busy by far in the fasting-Food-branch were on site.
Nor it is not to be foreseen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain is made outwit up to now only moderately"
The topic of the broadened reality popular with supporters of modern technologies is perceived in last time for usual by the lens of some specific glasses.
First Google presented a functioning model in the summer during his annual conference, in November it became known then that also Microsoft had applied for a corresponding patent.
In the conversation with the conductor of the group for interactive three dimensional technologies in the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes, however, clear that the glasses were only a passage station for the scientists of the enterprise.
It provokes the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Describe please shortly which investigations your group practices.
- We occupy ourselves with the communication of Mensch and machine, want to enlarge in this case the borders of this communication, however.
Up to now the mankind got stuck most mainly in the phase in which with pixels on flat screens is worked that sometimes is also affected.
We, however, want to look 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this communication.
For example the Xbox-console and the Kinect-sensors are a progress, and nowadays no Xbox anymore without Kinect is sold since they all are interested in movement control.
- What expects us still in the future?
- Although Kinect brought the communication onto a physical level, many things still happen on the flat screen, sometimes in three dimensional.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition up to now not yet decisive.
We attempt to change that, work on real tridimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under that projections.
We must discharge the computer world in our physical world and make it more definable.
For this purpose it, however, is necessary that not only the user, but also his surroundings is recognized.
Then we could much more simply complement the real world with virtual objects.
And most first of all we should become these goofy Virtual-Reality-helmets loosely!
- What do you think about voice activity detection?
It is popular, however she does not become overrated?
- It is surely not the space purpose solution since it raises questions to the privacy because one would not like to inform always all bystanders of his actions and intentions.
Actually every kind of communication with computers is good, however, everyone in their certain niche.
For example we worked in the field of the control of objects on public places at a project, at which we statt with short and brief, with projecting gestures experimented.
In this case the gestures were recorded not by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
Still it is relatively large, could be reduced theoretically, however, onto the size of a wristwatch.
However, in total the future belongs, however, to mixed control types, for example gestures and language.
- As that?
- We would ask me for giving you this soda water can you for example?
You say it and point simultaneously at that.
- Usually I only simply say it.
- Oh, that would be very heavy to recognize.
- That is called, you want the user to adapt to that what can perform a machine to the respective time and what not?
- Not absolutely, however it is a question here of a mutual approximation.
I think, that we work must in the next time of sensor types new particularly at the development, that make it possible to capture reactions of persons in a more exact way.
Those ones can be for example laser sensors since they offer a good solution in the depth, which is very important.
- Which claims do you put onto modern cameras departing from your work with the Xbox Kinect-sensors?
It mangles onto solution, depth or still something other?
- The present generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of the tridimensional recognition.
8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be natural bad.
Not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth are nevertheless the main thing.
All current technologies are not so seen for us well enough, there the developers of the algorithms more work have.
It must not only the solution along the X- and the Y-, but be considered also along the Z-axis.
Also the speed and the number of the pictures per second are important.
The movements of the human being are extremely dynamic and the present 30 fps are openly said, in particular for gestures to little.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay in our lab in talking-moon between 1 to 100 milliseconds at which the present commercial sensors seem likely at the second value (60 to 100).
Not they all understand how that influences the communication of Mensch and machine very much.
I needed an appliance for my work just the same, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Would the number of the cameras not have to be increased?
- Kinect works at the present time with three "cameras", at what one of them is actually an infrared sender and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual RGB-camera.
It is not used for the calculation of the object depth.
More cameras could solve the problem possibly...
Or intensifying the problem since more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect-similar system with the case of which we could play with different tiltings in order to find out how that helps us during the tridimensional determination of a position would be beautiful.
- If I remember right, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public unlike Google.
Do you not think that with regard to the application of the technology of the broadened reality in the everyday life the glasses have the best prospects?
- It is not natural pleasant always to hold a smartphone on the way in the raised hand, however, I think following: The most fabulous variant would be a "changing" broadened reality with the case of which we could change over over a Cloud from the glasses on the smartphone,
The glasses are a personal gadget and in that their strength (Only you can see private) lies, however simultaneously also their weakness, because a broadened reality by means of glasses prevents that you can work on virtual objects together with others.
- We long imagine a moment, that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air not only Tony Stark of irone One, but accessible also to standard measure mortals is.
There is a problem which critics of this idea refer to frequently: There is not any noticeable reaction!
The hands sense nothing at all!
Which answers does your group want to give onto this objection?
- In my lectures I speak often of the broadened reality representing the seventh breakthrough during the communication between Mensch and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could absolutely become the integration of the taktilen perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an a little unusual projection pad.
It perceives pressure excellently!
It, however, something solid gives the "pictures in the air" also technologies that in fact are achieved on that to lend, for example produced the interference of some done ultrasonic rays in a certain point, where the finger is, a feeling that currently, however, is still so weak as if somebody would blow over the balls of the thumb.
There are also bands for the wrist which influence the nerve extensions in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- You attempted, the brain outwit?
Think it make, that it senses what should sense it if it just sees something?
- That is a good idea, so we did not attempt it yet.
Here a further task which we will still long have to fight with, that is a human being that is in a locked room physically of making believe hides itself, it is instead of this in an open, practically infinite room; here we work on drafts with race bands (other than in fitness studios), movable platforms as well as big balls.
Up to now the brain makes itself be outwitted only moderately, and before us still many work-rich years lie.
Just that does the work on the field of the virtual reality for a researcher so rising: With the case of many topics we stand first at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "inhabitant of St. Petersburg Avantgarde" that is dedicated to city-dwellers that form the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the exquisite list already hochrangige representatives of the inhabitant of St. Petersburg art scene arrived, their successes about the borders of the city out go and that often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the one dressed in reds bearded, that one finds once near the Russian Museum, once near the summer garden, once at scene meetings or on Vernissagen.
Where always the pictures are also made out by Kirill Miller, big crowds lure her.
Kirill Miller is to one of the typical inhabitants of St. Petersburg social-philosophical artist, that create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a radiant personality of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the eighties and/or at the beginning of the nineties.
He is also a man of the city and conjures his fellow citizens a smile into the face through his presence on the street and guarantees with them for good mood.
Recently he grabbed himself a barrel organ and became the inhabitant of St. Petersburg Drehorgelspieler since he felt ready at last for this difficult role with regard to his artist existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why you are actually always in reds and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city on the way?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between Künstler, image consultant and Gesellschaft.
In the society all which differs from the grey norm a little causes aggressions and bad behavior.
I want to engage with the people in conversation, however, through my provocations.
Each of my last provocations was an invitation to the conversation.
- When did you know that you must become painter?
- At an exhibition in the culture palace Newskij near which my works were exhibited.
I understood, that I must go this way.
Then ging the time of the free old ones, painter, however, officially not acknowledged then too end, and new and free painters as I were unintelligible.
I made friends with the painters of the new generation, therefore with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; "Puschkinskaja 10" arose from that, and then end was first once.
It pulls me to the theater, for the fashion, for the music, actually to all, except for the literature.
- And all the united one in your kind clinic... - it was important to me to stand in the center of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creating artists should meet.
In the year 1995 I filled a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, and over there there was up to the renovation works a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the inhabitants of St. Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember as cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" came there.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for the playback track, narrow tricots supported and also the today announced composer Igor Wdowin belonged to them.
When the group started playing live "Leningrad" became from it.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career began it, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the kind-clinic.
There our employees and regular customers went.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000 there was in the press an inquiry in the case of which it was a question of the distinction "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the year", and in this way I had arrived at the climax.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a human being of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present time it is simple to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same one: One can be famous without achieving a cultural contribution in this way.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the current affairs and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the topic "The Russian museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Formerly I was social, but now it hurts and prepares fear, to be like this.
In a clown that all smudges and his tragedy loses.
I love the grotesque tale, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let's save for example the world in our dictating that everyone has to dress himself up complete.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothing and itself in an oriented way at the outside appearance and not at the interior of the human being.
However, maybe one must not give a human being the hand, but should spit to him into the face.
The delusion disappears by the dressing up.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A culture city should have such a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
Formerly the people formed great groups: The bohemians loved the one and the simple nation the other thing.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult them all to like.
I am not a a hundred-dollar-note which everyone likes.
Now you must consider who will like you.
Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.
- Several thousands come to the appearances of Stas Michailow, however!
- Left women come to it, there the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons 300 persons come and not 10 thousand, subsequently there is less management, money, and everything is ruined.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive her and not to destroy the reached thing.
In my youth I painted such pictures which hanged even in a row with the works with a collector from Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures which usually come first at the end of the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: intellectual culture and consumption culture.
At all no culture has consumption, that is something very else.
I am a human being of the last culture and grew up with artists that lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture which I approve.
- Kirill, what Petersburg lacks?
- Good culture experts.
One says: Servant of the culture.
However, not everyone of them can deal with culture.
With the real czars it was different, because maybe the czars did not understand a lot from culture, understood, however, it that correct experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are at the present time good consultants.
In Peter castle we have the experts which could be, but the way is barred to them since one needs more hochrangigerer experts that evaluate the Ersteren correctly and clear them the way.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same one is valid for the Erarta, however with the difference that they say honestly, that they do not pick up all contemporary art and other museums must search some painters therefore.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow there are much more culture and a corresponding fertile soil.
On our stones art can grow up only heavily.
We need a cultural fertile soil, because have for example we in the meantime more writers than readers, and nevertheless that is not correct.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us those ones are little a lot.
Art must be again modern, so as at the beginning the former century's.
The project is financed to the city of St. Petersburg from subsidies
Birth in the cosmos
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board work themselves onto the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save the mankind, the important question how we can propagate in the weightlessness or on the replacement planet surrenders?
There are not many choices in my opinion.
De facto there are only two real planets which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.
"Indeed Mars and Venus", the scientific employee of the Astronomical Sternberg-Instituts Wladimir Surdin says.
There is a temperature of 500 degrees, while, however, the conditions are being comparably life-friendly on the Mars, on the surface of the Venus.
Life would be only in big height or in the orbit of the Venus, therefore in the space, possible.
The researchers handled the question of the propagation in the space first of all with regard to the flora.
Already half a century in front of that experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of the peas cultivated in the orbit did in the least not distinguish from the earthly kinds.
It the growing followed from insects, more exact of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In the year 1979 Wachteleier were sent to the cosmos in order to investigate how the weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A very normal chicken develops.
However, then the problem begins.
"The problem consists in the chicken having to find Halt; it must be able to stand on his legs and start moving", explains the lab conductor of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Wladimir Sychew.
Without fixed subsoil the chickens somersaulted wildly.
Ten hours later the instincts of the newborns were completely dulled.
The chickens did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later they simply died then.
"Twice we made chickens slip and stopped the whole then because it is simply impossible to work there with them" observes Wladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chickens in the space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring 2013 the experiments are continued.
However, there will be only homosexual species on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats, which already inseminates into the space were sent.
In principle nothing special was arrested in this case.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but only a single experiment was renewed it, and the investigations must be continued", notices Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing the space rats got junior staff.
One could not solve the problems natures of the propagation directly in the space up to now.
The task is difficult.
Animals which are torn from their natural living space can simply not follow their propagation urge.
Unlike animals can the human being that fundamental.
The homo sapiens is capable to abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Nevertheless be flying to women already for 50 years into the space.
There was the greatest risk at Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing to have the mankind is the feminine organism.
Our seagull flew from that, and nobody on the earth could have answered following question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Finally nobody answered this question", says space travel veteran Wachtang to Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only a year after their space flight, the first feminine cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also a cosmonaut.
In the year 1988 the second woman gave birth to a son in the space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who twice was in the orbit and performed even works outside of the spacecraft.
In spite of that a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts with whom after long flights everything went well and they got healthy junior staff.
"Per more, it is the more dangerous even in the case of flights to the orbit", cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation, concludes.
And nevertheless the mankind must search for new ways in the biotechnology, the radiation protection and the producing of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a compulsory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a suspense state the cosmonauts gain routine for the work in the open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water as pleasant, it is some foreign surroundings; however, babies feel water as a natural element.
It is, as the Ichtyander small ones would lay down report of that that the life at the country the ocean entstieg.
It gives a connection between the fact that there is a child about 9 months in the stomach of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that that it can become accustomed to water more easily then.
Basically that is logical since from the birth up to the first swimming 2 weeks just go by once.
"That is too little time in order to forget something", says baby swimming-teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While therefore for a newborn child the weightlessness is being a much more natural state, the woman does not manage without force of gravity.
In a state of the weightlessness the stomach and basin musculature forms itself enormously quickly back and it takes away also the ability in this way to squeeze out the child.
Na good, we avoid that through geburtseinleitende aids.
The birth could occur for example also in a special chamber in order to squeeze out the child.
"Aber what happens then"? the question of Waleri Poljakow not insignificant says.
On the other hand the child needs also artificial force of gravity.
Without feeling the earth attraction, the organism cannot shape the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in the orbit into a load suit as an adult for the training.
It will lack what is for his life of elementary importance simple.
"This experiment that we carry out together, that is the birth of a child in some foreign surroundings, will provide, that we will bring a disabled person," a completely unangepassten human being to the world", the conductor says ahead of the bioethics commission of the institute for medical-biological problems AT THAT, Igor Pestow.
Up to now the birth of children is bare theory in the cosmos.
Sometime she becomes, however, reality if the earthlings open to a far planet in their spaceships that that home for their descendants born in the space becomes.
NKÚ-leader: Control of the black-system fails on account of the politics
Czechia has good surveillance entities and appropriate laws in connection with public tasks, lapses, however, into their application.
In the conversation for Aktuálně.cz the vice-president of the Highest control office (Nejvyssí kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, says this.
"A law is never complete, but it must be used correct - and this is my opinion's with us not the case, Kala comments on the current situation".
Apparently for a similar result also a common control comes through Czech and German testers.
As a negative practice example he mentions the attitude of prime minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called "black-system".
Recently the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - the system is therefore now forbidden or allowed?
"A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity", states Kala.
On the meeting of the control committee of the chamber of deputies you talked about a common Czech-German project in whose frames the laws of both countries were compared with each other concerning public tasks.
What was it a question of there actually?
It is a question in this case of a parallel examination which we about two years ago began with.
Simplifies saidly, it is a question of the European legislative determining how public tasks are to be handled. The single state legislations base themselves on that. And finally there is still the actual practical application.
We compared this all with each other, and although the examination is not yet finished, we could find extremely interesting differences. Maybe even still, generally saidly, the laws are "more severe and more perfect" a little with us, the actual application, however, is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is confirmed with its not sufficing to make again and again new and more exact rules. One must deal also with the actual application of the right.
To what extent can the project be a help to you? What results for you from this project?
Just such common control could contribute to our stopping calling us in for a Perfektionierung of the laws and the lowering and Austarierung of threshold values constantly if this does not affect obviously especially positively.
Economic efficiency management means to gain a thing for a reasonable price (what always the lowest price is not) and to exclude illegal enrichment or really criminal actions.
But the lowering of threshold values for tasks does not guarantee that we also reach this objective.
Maybe it is even like this that we load the system only with excessive "paper junk" in this way, and those ones that search gaps in the system considerably more simply have it to exploit the system than if the threshold values remained higher.
You talk about the problems during the practical conversion of the Czech allocation law.
How does the control system system function in Germany?
There is here a similar authority as our NKÚ, or does the system function differently?
What affects the authorities, so the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office that is similarly built up as with us and is in charge also of a college that only something is formed differently. Fundamentally both authorities work, however, similarly.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain measure, at what Germany, however, is a Federal state, that is that there are these courts of auditors also in the single federal states - the German system distinguishes in that from ours.
What corresponds to our state means may control only federal means to the BRH.
Public means which are administered by the districts and municipalities with us are subjected there to the control of the country courts of auditors.
What affects the German legislation is that one simpler than ours?
Generally I would compare this without concrete information only reluctantly. Nevertheless Germany in a way some ways is called often model with the case of which one can say that Germany is better in everything, however, not designated.
Is that due maybe to there the testers being better?
That does not determine, however as said: I do not like such comparisons especially gladly.
To that it is still to be said that also the countries which are a model for us have to fight also with problems.
Otherwise they would not have yes anything of a cooperation with our authority, not true?
What affects the Czech legislation, which importance had the amendment of the allocation law for your authority, you already sense any effects?
In view of that, that this novelette is first short time in force, does not affect it with the case of our examinations up to now yet.
Since our controls subsequently occur, one must reckon a certain delay here.
We verspüren effects up to now rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - so have introduced we the new control instrument "Recognition of risks of the Unwirtschaftlichkeit and checked with this almost 14,000 public tasks and analyzed -" here the changes will affect as a matter of course since the threshold values are changed that conditions for certain kinds were modified by announcements among other things.
See the discharge of this law rather positive, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law in a certain way is a step into the correct direction and hopes that this assumption is confirmed.
The problem that the rules become "more severe" and cannot be kept anymore can occur, however.
Already under the previous rules the persons subjected to an examination are opposite the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of the regional policy, the regional council) in such a way accountable, that every noncompliance of the allocation law of an injury of the budget discipline amounts.
Is it then reasonable, however, to make the law even more severe?
My opinion's not in this way.
The system must exclude those ones that attack and want to misuse, and do not punish the system.
Only the bureaucracy puts such a system under even bigger pressure.
Where is the way out here?
We say at first once, which way is not objective-leading.
The prime minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what that is called exactly?
Is the black-system now forbidden or allowed?
A law must have nevertheless his validity, and if something is by law prohibited, nevertheless the government chairperson can simply not come then, and hinder the control office whose duty now is the control of the compliance of the law in his activity.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", however he cannot say that we do so than if nothing was.
The allocation law contains relatively severe rules of processes specific about the formal carrying out - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand it is, however, also tragic if the bidder with the best offer alone due to irregularities is excluded.
The law will never be complete, but it must be used correct - and that is that what with us of my opinion is missing.
There is ice smoothness on the streets occasionally, mainly they are, however, dry.
On the streets of Czechia partial snow and ice smoothness exists.
Mainly the streets are, however, well passable, sometimes increased caution is offered.
Karlsbad
In the Karlsbad district the streets this morning were well passable, there was snow and ice smoothness separated.
The temperatures sank onto -5 to -10 °C, during the day it is supposed to become a little warmer.
In the region it does not snow now anymore, and in the deeper altitudes only a thin snow coverage stays.
On the combs of the Ore Mountains about 30 cm of snow lie, however.
There was restricted view according to information of the district street guard because of fog.
The expressway R6 and the traffic routes of the first street class in the region are currently without limit passable.
Attention is offered, however, for example on bridges on which the roads are sometimes frozen and smooth.
All traffic routes are passable likewise to the second and third street class, including the mountain streets.
On these streets step-by-step frozen or driven snow residues remain, however.
In particular in the higher situations attention increased from there is offered.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of east Bohemia danger exists because of ice smoothness, in higher situations and in the mountains a driven snow shift lies on the streets sometimes still, the street and motorway management office informs on their internet pages.
The Straßenmeistereien warn drivers against ice smoothness which can occur in particular in higher situations in the district Pardubice.
It can result in ice smoothness in particular on traffic routes of the second and third street class in the circles Lanskroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The streets I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are handled chemically.
Snow lies in particular on the streets in the giant mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A driven snow shift lies in altitudes on the streets of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In east Bohemia it is today mainly sunny or cheerful, and it remains to a large extent fallout-free.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, a weak wind blows.
Bezirk Pilsen
The streets in the district Pilsen are today well passable, however, increased attention is local demanded, and the operating parameters are to be adapted to the weather.
This is at the morning frosty, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the freezing point.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can result on the streets in ice smoothness.
Locally fog is in addition to be reckoned near which the view, however, will improve in the day course.
These information come from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The motorway D5 is practically without limit passable, the Straßenmeistereien recommend increased attention, however, between the 80th and the 131st kilometer.
The roads of the first street class are mainly dry, however, frozen.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov it can result, however, in ice smoothness in a step-by-step way.
The roads of the second and third street class are moist, and therefore the reference to possible frozen sections is valid also here.
Drivers should mainly be especially cautious on the less frequented streets in the Böhmerwald field.
Bezirk Olomouc
Drivers must reckon slush today, that in direction of the altitudes in the district Olomouc are on the way.
To the use of litter vehicles slush stays on the Červenohorské sedlo passport as well as on the street in direction Videlský kříž.
The Straßenmeistereien forced nocturnal snowfall to the use, in the circle Šumperk about 3 cm of fresh-fallen snow fell according to information of the street administration.
In the remaining fields of the district the roads are mostly without limit passable.
"In the circle Šumperk snow residues still agree on the altitudes.
On the Červenohorské sedlo passport the drivers" must "reckon" slush "in direction Jeseník, said an employee of the street administration Šumperk today opposite the agency ČTK.
Also their colleagues in the circle Jeseník must in the night, according to their information the streets are free and wet until the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the circle Olomouc the streets are without limit passable, in the circle Šternberk the drivers must go, however, cautiously in forest sections since the roads are still moist here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Bezirk Liberec
In north Bohemia the Straßenmeistereien announce now several badly passable street sections.
Next to several places with snow or ice smoothness the mountain street of Telnice according to Knínice is in the circle Ústí n.K. blocked to the traffic police according to information.
The temperatures remain also in deeper situations under zero so that snow and ice on the streets will hold themselves. On the other hand from the lowlands, in particular southeast of the Bohemian Low Mountain Range, no problems are announced, and the streets are normally dry there.
Up to now no interruptions of traffic flow are announced.
Ice smoothness is announced in particular from the vicinity by Štětí.
According to information of meteorologists there were for that ideal conditions in the night - during the day rain and melting snow, in the night of clear skies and frost.
Of the main distances lines as well as of the street I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and bad traffic conditions are announced to Liberec.
The blocking of the street between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches which were pressed from the snow load except the road.
Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about in little as a month the end of the world being supposed to occur?
That is one of those disaster announcements onto which we people jump so gladly.
With our band's The tap tap we rather make ourselves merry about that and say that we are the single band of the world which can gather sufficiently positive energy in order to stop the end of the world or to prevent.
In December you in addition realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers nearer?
It is a question of a national benefit performance which we plan already two years.
For that we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya-calendar whose end is in the morning predicted for the 21st December at 11:10 o'clock.
On the day in front of that, that is on 20th December, three concerts occur from 21:00 o'clock in Prague, Brno and Ostrava simultaneously.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be in about instance too the time at which on the Kiribati Pacific island that lies in a time zone about 12 hours before us the Maya-calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Initially presumably of me, afterwards we organized the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
At in order to prevent the end of the world we would like to gather energy not only sufficiently positive but we would like to think also together with the public about in which state we hand over this world to our children once.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar we developed also a unique collection from shoe, T-shirts, bag and key supporter against the end of the world with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can also support us.
The band The tap tap has together with other interpreters in addition also the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "End of the world turns out" picked up.
Already today the hymn is open YouTube very liked. Will it ring out also on the benefit performance concerts?
As a matter of course, and very indeed at the end of, presupposed that everything bangs and the end of the world does not occur...
The hymn is supposed to be sung by all interpreters on all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition the hymns are transferred together in a direct switching by the Czech Television live.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomás Hanák, which plays also the central figure of the Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings along...
How did you come to the cooperation with both of them?
We co-operate also with further personalities of the Czech culture scene, which is associated with our realizing many benefit performances and concerts...
We make an effort for binding these people intensely into our projects.
It was proved in this case that most are interested at a cooperation with us, and have fun at that.
Which purpose do the proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the equipment of the barrier-free training center Studeo which we work on already six years together with the association tap in the Jedlička-institute.
The pupils of the Jedlička-institute are looked after regularly by readers who help them in the case of different leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the means in order to consult the readers, we would like to help them in this way.
In frames of the finishing of the Jedlička-institute an own building is supposed to arise in which we move in then with this project.
At every concert several groups and interpreters perform.
For which criteria did you select these?
We wanted to put together a program that speaks to all generations including child.
In Prague China skis, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform for example.
You find out everything further on the internet page www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "big events" planned also for the future?
In May we perform for the first time at the Prager spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would like to perform also gladly in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are then in the USA already once - would connect this with appearances also gladly in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are just not small, up to now you are London already in Madrid, Brussels, or in Moscow occurred.
A group which consists of people with hindrances is The Tap tap, however.
How do you overcome these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It is not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are rotation chair drivers, that is the rotation chairs must be carried in the luggage hold. In addition we must drag along of course many instrument suitcases and other baggage...
Nonetheless it up to now always banged without problems, ČSA and British Airways were prepared always very much well that I was surprised sometimes in part already on us.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were not any problems.
Through your trips abroad you have a comparison as it looks in the single countries with barrier freedom as one deals with handicapped people there and so forth.
How did you experience these things up to now?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities in which everything functions better than with us we were witnesses of that just in Russia, that in the east still everything is in his beginnings.
Opposite Prague Moscow is completely not suitable for use by the handicapped. There it is still unusual if somebody is in the rotation chair only in the city center on the way.
It is not even natural there yet that one lets to a rotation chair driver for example in the elevator.
Fortunately associations which attempt to refer to the problems of people with hindrances arise also there.
And in which respect must we catch up opposite the countries kept on being developed?
There are still many things in which we hang afterwards...
It is still to be said, however, for this purpose that an improvement of the situation ever depends on the bothering of the concerned persons.
In London and Madrid it is completely usual that also people with difficult hindrances move independently in the public room, into the museum go, be able to use toilets and so forth.
It is just not, however, usual that a larger group of handicapped people participates in the social event actively there, in that we are tap tap with the band The the west ahead of a little!
A thing is respect in public and barrier freedom, but only if from our rows significant sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come, the things will really start changing oneself.
Up to now these are only individual cases of especially will-strong personalities.
The Tap tap is currently very much popular. If we, however, go back a few years: What motivated her in the year 1998 to founding a band?
Then I started as an attendant in the Jedlička-institute, where I met many young people who were interested at that, occupying oneself with something intensely.
And since I am even a musician and play saxophone among other things, I founded a Music limited company together with a colleague.
Na, and with the time something got out of control that as our presenter, Láďa Angelovič, uses to say (laughs).
The band was confessed, however, only in the last years, or am I mistaken?
It is right that the cooperation with known singers helped us; in addition we also started advertising ourselves actively.
It became conscious to us that the own achievement does not exist if one achieves something and this is not to be seen there to the outside in certain sense.
Thanks to the EU supporting-money can we us furthermore good readers, high-quality devices and and similar things. achieve.
Was it your objective to bring it to Tap so far with The Tap?
From the beginning I sensed the potential, that one can approach the things differently.
In the show business one today often copies the other one.
That is logical in his way since all new one with caution is considered and accepted first after longer time.
There are only few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap belongs to Tap for this purpose.
The first impression which the spectator has mostly is as a matter of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous because people with hindrances are not lonely and left beings who we would have to pity.
There are people who live a genuine life and can develop provided that they have the for this purpose necessary means.
I always say, that if people with hindrances succeed in something, that not only for them even a progress is, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a severe head as one hears about many people?
If one liked to make something good, one must not accept any compromises in many things and also a certain discipline must demand.
This is my opinion's, however, completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when find it then that they have the week of test twice, have to complete preparatory phases and transfer a lot of time onto concert journeys, then the enthusiasm ceases at many quickly.
So it functions, however, everywhere, in every band which wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently The tap has Tap twenty members.
How many of them were there from beginning at, that is since 1998?
Only an only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and the pleasure in the taking part, is with us always welcome.
Occurs on day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock
Places of event are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and further musicians
All three places of event are joined with each other to the end by live switching and a common interpretation of the hymn "End of the world" rings out "from" the band's The tap tap "falls.
It is an objective of the concert to find the means for the equipment of a multi-functional training center suitable for use by the handicapped that under the name STUDEO is supposed to arise in the Jedlička-institute in Prague. Matter of expense: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children to 12 years free, cards are available in the advance booking at Bohemiaticket.
Poles and the space.
Polen was picked up last week on a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European protection switching request space organization as a twentieth member of this space authority. Polen is in this way the second member country from the former East bloc (to Czechia, which became protection switching request member on 12th November 2008).
Poland began in the year 1994 a narrow cooperation with the protection switching request and participated in the following years in several protection switching request projects.
The way of Poland into the space began certainly much formerly.
Already before the Second World War occupied Polish cosmos-enthusiastic with the space travel in the case of which they did always not find sense in this way.
I remind here for example of the lecture of A. Šternfeld of the 6th December 1933 in the Warschauer observatory near which the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Entry for the cosmonautics".
The listeners let the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), however, coldly, and after years Šternfeld still remembered, that only Dr. Jan Gadomski Interesse had shown at his work.
Šternfeld won in the year 1934 for "Entry for the cosmonautics" the Prix REPPING-stag donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) an important advocate of the astronomy and the space travel became later.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books for these scientific disciplines.
Contribution worldwide acknowledged of Gadomskis to the development of the space travel was acknowledged among other things through one of the craters being named after it on the earth-averted page of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 a railroad hand trolley for which a rocket propulsion was planned was built in poles.
The author of the draft and the details of this intention remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clarified yet whether the missile should be used for the starting or for the braking of the hand trolley.
The information on that come exclusively from the contemporary press.
In the year 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-practiced projectiles.
The institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the studies in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents handed down it is clear that the research had advanced until the stage of practical tests.
The research was suspended then by the marching in of the German Wehrmacht certainly.
In the year 1937 the draft of a photoelectric hunt missile coming from Ing. Rohoziński emerged in the trade press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta" appeared "- torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war all projects for the military use of the rocketry were coordinated by the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two-year activity his work was ended, however, from the outbreak of war.
Further articles for the space travel were published after the war thanks to the work of the Polish space travel society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society occurs in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy in which four extensive articles are dedicated to the space travel.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the foundation of a space travel society.
At the time there were already the first projects for the satellite technique, and it was to be foreseen that the exploration of the space would have future.
Already in their beginnings in the year 1956 the Polish Space Travel Society PTA made an effort for an entry to the Internationalen confederation founded in 1951 for space travel, and in fact the PTA became already in the fall tidy member in 1956.
In the following year the first PTA chairperson became, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairpersons' of the International Confederation for space travel.
He held this office up to his death in the year 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA participated in a leading way in the development of the extremely successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for the scientific research.
The first type, that RM-1, was finished in the year 1957, the first start occurred on 10th October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did completely not weigh 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 RM-2 began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the two-stage rocket.
The missile was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be already to achieve real scientific work in the situation - the missile RM-34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of height winds.
In the year 1962, however, the further development was stopped.
The Meteor-1-Rakete developed in the years 1962 to 1965 became successor of the first missiles of the type RM.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, their overall length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed by this missile (Meteor-1A -1 bar and -1 C), that distinguished in the size of the transportation room from each other for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transportation room with 0.4 liters of capacity, Meteor-1B above 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C above 0.62 liters.
The maximum altitude was with all three types 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2-Rakete whose first flight tests began in October 1970 was developed in the aviation institute.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was in the situation to carry a working load of 10 kg to a height from about 60 km.
After that the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in the year 1960 which two years later the foundation of a national cosaving-committee followed in is Erwähnenswert.
Polen participated itself also in the astrionics with Soviet satellites within the framework of the intercosmos-program, and in the year 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution.
In the last week the constitution court canceled the law about non-profit works.
This decision caused a lively discussion in public.
It is in a certain way interesting to consider the problems natures once from a wider perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalisierten world are based on the principle of the unadjusted economical competition.
In the final effect this means that the single national economies stand in a permanent conflict with each other.
The principle of the free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the private capital which goes with unbridled finance speculations hand in hand is cause for that.
Due to the great differences of the value of work (Wages) it results in price tensions.
A state is to be meant by this concept, attempted at that of the manufacturers to consist in the economical competition through import of favorable goods when he "surpasses" the competition in order to tear a greater share of the market coverage through that at himself and to increase his profit.
In the big standard this means for most enterprises to move their manufacturing abroad or to shop there favorably, or to give up, however, you business. The result is a high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
There the private capital no social responsibility and so that also no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it supports, the government expenditures expenditures expenditures increase necessarily.
This situation is still intensified by the gentlemen being completely unwilling to entrepreneur paying their taxes and replacing the entire-social economical and social damages caused by them by that.
This situation is generally known so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this place.
The inconsiderate practice of the private capital manages in the single national economies to kick a situation in which the governments see themselves forced into competition with each other in order to lower the social level of the own population artificially and to lure foreign capital in this way into the country.
In other words: The governments hand over the own population without regard for the social consequences to the private capital.
This is shown in particular in changes of valid laws.
It is an objective of these measures to force the own population to accepting the dictation of the private capital in particular in the pay bracket.
On the one hand this happens through economic compulsion with the case of long-term unemployment, on the other hand through the curtailment of the employee rights.
Is the result wachsende poverty, as well as increasingly greater differences between arm and empire.
In Germany it is giving already for some years of public food delivery places for arms that are not more in the situation to eat through own work.
The number of the concerned persons goes already into the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy it results regularly in cases in which employees receive a so small wage that the state must increase their income up to the bare subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered also in the case of assistants personnel busy in the German Bundestag Federal Parliament.
The economy measures of practically all EU south states will come to the same state with the case of which the people are forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level undoubted to emigrate (how it was the case in the 19th century), or to suffer for a pittance on the fringe of the society and to hope in this case for sometime private investment capital flowing into the country.
Here the question, from where this capital comes, intrudes naturally?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty roams from a country into the other one; or the capital is completely missing now, because work in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa anyway the employees for one fraction of the European wages.
This completely affects Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim up to the satiety, that the state not participated in his own national economy with capital may, and that centrally managed economy leads to the economic disaster.
The private capital insists narrow-mindedly on his point of view, that the state may intervene not directing into the economy.
Then one must ask oneself, however, whether not the private capital the politics and in this way the entire state influences in the own egoistic sense or even controls.
Here the unequivocal answer is: Yes.
The proof of that is the existence of a lobby practically omnipotent and omnipresent in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the field of the corruption, the mutual Bevorteilung, a legislation, in which practically all sträflich is, however nothing punishable.
In Germany the situation is like this, that a Ministry of State for lack of finances private, charged thickly with the industry intertwined right enterprises with the preparation of bills.
These bills are adopted afterwards in the Bundestag Federal Parliament.
All power does not take the nation as a basis anymore then as it the western constitutions announce but of strong finance groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies turn out currently quickly into a situation, wie sie Appian in his work for the crisis of the roman republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius 'describes: "The state was already for a long time understood in the decay, and the offices were filled with power.
Against bribe, through unlawful acquisitions by false pretences of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption was rampant without restraint, and the nation went with already bought voices for the choice"... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state did not "have" any consul due to this downfall for eight months"... "One began already really to talk about that, that the only medicine is an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man must be elected"... Appian thought in this case indeed of Pompeius, but finally the strong man was then Cäsar that replaced the democracy by the autocracy permanently.
As shows, the present society is based just the same as in the antiquity on the inconsiderate preference of the own advantage without paying attention to entire-social interests.
The private capital is not already from his nature to recognize the advantage for the entire society and to put it through here in the situation.
The result, today as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites which do in the least not make an effort for deeply issued reforms.
We must search the cause for the appearance of the fascism and the communism in the inconsiderate liberalization of the economic systems therefore in the 19th and 20th century.
Seen from the present state, the fall of these regimes can be regarded for the benefit of liberal democracies as a certain pause in the case of which the next round already emerges.
The fact is especially catastrophic, that the present elites that in losses of a hundred dew sending of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters whose witnesses we are already today, possible for future, as well as suit the crimes against the humanity as we know it from the older and newer history in complete ignorance opposite.
The cancellation of the law about non-profit works is not a solution here, at least none durable.
Under the pressure of the global and European economical competition it will be forced to Czechia to search ways also furthermore in order to press the social level according to the population below.
This trend is therefore system-dependent.
Purposeful political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state at the economy that increase influence of the citizens to the government and weaken the monopoly of the private capital in the society for the benefit of the state are the only solution.
Israel: Lab of the chaos.
... "that nothing arises from power, or could ever arise Sting sings fragile in the song, that most important verse says in the refrain: "... so that we do not forget how in a breakable way we are".
"When my sons wanted none wars, there would not be any", the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, says, in the year 1849
After the last wave of the power between Israel and the Gaza Strip there was, as always, an immense number of reactions.
Ones are behind Israel and argue with his right to self-defense while they are calling the Palestinians terrorists; support the others in turn the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed at the Palestinian Arabs and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I would not like to write at this place about that, who in these always recurring waves of the killing guilty party and who Opfer is; finally the present inhabitants of Israel were born including the self-government fields into the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the power itself.
It is a question of revealing the readers the look behind the sceneries for me, the look on to whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) are particularly useful in the small spot country in the Near East.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are carried off by these and they follow from my own sense from who and/or which group of people influence the events of the modern history in a leading way.
In the first place the history of the mankind is a history of the fight for the power.
In every epoch we can form an Alexander the large one or a Napoleon.
What less is obvious is the question whether it was really always these personalities themselves that determined their steps autonomously, or whether behind their throne anyone stood that directed their actions to a predetermined objective.
We must admit to ourselves that we live in a time, in which the fortune of the world focuses in the hand of few individuals, and that this concentration of the money and the power following from that did not arise within the life insteps of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families one that one could designate as a head of the octopus (I do not know whether over them anyone still stands, I do not exclude this, however) pricks especially out - the Rothschilds.
A lot people do not write about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds already in the nineties of the 19th century in whose background always the Festigung of their power, the increase of their property or both stood in order to stop the connection of their name with highly-criminal actions.
The Rothschilds are shared at almost all central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not participated in the central banks they lead wars or equip onto these (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the assault onto Iraq it was 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis only another four stayed at which Russia in the meantime subordinated his central bank to the Russian government).
Who attempted to oppose to this family had to pay with the life for that.
Abraham Lincoln refused it, to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank began, during the civil war, own (speak: state) to hand over bank notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began, to hand over own bank notes and the FED wanted to eliminate - he was murdered in 1963; the representative Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED because of triggering of the world economy crisis in the year 1929.
The global power desires of the Rothschilds led in the years - 1871 for the formulation of a plan to the Entfesselung of three world wars in 1859 through Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and in this way highest degree of the discovery.
The first war had to the aim of eliminating the big monarchic state beings of Europe, in particular the colonial domination of Great Britain should be broken by the second war, and the third war is supposed to reduce the world population - 1 billion people on about 0.5 (such a number would provide their comforts and their luxury and would not consume either as many resources), create a universal religion (the ecumenicism does not keep on being anything here as the front end) and finally lead to the takeover of the absolute power.
The method, with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works on the top, the triggering of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution is (order off chao - order from the chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong and always lead to the aggravation of the situation (see foundation of the FED, so that crises as the one activated by them in the year 1907 are not repeated).
After they had succeeded through the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo in activating the First World War, they destroyed the Russian czar empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden one, militarily and economically unfounded capitulation Germany (for the destruction of the Russian czar empire the war was not more necessary), afterwards the solution of the Central European major power of Österreich-Ungarns occurred.
In order to more simply be able to provoke the Second World War, the bankers made get a latent conflict situation through the politics in their allocating Germany with gigantic war reparations; through that they got the condition of impoverished masses, so that they the German only another sufficiently strong leader unterjubeln must, that designated the guilty parties and offered simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority who should take the function of a fifth column and also took in order to provoke the war fire.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the foundation of the Zionist movement in the case of which a branch strove for the foundation of a Jew state if possible on the historical field of Judäas with Jerusalem as a capital (Return after Zion).
The already mentioned Balfour-declaration created the assumption for the mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it resulted in first collisions with the resident Arabian population.
There were terrorist attacks on both pages.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler tore himself away now from the chain to which the international bankers had kept it initially, or whether everything ran according to plan, is to be estimated only heavy, in any case the sorrow of the European Jews created the assumption for the recognition of the Jewish state in the concentration camps through the world community.
Israel was set up in the year 1948, and in the same way as the ground was prepared by the war reparations against Germany for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in provoking this war, the Jewish nation becomes similar as in the Second world war to the victim in the most front combat line, this time together with the Arabian and/or Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel is not only in the country itself as a gigantic lab, a source of the quarrel and the chaos, but also international (one only thinks of how the people subdivide themselves into supporters and opponents of Israel sharply).
Who the guilty party is and who the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where wrong activates only wrong in an endless spiral of the power, at which at the beginning the greed individual and their aspiration to global power stood?
One must differentiate here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, nevertheless the international bankers put in Israel just the same as with us, the nation, exclusively their own candidates for the choice.
The present prime minister of Israel, the falcon Netanjahu, is a typical example a politician's fascism-delicate, the international bankers loyally turned out that does everything for in order to provoke a war with Iran which (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), rapid for a global conflict could stretch, and at the it because of the control of Iran about the street of Hormus only 2 miles wide run across the 20% of the worldwide oil deliveries for a destruction of the world economy could come.
In which light do the words of David Rockefellers appear there from the year 1994: "The only one that we need is one all converting crisis, and the people will welcome the new system of the world."
In their idea the new system of the world is a world of the gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the human population of a small group of finance aristocrats uses the rest.
To subject a world in which a chip is implanted to every newborn at the birth around this being of the total control.
"And it does, that the small ones and the large ones, the rich men and the paupers, the free ones and the farmhands all give a multiplication sign onto their right hand or onto their forehead, that do not buy or nobody can sell, he has then the multiplication sign, that is the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Who has intelligence, that one considers the number of the animal.
Because it is a human being's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: Wenn's most badly stands, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a mob of demonstrating Islamic students filled the US American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release they demanded the delivery over of the Schahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi brought down who had fled into the USA which had preserved the patronage over decades about his regime after the revolution.
For the American government there was not from this situation any positive way out - she could not afford to fling the Schah overboard there this the confidence of their allies in other countries massive would have damaged.
It was not simultaneous in the situation, in Iran, where the revolution led to the use of a theocratic regime, to put through the release of the hostages.
It was a difficult stroke for the call of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco during the violent attempt of the hostage liberation made everything only even worse.
Finally the captured diplomats were released after 444 days after negotiations had been provided through the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian atmospheres at home.
The collapse in Iran contributed considerably to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan at the premiership choices in the year 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history which brought a small partial victory to the USA.
Immediately before the occupation of the message six message employees succeeded in the flight.
This ended according to numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA succeeded in collaboration with the Canadian authorities in bringing the refugees from Iran; in this case an extravagant story for the Verdeckung of their true identity helped them - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflagedly as members of a film stick that supposedly went to locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of the genres
The plan developed by the expert for "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, required also the cooperation of Hollywood.
So that the camouflage became credible, articles were published about this film project in technical journals papers, press conferences were kept off, and the fictitious production society had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept a secret long. The film is based on the memories from Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand he is a realistic Politthriller, simultaneously, however, also a so-called "Caper Movie", that is the history of a succeeded coup de main as for example the film Ocean's Eleven.
Through that the atmosphere levels are changed in the film off - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film composure of the same situations there are not any great differences).
On the other hand the loose passages from Hollywood that ironically and slightly überspitzt come from there.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the discussion table, on the office fields, at the telephone...
Ben Affleck succeeded in a remarkable restart start of his career with this film.
From an actor smiled at one became respectable director, and also as an actor he is not now the objective of ironic comments anymore.
Argo is not his third feature film after the thriller Any Children's Game's Play (Centesimal degrees baby centesimal degrees, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
Simultaneously it is Afflecks first film not to play in the native Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged in this case to the features which removed the previous films of this director from the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck proves this feeling, however, also in Argo, where Tehran "is played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really occurred - the input sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in their clarity, and nevertheless provides in this case the feeling of the Verwirrtheit and the Unvorhersehbarkeit that sets in if the history moves somewhere once.
A similar effect achieves Affleck with his team also with the case of fictitious scenes (the wrong film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director had to deal also with actually the history not offering many scenes being tight in the cinematic sense.
With the Little which he helps the reality with sometimes a little it works, however, quite successfully - what then does not work always so elegantly (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis is averted from a telephone call on the airport in Tehran in America, or also the pursuit hunt on the runway, seem a little artificial).
The weakness of Argo is to have to show his far too wide dispersion which is necessitated by the necessity too much at action at too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very much indeed charming in their roles as Hollywood-employees, their figures would have earned, however, more room, and in this way they do not stand alone by far in the film.
Afflecks film loses attraction a little through that. It is a film, that one pursue with certain interest and in this case the organization and the one goutieren onto retro-style reminding a thriller from the 70th years can.
It wakes enthusiasm only heavily, however.
As memory at one until today in certain way live piece history and as an evidence of that as cladded, however, the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are it is sufficient, however.
Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The servers' www.bankovnipoplatky.com who pages an inquiry annually about the most absurd bank fees decided this year on organizing the competition "Most absurd regulation and/or idea from the EU workshop".
"The plan recently proposed by the EU to introduce a woman rate from 40% in the management of big European companies brought us to this idea", said Patrik Nacher, who takes care of the organization of this inquiry, opposite the newspaper Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities the judgment of the European court of justice is found for example about the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then women enjoyed with the case of life assurances an advantage because they represent a smaller risk objectively for the assurance companies companies.
"Wider incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated until end of this year.
The actual vote occurs then until end February 2013", Nacher informed.
For the controversial EU regulations the obligatory addition of bio-ethanol belongs among other things to fuels, that is in their consequence nature-damaging, furthermore the prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because these contain a relatively small amount of this danger material, or also the guideline to the size of chicken cages, because of which became this year of eggs considerably more expensive.
Criticism received in the past also the actual prohibition of the use of the concept "butter spread" or also the sale prohibition for traditional electric bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus decides often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry whose demands are represented by a or several member countries in Brussels normally (so Czechia attempts currently for example to put through the demands of Czech banks also with veto-threat).
Lobby-interests also supported that bananas of the highest grade must be at least 14 cm long in the EU and must not show any "curve anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself in this case with the argument that it harmonizes only the uneven single state norms which would hinder the trade.
The norms concerning fruit and vegetable were already softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries with the tip, that the previous guidelines would lead to a wastage from food.
A candidate for the victory in this inquiry is possibly the EU regulation of the last year that the tip must be equipped with according to balloons with the case of the sale that children must not blow up the balloon under eight years without supervision of an adult.
The EU referred in this case to an American study according to which balloons are the leading cause during the death from suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is valid already for children to 14 years during the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Also a guideline that affects the European officials themselves is relatively absurd - everyone that takes an official function in the EU must not use the denomination Macedonia for Greece because of the sensitivity of the topic and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead of this.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in collaboration Laissez Faire with the association of liberal economists next to the o.g. absurdities also the EU regulation of the extent of food inventory on the field of a member country.
The EU defined in this way the Höchstvolumen at food inventory which was allowed to be found at the day of our EU entry on the field of the Czech Republic.
Czechia exceeded then e.g. the defined volume for mushroom canned food for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the inquiry were also from the idea impressed or, however, of the idea to give supporting-money for requests for supporting-money.
These ideas came certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are put at a disadvantage by our not having any sea.
We will "apply" near the EU for restitution", declared in the fall the former agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in 2004.
As an argument he mentioned that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czechia has a further way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
Finally The European Commission complied with Czechia so far that she organized an announcement to countries which do not have any access to the sea about the purchase from grain.
The ministry offered supporting-money for requests for supporting-money to the municipalities for regional development under the orders of minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), actually it should be a question in this case of means for the Aufsetzung of supporting money requests at Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations become in the member countries the target of the criticism which earns efforts of the EU around regulation and in this way also around effectiveness and development of the entire European Union in opinion of some experts, however, rather of recognition easily indeed.
The EU supporting-money is rather a more serious problem in opinion of these experts for projects which do not have anything with the deepening of the European integration together at all in that, which, however, were forced by single member countries at the budget negotiations.
Also the fact that Czechia must fight for the right to use of specific denominations of traditional products similar to other member countries in Brussels and does always not gain this fight in this case causes emotions in these parts.
Czechia could defend the denomination "Olomoucké tvarůžky" indeed after a six year long fight with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename the Inländerrum (Tuzemský for that) whose tradition goes back with us until the 19th century in "Tuzemák", however.
The Denomination For that may be used only for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beets.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU dive in the society of the world-famous cheese sorts Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker marzipan's or the Parma ham's now also the Karlsbader rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer hop on.
With a EU brand can boast there the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles.
"The people want that I save the republic, but I am only an amateur", says Okamura.
Mr senator, how does one come to the idea to run for the office of the president?
It is not a question of being senator or president for me.
If in our country all without problems functioned, I would not present myself anywhere.
But I do not keep up more notice how the republic is raided for 20 years as thieves run free while the taxes and the retirement age are being increased to the people.
I had not become any aspirations politician.
If I, however, see something which I do not like, I attempt then to suggest a solution in order to change this.
And since I am already over 40, and for this purpose independent and independent, I do not have any other possibility to influence the things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
Into the senate you got it and then now onto the way into the castle done.
Do you not turn your voters the back through that?
I told myself the whole time, that I will incorporate the fight for the castle according to the result of the senate choices.
Later I specified this and said that I will run for the office of the president provided that I am elected as the senator.
My objective is not, however, the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
I need a lot of influence and a mandate as strong as possible for that if possible.
The difficulty does only not consist, however, in our chiding as a nation in the pub and before the television set, but massacring everyone who wants to change something.
The media who want to rob one of the honor, and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie come to that.
Over was asserted for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was a consultant of Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You incorporated the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and legal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive property declarations above 20 million crowns.
For this purpose you must change laws.
As a president you do not have any competences in this respect, and only the senate as a whole can be law proposals worth.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen I supported the guide remaining a free trade, and this could be put through.
The problem is the small-intellectual politics - when somebody of the right or comes from the left with a good proposal, this is refused on purpose, and that only stops the population.
As an independent independent I have a by far greater potential to gain support near all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage consists in my being able to take without drawer thinking and party dogmas from every party what is the best thing for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in the politics rather to the right or to the left?
From Czech view it seems to me that the people see me rather to the left.
For me this right-link-thinking is, however, completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we get on.
It does not go to me around whether anyone belongs to the left one or to the right warehouse; I would like to bandage the people.
Always I support in public every good implementation approach even if this of the KSČM or of the ODS comes, and in the same way I will oppose bad ideas.
It displeases to you if somebody calls you populists.
But do you not confirm that through what you just said?
If you make a business plan in a company, you have also an ideal objective and a vision then.
And you would like to come closer to this.
One can refer to this as populism because of me, but all proposals which I spoke of already function in the world, or they were discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament you have only catchwords.
And in this way you do not come in the politics on a long-term basis far.
Or do you think that you will succeed in putting through the material and legal liability for example if you talk only long enough to the people?
I do not have any other possibility.
To convince politician, journalist and the public and to attempt, to bring page in order to put through these objectives they on our.
As a president it would not be a problem for me to call the chairpersons of the parliament parties for that live on televison to anchor the material and legal liability for politicians, officials, judges and public prosecutors by law.
And the addressed ones would have to say then where appropriate why they refuse this.
A strong personality who refers to grievances can exert pressure on the political scene.
Only take the direct choice of the president which was an income of the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am not either a genius or an intellectual.
I attempt to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just began with the politics first and attempt to find the support of the majority for my program.
I always attempt to judge the things themselves; and if it does not bang, I go back then in six years to the private sector again.
That rings a little bit as if Okamura should save Czechia.
I am not a rescuer.
I know that I do not achieve only anything; therefore I talked with several known personalities about whether they would not like to run also for the senate.
I spoke e.g. with Radim Jančura, who, however, refused because of overwork.
In addition I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who uncovered the fraud during the trade with light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am not more sure.
Sixty percent of the elective ones did not go at all for the choices, and those who went elected representatives of the establishment mostly.
In the senate we are in this way only two independents.
The people chose such senate composition, that changes will be only very much hardly durchsetzbar.
In spite of that I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct choice of the mayors and district head men.
Do you think about the foundation of an own party?
Over that because my not having any time I did not think about checking the past of every potential party member yet and has also not at all the money for that.
I do not have money for the president campaign once yet; only 20,000 CZK are on my transparent account.
You do not have any money?
You speak of property declarations, as yours would look?
I estimate my private assets at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, that is worth to about 10 million as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb to whom about a million is worth. And then I have still a few millions on the account.
The Aston Martin was after all the way a child dream - I always liked James Bond as it went in the car, was gallantly to women and fought against the evil simultaneously.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a property of 60 million and do not have any money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in that.
That is just not convincing.
I do not have any 15 million for the campaign.
Am I supposed to do for instance debts?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsors shows that my program does presumably not wake interest too much.
And I am not obliged to deny the campaign from own means.
The costs for the campaign are covered basically through my salary as a senator.
But I could not live from the senator content alone; so I could not finance e.g. my son the English school which tastes 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to earn only money, I would run for quite nothing.
Do you remain active therefore further as entrepreneurs in order to have your living?
Did you not say that you will drive back these activities?
But that is not associated with the height of the salary.
How promisedly, did I drive back my activities in part.
Like this becomes e.g. my deputy in the spring manager of the travel agency.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the republic.
But nevertheless I must live also on something.
Onto which month income were you accustomed as entrepreneurs?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also furthermore like this.
I would completely employ my enterprises as a president, however.
You find the complete conversation in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove, that the true adventures are not only in the head - at the example of Spijkenisse and the recently constructed book mountain - 2 photos
"I find the building merry, it looks futuristic, and seeing something interesting again at last gives", says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by, at the street edge.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large-scale enterprise seemed likely, means: "However it is beautiful already, the house."
But I wonder what we need a library for today still.
They all have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human being goes today voluntarily yet into one of these Old-Style-Bibliotheken, or?
Spijkenisse, a hardly inspection-needy sleep city in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant-municipality shows the lowest education rate of the entire Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, one decided on contributing to the general education and reproducing the seven fictitious bridges which are represented on the euro appearances as prettily painted reinforced concrete miniatures some years ago.
The success of the education offensive held itself in borders.
And so the city fathers recognized that there would be only an only possibility, to become gentleman the statistics: A library must here!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architect's office MVRDV, master of the reckless bar graphs and producer of witty, really often cynical constructions, took the thing with usual composure and appeared for the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books among the arm and a grin in the face.
And while the jury was looking still baffledly around itself and twitching with the armpits, stacked the insolent Meuse his exquisite little presents of the size after to a pyramid and his aktionistisch supported speech with the words ended: "Love municipality"!
It is that therefore, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later the mountain 30 million euros expensive is heaped up.
He is a part of a revitalization project which also basement garage, supermarket, mail office and a few bordering living and row houses with in total 50 apartments belong to.
At the beginning of November "Best library" was characterized the book mountain with the second price "of NL 2012".
In addition the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
In this way the faceless small town retort is, that until dato more did not have to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a consternatedly ugly city hall behind whose white facades one would be inclined to presume a dairy factory around a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Particularly, however, Spijkenisse has now the first public culture construction in the history of his existing.
The long way for the book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese dish with glass cover.
There is indeed a lift that leads right through the massif, however, the true room and reading joys open up at the fußläufigen Climb Up the topography.
The rundum glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker ground and the elegant street-lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public city place.
The urbane ambience is perfect.
One holds already look-out of Jungs playing to park bench, dog and soccer and girl.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle a big, dark room lies which is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We put the classical room configuration on the head and put the read area to the outside from inside.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is skillfully used: In the middle offices, internet-library, Schachclub, environmental center and housing technical services headquarters lie.
The black bookshelves are a special joy, the once wall paneling, once parapet, once staircase rail are.
Optics, Haptik and odor are strange.
Even confirmed architects and civil engineers engineers shake the unknown material's the head.
"We wanted to work here with recycling-materials", declares Joop Trouborst, project leader manager near the municipality Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so we found a suitable waste product in a friesländischen farm of a day from the agriculture.
For many years one is using a millimeter-thin synthetic fleece as a root pad in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields.
That is cheap and time-efficient.
To the thin textile keeps, two Saisonen, after that it is ripe for the bulky waste.
For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these amounts - to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat action and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, load-capable material which smells a bissl to new cars and a bissl to trainer discolors itself.
To 105 stages one arrived at the peak.
At the end of the almost 500 meters long journey one is rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic prospect on the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted Ficusbäumen.
You guarantee for Atmosphäre, for, however, for the correct humidity, in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"One would not believe it, but this house is a showing-project as regards in spite of the many glass faces ecology", says Trouborst.
Heated and chilled becomes with geothermal heat.
Although the book mountain stands under a glass fall, the sun shines even on sunny days only shortly into the interior.
The wide wood glue ties that stand perpendicular to the glass facade are used as shading and catch a majority of the solar radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Finish the rest fully automatic window blind.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT branch, risked already the way into the new library.
Also Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher Cynthia Bogarde that "for a long time overdue soul" even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisses.
The reason: For the opening few weeks ago every inhabitant was invited to to donate a book from his personal supply.
The optical gaps are supposed to be filled with that for the time being once in the library completely not equipped yet - currently 70,000 pieces.
The draft opened.
The shelves are to obenhin filled.
"Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library is", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think thanks to our invitation every inhabitant has now a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to the glory.
In this way MVRDV succeeded in that royal discipline which one mentions identity foundation in the jargon.
Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.
So jung und ungebildet they also likes to be.
That is at last a starting point for identity once.
Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote about the photo from Palestine.
Loud Stephen Szabo, expert for Us European Relationships, Berlin in this way balances on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: At the beginning of the week Germany had signaled first of all that it the Palestinian would vote against the request for an observer status near the United Nations.
Then, however, Berlin contained itself.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis put into Gaza.
Now Germany must be cautious due to his special relationship with Israel, however.
However, simultaneously I believe that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being, however, too critically opposite Israel.
During the revolt in Libya in March 2011, when it was a question of fitting out a flight prohibition zone, Germany also abstained.
Finally this was put through by the NATO.
Does Germany fell it heavily to get a clear position with the case of important international topics?
Yes, that is right.
That fits, that his foreign policy just rearranges it and indeed away from a politics that became gemanaged so to speak from the USA there for a German foreign policy.
Complicating comes, that the Europeans do not have any coherent and homogeneous politics.
The Germans find themselves therefore between the fronts against.
One expects of them that they play a more independent role, at that they are not, however, accustomed.
I believe, they still approach their role, but they are on the way for a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What means a "normal" foreign policy actually from German view?
It shows the willingness to get with the case of national interests also positions which are independent from those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy of the economic policy is motivated therefore from the exports and his relationships to certain regions, about instance Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are different to a certain degree than those of the other great powers are and therefore Germany must protect his interests.
These economic interests had influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand Germany has big markets in the Near east, especially in the Gulf State.
Therefore it must be cautious, the public, but also the elites, not to bump before the head in the Arabian countries.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to that either, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But an important role plays in any case in German considerations.
Germany damaged his relationships with the USA when it abstained with the case of important decisions about instance during the vote above Palestine?
I believe, there is great sense for the German position in Europe and even in the USA.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Maybe Germany in this way will record even a certain respect.
Because nevertheless it signals that it is taken as international player seriously and his interests must be considered.
There are in Europe different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The USA on the other hand spoke out clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Due to the American inside politics these varieties always existed.
I believe that the government has presumably quite a lot of sense for the European position secretly under Obama.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot represent this position publicly of course.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not so great at all as they always appear.
If you have a look at the relationships between Obama and prime minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so hellauf enthusiastic of Netanjahus politics at all then.
Does Germany fell it heavily to arrange his narrow relationships with Israel and the USA on the one, and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other hand?
I believe, exactly that it does so difficult for the Germans.
It would be natural a little more simply for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European politics which currently is not the case.
Therefore they cannot be a part of a wider line and things must drive forward instead of this out of their own position.
They straighten that with the euro.
I believe, in future Germany will take over a leading role, to insist Europe on a European position.
That is not natural simply for Germany, already because of the relationship to Israel.
That was always already a sensitive topic.
But I believe that it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself even in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to take over a title role anyway?
Or does Germany fell the leading role still heavily?
Germany is not yet used to that, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
If we have a look for example at the euro crisis, there most different anti-German feelings become free each time if Germany accepts a bigger role.
That does simply not do it to the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is so seen in a much more difficult position as the USA.
It must be prone to most different neighbors and opinions and that is not simple.
Now the influence of the USA takes in the European politics continuously off, the EU does not fill at the moment this vacuum, however, who stays there otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they do not like it, it is it unpleasant to them and it makes it still much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Protection of trade marks" in China: If puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What, however, is Armani Polo?
Behind that a denomination very officially entered into China which, however, does not have to do anything with the origin enterprises hides itself.
Nevertheless she enjoys for so long protection as the actual name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they are right.
"It becomes for foreigners increasingly more difficult to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, attorney in the office Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on industrial property rights injuries in Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Already a few additional letters suffice the imitators so that they may announce their brands.
Lu-Gucci simply becomes like this from Gucci, instead of Prada one makes enter Prada-Kny.
Also German enterprises are copied in this way legally, about instance the sport article manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the brand office in Peking.
On 14th September 2010 a Chinese enterprise made there protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that operated itself also near the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in the copying and in the injured person of intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multistorey department stores which almost sell excluding forgeries.
Pattlochs cases, however, are different: On behalf of his mandators he proceeds against Chinese enterprises of the brand office receiving very officially the right to use a denomination which is already elsewhere protected.
The Chinese mention that "Bang Mingpai", a co-driver brand.
The word bases itself on "Bang Dakuan".
In this way women are meant, that catch rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves
"That is business-damaging, one must "oppose" it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand that alone position disappears is watered down, the image damage is enormous."
The financial failure rates and the process costs of the affected branches go into the millions, particularly with the case of expensive showing-products.
According to information of the market analysis society CLSA the third-biggest market for luxury articles and that at the fastest wachsende is China with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
However, deletions of dubious entries in the brand register are to be achieved heavily and go into the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can drag on, with uncertain exit.
Pattloch reports about cases in which the court rejected complaints because after the long duration the name complained about became the "market reality".
If the complainant has bad luck, he must pay the plagiarist even money because it hurt his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails here.
Famous cases affect also graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machine machinery manufacturer Sany, that enterprise that recently Putzmeister took over the German concrete pump farmer.
The Chinese may use therefore until today a mark which resembles the Mercedes-star.
The Volvo-buyer Geely used initially a blue-white logo, the one reminded of BMW; the quarrel was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who made the famous crocodile look into the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any fault to themselves.
The brand office CTMO in Peking admits indeed that there were over there bottlenecks in 2010 because of too small personnel and room equipment.
In the last year one "returned", however, from the "emergency situation in the workflow process for the normality".
So the supply of raw objection procedures sank around 22 percent.
One finished almost 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless 81,500 objections still wait in the office for execution.
Fighting against that costs a lot
How so often are in China the numbers impressing.
In the last year more than 1.4 million requests paid attention to protection of trade marks at the CTMO, almost a third more than 2010.
That is a record and means, that China for the tenth time behind each other the list of the new entries in all world would start, the authority informs.
That is valid also for the supply of all valid trademarks in total 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011 1.8 billion Yuan were taken at fees.
Simplifies is said that, that every registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting against that costs a multiple as the case of the German family company joy mountain shows.
For more than seven years the company group is fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Indeed the Germans could achieve that his illegal manufacture of copied motor vehicle parts was dug.
Nevertheless the imitator kept on safeguarding himself the Chinese rights at the brand joy mountain.
One himself missed that since in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairperson of the management of joy mountain of Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office CTMO also rejected the objection of the inhabitants of Munich then.
In the next two authorities Freudenberg was right indeed, however, the opposing party kämpft weiter until today.
One must look out infernally
Now the matter is pendant before the Uppermost Court of Justice.
It is confident to Wentzler to bring the thing to a good end and the professionalism of the courts praises.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely extensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerve."
The internal costs could hardly be numbered, the company archive had had to check files even a hundred years old in order to produce proofs.
Five years ago joy mountain of the opposite side offered in vain a "high six-digit" euro amount" for the settlement.
"At that one sees how much that is worth to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers in Far East tend to splash even to Europe back.
Then same, if unprotected brands are safeguarded to imitators there.
So a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the denomination joy mountain in Germany for shoes and leathers.
The company group gave up this business field for a long time, in spite of that it could avert the registration.
"One must look out infernally", says Wentzler.
Both it and the attorney Pattloch recommend German enterprises to be very cautious with the case of businesses with China.
Relying on international Markenrechte does not suffice, rather the foreigners should announce all which is somehow sensitive also in China as Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become much more expensive than the registration can.
In fact: If Freudenberg is defeated in the last act of his brand drama, one would have to pay presumably the opposite side royalties then for the own name, declares Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the segment in question from the market.
Weltaidstag: Stamp, to sing help,
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland Aidswaisen are pleased with that.
The history of a connection which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First the stamping is there: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady court shoes and Herrenslipper search the time on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
Unity-two-three-four.
Then first the voices of the singers swell slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - badger, beguile and pursue.
And it almost lifts Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, from his material shoes if it combines her with his supplely wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the choir Imbongi practises a new song.
Onto the fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, of the humane geneticist up to the househusband.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice also still has another text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, that of eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and and in parts of Swaziland is spoken.
Help for the self-help
Worldwide about 34 million HIV-Infizierte there is, Unaids, the program of the United Nations to the Bekämfung of Aids, estimates that.
23.5 million people of them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live.
Meanwhile more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 Aidswaisen in the village Esitjeni the Voices for Africa association found godfathers in Germany.
70 of them a weiterführende school visit.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees school fee, school uniform and a warm meal to the child daily in the Gogo-center.
History narrator or also Lobpreiser means Imbongi in Zulu.
Nobody can speak the Bantu language fluently in this room, but sing it.
For almost ten years the choir is practising songs in this foreign soft language and it returns now and then also there, where they come initially: into the south of Africa.
Because 8 733 kilometers air line remote of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swasiland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple loam and straw huts, children are a majority of them.
In more than 300 of them no parents have more because these succumbed to the HI-virus.
In Esitjeni it is proved on a small scale what Swaziland completely suffers from: highest HIV-Infektionsrate, lowest durability worldwide loud Unicef.
Curtailments of the masculine prepuce that reduces the contagion risk nachweislich around half are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people in Swaziland take the immune weakness virus into themselves, to die with middle thirty is not a rarity.
At a common Africa journey in the spring 2005 the choir discovered the village, vor allem, however, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets that did not lack only parental welfare but simple at everything: Essen, clothing, education.
Without graduation one does not have first right any chance in a poor country.
At the beginning it was still the private engagement individual to send a child to the school for a few euros per year and to make a warm meal for him possible on day.
However, already a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which takes care of the Aids-orphans since then almost professionally in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexually transferable infections
What are the most important sexually transferable illnesses?
Syphilis, Chlamydien and gonorrhea (Gonorrhö) number among the bacterial STI.
Frequent viral STI are HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Crab lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main concerned person groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur particularly with men who have sex with men.
The Robert-cook-institute assumes that at least four are transmitted through sexual contacts by five of all syphilis-cases announced in Germany between men.
With the heterosexual adults Chlamydien infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (Mushroom), gonorrheas and Humane Pappilomaviren are frequent occurring sexually transferable illnesses.
The circulation of HIV is comparably small among heterosexual adults in these parts - nevertheless: About 20 percent of the HIV new infections are allotted to this group.
Among young people Chlamydien-infections occur considerably more frequently than with the case of other population groups.
To European elevations three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
In these parts Humane Pappilomaviren occur furthermore frequently with young people.
How did the number of the infections develop?
Not all sexually transferable illnesses are orache-liable.
The number of the syphilis infections has itself according to the Robert cook institute of 1697 illnesses in the year 2001 on 3698 illnesses in the year 2011 more than duplicated.
The number of the HIV new infections goes back since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
That is about instance a tenth less before than per year.
Which symptoms refer to a venereal disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital organ field, complaints during the Urinieren, outflow, lower abdomen pains as well as bubbles or warts.
Often they cause, however, no pains or other symptoms and remain therefore unnoticed.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of a contagion, do not offer, however, any one hundred percent protection.
Because partially exciters of sexually transferable illnesses can be passed on also through grease infections and narrow body contact.
Therefore experts recommend regular investigations particularly with sex partners changing frequently.
Early diagnoses can most STI cured and be avoided late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least the fees, that the choir in whole Germany ersingt, some comes together.
"In total we sent already about 200 000 euros according to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairperson of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement-strong woman, administers the money from Germany.
She also sees to the orphans unterkommen well at one of the grandmothers for instance.
The Gogos as one mentions the old women in Zulu the pillars of the village are.
Some of them received up to 14 orphans with themselves, give them a roof above the head and guarantee for the children appearing in their uniforms every day on time for the school instruction.
Who does not have anybody anymore comes into the protection house to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just the same by the association as the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore "Voices for Africa" started up a nearer school, built it two chicken houses and organized it together with the American health organization PSI, that many make in the village a HIV-Test have to do.
That is not a self-evident fact, because so obviously the illness in the whole country is also, one is silent they most gladly dead.
A king with 14 wives
"Aids is an absolute taboo, Annette Lennartz says, because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country in which the king holds himself to 14 wives officially.
The last absolute monarch Schwarzafrikas, king Mswati III, is known to his excessive life-style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it is owed also to this from a government viewpoint sanktionierten way of life that the HI-virus spread so quickly in the last decades.
But also the many migrant workers who take the virus through the country.
There would be free condoms indeed at every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "however those ones are hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to support the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels all two, three years together through the south of Africa and the a lot one still sings songs of full wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, at the southern corner of the black continent from times of the apartheid know.
A bus fuller white that sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only atmosphere and joy, but wrested already from some grim border guards a few tears.
The journey always leads also after Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Goes according to Esitjeni, there is the light" the people say there.
And when one returns the 8733 kilometers air line to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers into the test room at the Bergheimer street, then one sees it shining also there.
Messenger: Eis discovers NASA on the Mercury
The probe Messenger found proofs of there being ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice is supposed to be possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The NASA US aerospace administration proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the sun next, there is also there frozen water, as follows from three studies published on Thursday in the compartment magazine "Science".
The probe Messenger found proofs of there being an ice in the region of the planet lying permanently in the shadow.
This is supposed to be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water came presumably from comets or possibly also asteroids which struck on the Mercury.
Nobody relates the find with the existence of lives from ice, however, on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-Sonde, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
The finds could help, however, with clearing how water and other elements stones of the life reached other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed from the mortals probes, telescopes and small robots as phoenix are there, to explore the depths of the cosmos.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth: Small spyholes into infinite widths.

The eight planets of our solar system, in addition the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, who circles behind Neptune around the sun, Ceres is to astronomical according to the new definition of terms of the Internationalen union of 2006 no "planet".

One of the greatest and sharpest photos of the Hubble-telescope: The whirlpool separator galaxy
According to color photos of spiral galaxies become true work of art.
The photo published from the European South Observatory shows the Trifid-fog several thousands of light-years remote in the constellation floodgates.
The name Trifid comes from the roman word trifidus (dreigeteilt, three-fissured), there the glowing heart of the star Geburtsstätte darkens dust patrols dreiteilen.
In the constellation snake carrier astronomers photographed the heralds of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years of the earth away the cores of two galaxies melting together on each other race too and will collide inevitable with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble-telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
To whom technical abbreviations do not suit, that one likes to mention it Southern Fire Wheel with the case of their nickname.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a section from the iris fog in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years remote fog consists of dust granules which are smaller ten to a hundred times than usual house dust.
This picture was joined together from optical and X-ray photos of different telescopes.
It shows a ring from black holes, 430 million light-years of the earth away.
The space telescope Hubble included this group of galaxies, mentioned Arp 273, for Nasa.
Scientists UGC 1810 name the bigger spiral galaxy.
The brightest group of young stars of our galaxy is in this star fog.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star-cloud, connected with the rosette-fog, brings constantly new baby stars - 5000 light-years of the earth away out.
In this galaxy shining brightly with a small black Loch still no dust, but only gas exists.
Presuming more brashly that it arose only shortly according to the Urknall than in the universe hydrogen was mainly to be found.
Our insights into the space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is supposed to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - still before Galileo Galilei used it a year later for the star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became increasingly bigger - and the insights that supply it, increasingly deeper.
30 years long, indeed of 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Teleskop was San Diego near in the Palomar observatory the biggest telescope of the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
It approves looks into the space to more than two mirrors now, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the grain of Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma is gigantic - only the mirror comes to 10.4 meters in the diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
In spite of that it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is lashed up in his altitude angle height - and restricted in his mobility in this way.
Also the hobby-Eberly-telescope in Texas is fixed in the altitude angle height.
His special feature: the high light collecting-strength.
This reaches indeed - in spite of comparably small mirror diameter - onto which the worldwide biggest reflecting telescopes'.
With the aid of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to the space to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Every computer owner can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) when he provides computer power power.
Look at the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope stands - that his name all honor does.
With his in total four mirrors the telescope can illuminate also the middle infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO-observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
His main mirror mirror is supposed to grasp full 42 meters - and be put from just 1000 mirror elements together.
With pictures people are to calculate, however, in at the earliest 2018.
To 2007 the two saucy-telescopes were regarded as the largest of the world on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea.
You offer now two mirrors with an average each of ten meters.
The saucy-telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-observatory which still looks into the sky next to them with the Subaru-telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, gigantic telescope is supposed to arise - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be marveled at on an illustration.
The space telescope Hubble supplies the most important impressions from the space, however.
Since the 24th April 1990 it supplies already pictures from far worlds.
Since March 2009 the space telescope searches Kepler to extrasolar planets - above all after such that are habitable.
On 2nd February 2011 it was announced by the Nasa that 1235 planetary candidates were traced since mission beginning.
In the picture the last start preparations are documented to Kepler at the space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is fired into the space in at the earliest 2018 on board a Ariane5-missile.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is supposed to search to light of the first stars and galaxies according to the Urknall.
Scientists assume that also at the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are not for that any dependable data since the Messenger circles far nearer at the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have been indicating for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the Messenger-Sonde started in 2004 - the first to circle around the Mercury - the scientists have certainty now.

"Baku became in May famous with the Eurovision song festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the oldest people of the world here," Fatulayeva says".
She is the directress of the museum of longevity, presumably the only one on the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area that shows in an older way than 100th Fatulayeva onto a black on white photo.
That here my grandfather is, he became 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years another child testified
However, the sheep herdsman Şirali Müslümov who is supposed to have become 168 years old is a controversial star of the museum.
There is not a birth certificate, however.
And nevertheless faced with the oldest documented human being to become 122 years old Müslümovs old man appears extremely doubtful.
"In 1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136 years he is supposed to have fathered another daughter.
Did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate therefore with the case of his age around a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max-Planck-institute in Rostock, belonged from the aged ones in Central Asia.
"Becoming noticeable many hochaltrige people gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," Scholz says "also in Sardinia many very old men live extremely".
Because of missing documents no scientific proof is to be led, however, about the age especially as registers of births marriages and deaths were missing.
Every day of cup-wise melted butter
Fact is, however, that the people of the region achieve a biblical age strikingly frequently around Lerik.
At the time of it gives 20 persons that are older than 100 years.
Why live therefore here in the south so much aged?
The aserische guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the special genes of the Talyschen.
Museum directress Fatulayeva believes, that it is due to the feeding.
However that the calorie-rich food is just supposed to be so healthy to the Talyschen that meat, bread and particularly milk products love and from which many drink daily a glass of melted butter, does just not seem plausible either from feeding-scientific view.
Or is it the initial way of life which holds the people in a young way? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement close to the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With their 97 years it is still comparably young for these widths.
Mirzayeva who says to have 143 descendants lives in a simple wooden house which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It is on the ground with a churn, that they tireless hin- und her rollt.
Eight people live here under a roof, under that one of Mirzayevas Söhnen and a daughter, both are for a long time grandparents.
Also two small children jump around.
In the kitchen one prepares tea which is served in the typical, stomach-shaped Armadu-glasses for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in Reih and link, under their head scarf she hides long, dark-blond plaits which their son reveals proudly before us.
I always washed my hairs with milk, so I never ran out of them and they kept their color.
"I have also never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension suffices for the life
She always ate only what came from their own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life long I did not buy food an only time in the supermarket.
Then it tells about their husband who was in the army.
It was worst in the time after the Second World War.
Nevertheless everything became better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the oar.
The propaganda rings strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
Nevertheless the cult which is driven around the father figure of the nation which ruled over his country as a dictator does not know hardly borders in Azerbaijan.
To 2003 it was at the power, later his son Ilham took over the oar.
After all there is not any need among Azerbaijan's old people.
230 manats (about instance the same sum in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as pension, for local relations an amount which one can live from well.
And maybe also Mirzayevas son for a long time turned gray is right: "The old people enjoy respect in our culture."
You live among the major family, love, worries and are happy.
If that is not a reason to stay for so long at the life as possibly
The word "human rights" is missing in the constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep split of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a basis is hard controversial.
The Egyptian president did not economize on pathos.
We must create the crossing.
"And that it succeeds, suits in my responsibility, before the nation and before God", he said in the state television.
His speech was directed onto the whole nation, particularly, however, presumably onto the Christian Copts, the liberals, cleared up Muslims and Secular.
Because they alle, up to now hopelessly zerstritten in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a God state at the Nile of graces of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He has, so Mohammed Mursi, that competences of the constitution court in a temporary way circumcized and that broadens his competences, said almost apologetically "in order to save the revolution".
Nevertheless what the 61-year old engineer really wants to save that takes a doctorate of the American university from south californiums, the Egyptians are about that, the world does completely not realize.
Is the judicial power supposed to be entmachtet?
In fact the 234 articles that were rushed through by the 100-headed Constitution-Giving meeting in an Islamic way dominated there in a nocturnal, 15-hour ride at full speed are partial concern exciting.
As in former constitutions also it is said in the draft the jurisdiction is based on the "principle of Islamic right".
However, what are "principles" called?
That was and is interpretation thing and it stands to fear that the Islamisten will use the spongy formulation and the accompanying juridical elbow room for a more severe interpretation of the sharia.
At least an again led article suggests that: In all matters affecting the sharia the Al-Ashar-Universität must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great ray strength into the entire sunnitischen Islam.
That must not, however it can mean that the clergy supervise the legislation which would result the Entmündigung of the judicial power in the consequence de facto.
Many things in the Verfassunsgsentwurf are interpretation thing
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction is supposed to keep on keeping on being maintained.
These courts were used during Mubaraks domination for the suppression of oppositionist ones.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The state should also, it stands like this in the draft", "the true being of the Egyptian family" protect "and their morality and their values support".
That is juridically so blurredly formulated, that state institutions with the aid of this article could control even the contents of film art and literature.
In the plain text that does not mean anything else than censorship.
No article after all the way the equalization of men and women stipulates expressly.
For that another forbids to offend or to slander the prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
What, however, an insult is and remains as it is supposed to be avenged, unclear.
Just as dubiously the formulation seems, the "insult of people" is prohibited.
Does already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a jurisconsult reach there?
Interpretation thing, as so many things in the draft which there is for Mursi for the signature and which will be presented to "very soon" the Egyptians for the plebiscite according to his words.
"The revolution returned"
The opposition is forming for weeks against the predominance of the Islamisten.
Tens of thousands met in new harmony at the Friday evening on the Tahrir-place in Cairo and still vowed to bring the charter to case before it can come into force.
"The revolution returned and we will triumph", said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of the premiership choices.
Friedensnobelpreisträger and ex-head-boss-chief of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei declared the constitution draft belongs "onto the garbage mountain of the history".
Via brief news item service Twitter he accused the supporters Mursis, to want to lead a "coup d'etat against the democracy".
"If he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and fling it", said the Oppositionelle Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not atoned for yet", the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to control the referendum through which it would become invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well organized Muslim brotherhood sounded the counter-demonstration for her part their part, as a precaution, however, not on the Tahrir place, but according to a mass prayer on the other Nile shore in front of the Kairoer university.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafisten participated in that and called: "The nation demands the application of God's law."
You demanded from Mursi: "The country cleans"! and declared: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty about the symbol-pregnant Tahrir-place on which everything took his beginning would have caused presumably civil war similar states.
Mursis supporters did not want to risk that very obviously.
The Muslim brothers declared both the opponents of the constitution draft and the proponents would have been expressed clearly.
Now the time is to make the nation at the ballot box be decided into which direction the country is supposed to go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamisten is regarded as secure.
"The word human rights comes not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious about this forced constitution process, which actually would have up to February go and be supposed to integrate all social strengths.
The 48-year old human being lawyer and chairpersons of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers, than they were under Mubarak in the prison or in court court stood.
Not because he would split up their philosophy of life, but because for it human rights are indivisible.
For that he was beaten up, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word stands human rights not even in the new constitution", he laments in the conversation with the "world on Sunday".
Mursi Machtausweitung onto all three powers in the state let the attorney give up.
These measures are striking violations of democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of fortifying the civil society, the president sets it de facto out of effect", laments Saeda.
However, without civilian clothes social organizations a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels solely calm, also of the international community that considers the ideological direction fight at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be avenged.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "It gebährt a monster that you cannot control more."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the smelliest fish of the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and that not only in Europe, but on the whole world.
Could putting something with the local appetite onto quite smelly fish have the success secret of the country?
One takes a selection of overripe cheese sorts.
One seats her among a heap of dirty, moist sportswear.
And she leaves a week there.
So approximately one must imagine the nose-deadening odor of Rakfisk, one of the big delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small city of Fagernes, removed by Oslo about three hours.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this stubborn odor in the air that does simply not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is trout strewed salt on, that - dependent on that, how being fed up one would have his fish gladly - up to a year in water is fermented.
If into Norway the darkness about the country comes and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians for a celebration flow here into Fagernes, that this is dedicated, now, really very bribing specialty.
"One eats it rawly and rinses it then with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station, but organizes also the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk-general".
Consume around us around people small fish dies and tall amounts take for this purpose onto alcohol to themselves.
"Like sludges people the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk", Havard says.
The spirit can replace the odor.
I taste some morsels.
If one avoids to bring the Rakfisk into nose proximity, it is not bad - about instance as sushi that has a quite long bus journey behind themselves.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, by far poorer Norwegian epoch than there were not yet any cool possibilities and fish was soaked in the fall in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter it was arrogated then after long Fermentierung and - beyond doubt under senses subdued with the aid of alcohol - is consumed.
Still before a generation thousands of Norwegians were seen forced in search of work, to leave their country and emigrated mainly to the USA.
Today the population increases rapidly - more than 13% are, attracted from a flourishing labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health service, to immigrant.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, that was before not yet far too long time by far richer as Norway, immigrants flow.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - than an essential, when part of the Norwegian history smelling also severely.
He belongs to the more expensive courts which one can buy for oneself here.
However, actually everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not get it often into the world press, and most people seems to disturb that not.
Here one hates still to name Anders Breivik with the case of the name - that racist right extremist that shot 77 men, women and children to death last year.
Instead of this one refers only to the "incident of the 22nd July".
Norwegians are for themselves heavily with accepting that somebody is capable in their peace-loving country for such brutal murders.
The growth of one of the greatest oil and gas industries of the world is Head-Responsible for the present fortune of Norway since the early 1970th years.
"The only reason is not Aber oil why we are so fine", Anna, our waitress, says the distributed round trays with ripe Rakfisk and embodied with their long fair hair and the prickingly blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are - how one says - circumspect nation.
Your English is exactly here immaculate as that of most people.
We are not very boastful, we do not like any pomposity.
Norway dealt with his oil fortune very cautiously - a big part of the branch profits is invested in a special fund for the welfare of future generations.
When in the years up to the world economy crisis all with money around themselves that they did not own at all flung, Norway held his purse shut.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go in the summer rambling, we are happy", says Anna.
"And, she adds "to eat Rakfisk of course" with care free laughter.
I stand in the snow and act for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
Such an Elch-Burger is in any case something else. I like the juicy meat.
But at the evening the being fed up fish stands again on the food plan.
The hotel at which I stay is one of several places of event which organize a Rakfisk-dinner in the case of which guests can vote for the best - or provoking maybe the senses of smell most strongly - fish.
There is a Live-TV-circuit to a show master covered with fly which is surrounded from plates with Rakfisk.
The racket resembles the Eurovision song Contest.
"Which dot number you have there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?
"Here our points, Havard, are".
One claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed from the Aquavit.
However, maybe it is nevertheless the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing himself for his assumption of office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges awaiting him and the mixed feelings of his nation.
The traffic is completely current especially in Mexico City bad.
Even on better days this is an always blocked city, however, on Monday a ring of steel which shuts off several important traffic routes into the capital and guarantees for chaos on the streets was established.
It was not the objective, however, to disturb commuters on the way to the work but to hinder demonstrators at reaching the parliament.
On Saturday Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president bandage and take the leadership of the nation.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the parting government Felipe Calderons Mexico had been able to persist economically well, however, the country is in the grip of a drug war which cost already 60,000 human lives in the last six years.
"My government commits itself strongly to reducing the power", declared Pena Nieto the US American president Barack Obama at the beginning of this week in the oval Office.
I will suggest a new security strategy with which we can reach this objective.
Before it went onto eye level with the US president, Pena Nieto was active as a governor of his home state Mexico.
In this thickly settled, detailed part of the country which surrounds the capital the opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the faraway small town Valle del Bravo one remembers it for example gladly.
Inhabitants of the vacation place ascribe the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure to him.
In order to reach the city, one can go on one of the motorways that made build Pena Nieto and represents the one great improvement opposite the fragile, bumpy streets that there was here once.
Hanging plaques with his name also outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum for the climate change.
"We expect real and continuous changes of it", so his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, that as a congress representative for the party of Pena Nietos, who PRI works.
In particular, what concerns the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years at the power the PRI was dissolved in the year 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congress representative Olvera admits that the party puts great expectations from Los Pinos after 12 years outside of the president palace at Enrique Pena Nieto.
He refuses the reproaches of the opposition the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very much engages and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, particularly he is, however, also somebody who can listen.
But on the other page of the state many people do not divide this opinion about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also confessed as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents a suburb of Mexico City itself in many kinds of respect.
And the problems in the municipality are from decisively urbaner nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was called in in order to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and an especially acute problem is violence against women.
On a spot fallow near a big dump the corpses of dutzender murdered women were let only in the last two years back.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto more than 1,000 women were murdered in the Mexico state - a statistics that surpasses even the one of the city of Ciudad Juarez that is notorious for their power and the murders of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos think that he did not approach the problem of the woman murders adequately during his term of office at least.
However, in the worst case his government shut their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete construction, typical for the quarter come down, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when it shows me photos of their late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events Mariana committed in 2010 suicide.
Nevertheless their family believes that she was murdered by their companion in life.
"When I arrived at her at home, it seemed" remembered to Senora Buendia "as if their body was washed".
It gave to signs that it was beaten, and the rigor mortis had already started.
While their mother is telling their history, a picture looks up from the wall from Mariana down us. It is made next to a cross which carries an only word: Justice.
Nevertheless exactly one refused her these, according to the family, until now.
The authorities treated me as if I a chatterbox, troublemaker, were a complainer.
You would like, that one simply accepts their judgment and keeps quiet.
"But that is not possible if there were so many irregularities and lapses", she says.
If president Pena Nieto obtains the president bandage on Saturday, it takes over also a great responsibility in this way.
Tens of thousands Mexican families were damaged in the last six years of power crimes, and the new president promised to see especially to this problem during his term of office.
I hope, as a president it is like this as he was as a governor" the PRI congress representative Olvera in Valle del Bravo says.
However exactly before that fear the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza the most.
The prosecution claimed: Bradley Manning did not complain about maltreatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Mannings reproaches he was maltreated in the prison
The hearing deals with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense strives for a rejection of the accusation due to too hard custody conditions
The private first class of the US army is reproached to have stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution attempted on Friday to state that the army private first class Bradley Manning - accused for the greatest disclosure of confidential information of the US American history - missed several occasions to complain about the maltreatment supposedly suffered by him in military custody.
With the case of a cross-examinaton of Mannings during a vorgerichtlichen hearing in Ft. Meade, Maj declared to Maryland. Ashden Fein, that documents to weekly visits, that prison officials during Mannings of nine month long custody time in Quantico had carried out, Virginia, no complaints about his treatment showed.
Manning had stated a day in front of the cross-examinaton that was kept off due to a request of the defense for the rejection of the accusation - Manning was punished through the hard custody time already sufficiently -, he would have considered that one in the prison suicide.
To the secret service analyst the US army that was arrested in June 2010 is reproached to have stolen thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was published then by WikiLeaks in the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as sources of the information.
In the hearing on Friday passed with Manning the forms, the Beamte after their meetings with Manning during his custody in the Quantico military prison had filled, where it had of July 2010 to April 2011 under increasing custody conditions resident.
The officials set Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When refine it on Friday to the forms questioned, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment as "very professional" in total through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment through the equipment.
The forms, so refine, no complaints contained about maltreatment although the officials Manning directly for his treatment had consulted.
Manning answered, it expressed his objections verbally and the officials would have cured these with him and would have declared to deal with these. They were not taken down, however.
"You did not write down (after discussion of the objections) Any problems, and that did not mean necessarily that I said nothing at all" so Manning.
The judge, colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met in January 2011 a committee which should examine the suicide thoughts mentioned by him some months before on a form.
Manning answered, his intention during this meeting consisted in making step his observation status for the "prevention of injuries".
The military testified, assigned this restrictive status - that a stage stands under the suicide danger - to his and the protection of others to him.
"I wanted to convince employees of my being fine, and rid myself of the observation status for the prevention of injuries (...) being able to achieve about a living quality higher from my view" said Manning.
Manning testified on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where it was held approximately two months, before it was moved to the prison of the marine basis Quantico in July 2010 in Virginia.
He said in Kuwait he considered the suicide and became once unconscious due to the heat.
Not to be allowed to know what with it or in the outside world happens was burdening.
"My world shrank on camp Arafjon, onto this cage", Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
When it was brought out according to Quantico, Manning spent the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
One allowed him only a mattress, a cover, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he attempted to stay in motion, because on day it was prohibited to sleep or only also to lie down.
Always he had had to sleep with light which penetrated his cell from outside.
If it turned itself round at night and guards could not see his face anymore, one woke him up so that he turns himself down again.
In January 2011 Mannings attorney raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning into the military prison of fort Leavenworth became, Kansas brings out.
On Friday the judge Manning also for an accusation that it had raised in his statement on Thursday consulted - so he had had to sleep a night nakedly in his cell in Quantico and stand with the case of a morgendlichen counting nakedly before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had stated he has never had during this counting the occasion to cover oneself with his cover.
During the questioning on Friday Manning indicated he concluded from a command of his guard that he should make the cover which it could have covered itself with fall. He admitted, however, that nobody had called him for that.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he was forced in the previous night to sleep nakedly. He would have attempted before to show an official that it does not represent any danger for itself.
Manning said to the official, he could have used the Federal Government of his pants or his flip-flops in order to hurt oneself, does this, however.
In this night, so Manning testified, his pants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His attorneys hope for the judge considering his custody experiences at least and reducing his custody measure drastically, if he should be condemned during his negotiations in front of the military court. This is applied for beginning of next year.
The defense served, that Manning will confess smaller offenses' for guilty, while other charges that are regarded as too extreme are being supposed to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. A justification of the custody conditions is expected by the prosecution.
The pentagon remains with the case of his position, that according to Manning the regulations' was hung on, that are valid for all prisoners verwahrten under the highest safety measures in Quantico.
To the charges against Manning belong the preferential treatment of the enemy, illegal publication of secret-official information in the Internet, the transfer of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
He becomes in all charges for guiltily been, a lifelong prison sentence threatens it.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the missing chances forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to accusing the emigrants - hard times call it to them into the memory, he says
Navarrette thinks that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico City I had just crossed first the hall and had arrived at the passport check when desperation spread in me.
Signs referred to two queues: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigner").
I stood some seconds long there, unsure to which one I should go.
I grew up in central californiums and my whole life was mentioned long "Mexican".
An ethnic abbreviation - just the same, as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italian" name themselves.
Later I decided for "Mexikanisch-Amerikanisch".
However that was here Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather there was not any need to abbreviations or hyphens.
I was simple only American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough, in order to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I do also not rid myself of my American accent.
Therefore I took my American passport and positioned myself into the snake for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week, when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto went to the White House, in order to meet president Obama.
On the agenda all those topics which one expects stood if the heads of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
It was interested to Pena Nieto also very much at that to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans staying nowadays in Mexico with just as high probability instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American commercial block according to model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels even if he did not name any details concerning that.
Mexico's relation to the United States is complicated and full resentment.
Most Americans never waste presumably an only thought of the United States collapsing into Mexico in the year 1848 and forcing the leadership of the country under rifle held up to leaving more to them than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as therefore a US Regierungsbeamter practices also only mildest criticism at Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country - complaints besetting the sovereignty of their neighbor country as the Americans about that.
And the children Montezumas go onto the warpath.
And nevertheless the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth suits to Mexican Americans who live in the United States in the relationship with the more than 35 million.
Inclination to talk about resentments?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winner and loser. People who the country offers chances for, and others which it does not do this for.
The only reason, why as many people of Mexican origin in cities as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, phoenix, Denver or San Antonio live, exists in at a point in our pedigree a person - maybe a parent or grandparents part - not getting any chance offered in Mexico and north migrating in the direction.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, and so forth.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faith is meant for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live the American dream maybe now, have attended good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose from the eyes, that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity became blurred sometimes possibly, but what concerns our loyalty, is not this the case.
This means for the United States unequivocally.
In addition we are conscious that many members of the Mexican leadership shift do not like us to ourselves.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish is never never good enough our bands to Mexico strong enough.
In your opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves now caught behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, however, nevertheless somehow lost.
My wife that was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States as a child legally reminds me of between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions existing because Mexicans have a clearer idea above that who they are - and Mexican Americans are offended this at them.
While she is being a US American citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.
Nevertheless many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling on the one hand yet neither not to belong to the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best thing of both worlds, nevertheless did not root in any of them.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something, which makes this relationship even more complicated: Some Mexican leadership persons and parts of the education bourgeoisie would like to resume their connections to the diaspora.
Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" who represent their interests in the United States want to use them for Mexico.
We are supposed to tell our American colleagues about that, as fabulously a visit of this country is and pressure on the political leadership exert, to intensify their links to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And faced with the unfair income distribution, the unrestrained corruption and the drug power many of us are not so secure at all, whether it is really a question of a fabulous country.
I fear, there must their only through, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the contact with Mexico one and a half centuries ago yet, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold a grudge for that as their member of the family only before not at all so long time were treated.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are "more Mexican" than I thought.
Old combats, new Near east
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove to be unexpected keystone for the peace
Can there be ever continuous peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem such hope in the germ to suffocate.
Among the usual fault assignments countless buildings were put into debris and ash, more than 140 Palestinians, civilians, and six Israelis killed most from that - and for the first time missiles struck from Gaza near the Israeli Tel Aviv metropolis and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historical conflict, the Near east changes around them around.
The Arabian spring created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis became part of these disorders.
Maybe this will lead only to more bloodsheds.
However, there are reasons for the assumption that the fatal stalemate situation could find their end at last.
A war, which neither did not lose still is won
At first sight optimism seems all but made faced with the current situation.
Even if that one agreed on 21st November armistice stops, the dieswöchigen fights fortified the hard-boiled ones on both pages.
The chiefs of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will say from themselves to have pushed the Israelis back although his grouping itself had to record great losses.
Although several Hamas-Führer are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip penned in in one of the corners of the planet most desolate and thickly most populated, Israel did not succeed until now in destroying the Hamas.
In fact the Hamas wins in the West Bank, that of the rival one, moderate Palestinian group Fatah is controlled.
And that to Hamas-Führer could come to the end, that they have the time on their page.
The way Islamisten gained influence in the Arabian world the Hamas had been able to pull powerful and rich friends onto their page.
Turkey, a power being strengthened again, regional that once was regarded as Israel's narrowest Muslim ally took for the Hamas party - exactly as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf State.
Jubilant Hamas-Anhänger believe that an Islamic half-moon forms itself around Israel - of Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has the power, above Syria, where rebels of an increasingly islamistischeren coining could be before the Stürzung Bashar Assads, up to Jordan, where Hamas-Verbündete threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the Arabian country inhabitant-strongest with distance and most important - at the southern flank of Israel changed the balance of the region lastingly.
Hosni Mubarak, the laizistische despot that ruled over Egypt up to his fall 2011 for 30 years had only little time for the Hamas remaining.
In contrast the brotherhood is verschwägert with the Hamas and their chiefs stronger dependent on nation opinions.
In the case of future diplomatic negotiations the Hamas could prove to be protagonist that cannot be herausgedrängt even by Israel and the United States.
On the other hand let to the Israeli hardliners draw an opposite conclusion.
The Hamas is seen military no danger anymore.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", had been able to persist and many of the Hamas-Raketen were destroyed.
At least a while long Israel will be able to sleep more quietly.
In diplomatic respect the United States hold on unshakeably to their position. Many European countries made the Hamas responsible for the newest power escalations.
Israel did well in last years, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu who ignored the peace process to big parts.
Although missiles killed about 30 Israelis from the Gaza stripe since 2004, the country remained relative freely from suicide assassins - last but not least thanks to the blocking-installations, that run into the West Bank and in this way into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements which were declared indeed as international law adverse, yet are extended always further.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud-party allied with an even more combative group in the front end of the choices on the 22nd January under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why also these crafty Palestinians pamper and leave an own state with them?
If in fact they had the control of the West Bank, they would not fire off then also missiles exactly as their combatants in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better, to hold behind the wall in chess and to punish they, they should dare to lift the heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to assert. Nevertheless the Arabian spring could make them a line through the bill.
Self when the Islamisten that now are in Egypt and in other countries at the power have little remaining for Israel, they will concentrate first of all on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense appropriation of Israel is greater together than that of his four Arabian neighbors is.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arabian governments during the repair of their economy.
That the pragmatic president Mursi put together with Barack Obama in order to achieve an armistice could be a promising sign - and symbolize maybe the beginning of a new era.
Also Israelis should think more on a long-term basis.
While the remaining Arabian world is doing timid steps in the direction of democratization, Palestinians keep on being robbed of their self-determination right - a powder keg that will explode beyond doubt one day in the in an Israeli manner busy fields exactly as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The suppression untergräbt already now the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arabian population this situation will only intensify.
Bloody missions to the Zurückdrängung of the Hamas in the Gaza-stripe will require their diplomatic toll increasingly over the years.
Both pages require an impulse from outside
The correct answer is that, that of the more reasonable representatives of both pages, the majority of the remaining world and of this newspaper will represent: Two states near which Israel to security purposes hands over fields.
The - for the near future small - hope consists in the armistice giving external more influence for the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now the arm deliveries together with Turkey and Qatar in the Gaza patrols and is better positioned than ever before, around the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, complemented with field exchange and a common Jerusalem, to convince.
External Arabian nations should convince also the Hamas and Fatah of an agreement.
In this way would be done for the creation of a Palestinian state more than with the imminent request for UN observer statuses.
Also Obama must contribute his part to convincing Israel of negotiations.
During his first term of office he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems far remote in the White House as if it were averse to a participation in the same way.
However, that is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States have an essential interest at a stable Near east.
And a peace agreement belongs to that between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for homogeneous cigarette packagings come into force
Health warnings and sick parts of the body on neutral green packages that are identical for all tobacco brands
The worldwide first laws came for homogeneous cigarette and tobacco packagings into force in Australia. In this way brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive-green lids that in addition are printed with drastic pictures that show sick parts of the body and babies sick through cigarette smoke and children.
From the different health warnings and pictures once foreseen the only difference consists from coming Saturday between the packages in the brand names that are printed in identical, small writing.
In this way Australia introduces the worldwide most severe regulations for tobacco packagings.
The Australian Federal Government wants to talk out young people of the smoking when the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is removed.
The government takes as a basis studies that showed that people, that with 26 still not have started smoking with 99%-iger probability also after that no more will begin.
"One can see already with children of young age that they understand the message the tobacco company groups with their brand picture apply attempt", according to federal minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies which for example showed that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the least smoker rates of the world and the changes will affect the profits of the multinational company groups only insignificantly, other countries consider already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought in a hard way against the laws.
So it was said with the laws the black market trade would be favored, what too cheaper and easy accessible cigarettes leads.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintentional consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian forgers will offer by far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Say others on the other hand that the laws stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, says, that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to the covering of the intolerable packagings have gone up enormous, since the company groups British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the uppermost Australian court of justice failed with their contestation of the laws.
Zico sold wholesale businesses up to 6,000 units and waits for new supplies.
For us that is a good business.
According to experts the hook is in the popularity of social media near exactly the population group which the plan consults.
Tabakkonzerne banished a series of Australian laws from the TV advertising, forbidden it to them, as sport sponsors occur and most traders in order not to design cigarettes longer in businesses forced. Now the tobacco advertising is changed into the Internet.
The Australian government forbade internet advertising through local enterprises and pages, does not have, however, any influence on international pages.
"Who commercializes tobacco and has only a small field remaining, to apply around his products, does not get about around the Internet", Becky Freeman, researcher, says in the health service at the Sydney university.
On social media as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman found a rise at field reports to brands that were written by "very normal people".
One must ask oneself the question: That is only a private person that thinks so great favor of Marlboro cigarettes that she receives even a video for that - or a marketing agency in this way has to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says, that the industry instead of on marketing on that concentrates, to deal with the new laws.
It went even so far, to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in order to contest the new regulations - those countries complain with the case of the world trade organization about unfair commercial restrictions although no one of the countries runs greater trade with Australia.
A WTO-decision is expected for middle in 2013.
According to Plibersek the government led conversations with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was in 2001 the first country to stipulate photographic warnings.
In the meantime these onto more than 40 countries were expanded, under that Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves defiantly.
The pictures do not influence me.
I simply ignore it.
"One simply takes an edge and puts the box away", says Victor El Hage during the purchase of a cigarette packet, on whom a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly said it gives only a reason why I would stop, and that is my small girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says the homogeneous packaging complicated the filling up of his shelves.
"Formerly I needed an hour in order to sort a delivery, now I need four", Yu says.
"The government should simply completely have forbidden cigarettes - then we would have said ourselves okay, that was it, we make thick, he matches visibly infuriates in addition".
In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be also once bored
I spent this Thanksgiving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, than our airplane due to mechanical problems turned out and we had to wait for another airman.
I had therefore enough time in order to do me a few thoughts to boredom.
I do not want to lie.
To wait for a flight half a day at the airport is quite nerve-killing - self, if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
However always more academics and child development experts mention boredom than something positive.
If it works after them, it is okay for us - and our child - to be sometimes bored.
In this way the brain is forced to be lost in interesting trains of thought which supports the creativity possibly.
And because most of us nowadays almost constant onto that one one or stare other screen, the advantages of the boredom do not benefit us anymore.
Should we welcome the boredom therefore with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I come to that once again back.
As many people also I assumed always boredom being a relatively current phenomenon which developed with advancing leisure time.
However, Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see that like this.
"In fact the boredom has a very long history", he says.
A roman graffiti above boredom which goes back to the first century adorns the house walls Pompejis.
And then still the question is there how we define boredom actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the university York in Ontario, according to Canada the problem consists in boredom defining in all sorts of ways and being discussed.
After long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 persons professor Eastwood and his colleagues to the conclusion came, that boredom as the experience, "to want to carry out a satisfactory activity, this, however, not can" can define.
Boredom is distinguished from apathy accordingly in such a way that the person is not busy, would like to be this, however.
With the case of the apathy on the other hand it gives no urge, to do something.
He says, the key experience of the boredom, consists in a "trouble of the attention process, combined with bad mood and the feeling that the time goes by only slowly."
Boredom can almost sound in this way so as depression can.
But professor Eastwood believes, although these two states could be related, bored persons see the problem in their surroundings or the world while depressive persons are seeing the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that concentrating is boring to us even if we only have difficulties.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in term of Attention "- to German about instance: "The inactive intelligence: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention", which appeared in September in the technical journal paper "Perspectives on Psychological Science", professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to a former experiment there, with the participant a volume listened, on which a person read out a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud channel program from the adjacent room which doing did not have anything with the contents. Others heard it on low volume so that it was hardly perceptible while the third group was not vernahm these noises at all.
The persons that did not vernahmen the hardly audible television declared to verspüren more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, could not find any reason for these and ascribed their difficulties to the boredom.
If one attempts to concentrate on a difficult or hard task, the trouble of the attention can lead to boredom, says J. Fenske, associated professor for neurosciences at the university Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study, to marks.
When one on the other hand a monotonous activity carried out - "so as the search for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can turn away and help with not "feeling" bored".
Actual, so he says, we know now, that these can even oppose Herumzappeln and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign for boredom, when persons remain physically more attentive.
"Studies showed, that learn children that may jump about more and keep more information than those ones that are forced to the Stillsitzen" so professor Fenske.
To us all becomes sometime once boring - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, an especially tiring film.
But some persons are bored more easily than others are.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980th years a "scale into the boredom delicateness".
On the scale statements as "Many things that I must do" are found "repeat and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything".
With the aid of such scales researchers found out that to boys becomes more often boring than girls so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the west Florida university - in particular, what affects the need according to more and a greater variety of external charms.
However, in general teenagers are a quite measured heap.
Reed Larson carried on in the year 1991, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment, at which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a beeper.
He found the way out, that 32% the watching-sending in the school and while finishing the homework were bored, wohingegen 23% indicated, bored to be if they were not in the school.
However only 3% of the parents declared to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages increased with regard to the boredom or sank.
He is, however, secure that the youth is felt as especially boring, main, because children and teenagers do not have any great influence on their everyday life course.
Back therefore for my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because at the very most it leads to that that people take extreme physical risks onto themselves and succumb to the gambling or to drugs in order to ease it - studies showed that.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion professor Vodanovich that is investigating the topic for more than two decades is.
"With the boredom it wants to tell one the brain that one should do something else", according to Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the New York university.
But the brain does not know always, what one should just do best.
When one boring is and used one this energy in order to play Gitarre and to cook, one becomes happy.
However, television can guarantee at short notice indeed for happiness, these evaporate on a long-term basis but again.
It can talk out who gives an iPad to his bored child therefore indeed of the boredom in this way. It has in this way yet not learned to maintain or to control oneself, professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "Self-control spreads from a situation to the other one".
The child does only not learn to talk, but he receives more self-control also in other fields.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it too critical.
Instead of this our objective should consist in feeling well also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees to that.
"It rings as if have to be to us more often boring. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant wish, to do something reasonable", it says.
He believes that the people in truth seek only to a way to switch off and to relax.
"In some surroundings in which we are stimulated constantly it is difficult to occupy oneself if the noise has stopped once."
In Colorado there is not any clear guideline for the new marihuana law
The 19-year old Community College-Student and soccer player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorados for an offense that will already soon be legal in this state in court court: The possession of of a few marihuana pieces and a whistle with which it smoked these.
According to Orozco it and some friends were on a September day by car, when they were stopped, in Lamar near the border to Kansas on the way.
After the police officer had found marihuana in the car, Orozco was summonsed for the possession from drugs and drug utensils - peccadillos which are equipped with a punishment of 100 United States dollars in each case - and received a court hearing.
"We" are "treated" as criminals", according to Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small amounts marihuana for the own use to legalize, the answer shakes off less of the law at hundreds of smaller drug offenses, than from the location.
Hundreds of infractions of the law that turn around marihuana become Washington here and in the state, who approved similar measures, already trap-calm.
The police do not follow adults because of possession longer over 21 years in small measure. This is allowed by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next weeks.
But public prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados announced, to weiterverfolgen existing marihuana offenses and people summon still in court court.
At the same time several cities vote, from the suburbs of Denver above to the western Mountains above that, to hinder licensed new, state marihuana businesses at the opening in their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know at all what will happen as next", Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, says that lies east of Denver.
And also regulation authorities in the Washington Federal state scratch themselves helplessly at the head.
You wait for a guideline to the equipment of a license system for the production, production, the marketing and the sale of the drug - and have in this case a period of time up to the 1st December 2013 in front of eyes.
In Washington one thinks that Colorado is ahead of most states in every case what affects the regulation of marihuana. There the drug first to medical purposes and then for the own consumption was legalized.
"Colorado has a more strongly adjusted market. The state is suitable for the orientation well therefore", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the inspectorate, for spirits in the Washington state.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than to be used in the sense of a coarse guide.
"We do not have any real precedent which we can follow" he adds.
The Washington law, mentionedly I-502, comes into force on 6th December and forms in this way also the endpoint of a grey zone in which indeed yet the state license system does not exist, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about instance, as the state handicap of an "adequate access" to licensed marihuana with the prohibition of cannabis businesses within a radius of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities is supposed to be agreed.
"Nowhere it will not be heavier, to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in town areas, in particular in the conurbation of Seattle", Ben Livingston, speaker for the "center for Legal of Cannabis", means a recently formed team of researchers.
On 21st November Chief Oates sent his employees an E-Mail in which it declared the public prosecutor would not pursue smaller marihuana offenses longer with persons above 21 years into Aurora and that the police "immediately now on" will not strive for any charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police will keep on putting through urban handicaps for the regulation of peasants of medical marihuana and drug traders would keep on being followed.
In Weld County in the north Colorados district public prosecutor Ken Buck represents a more severe opinion.
After the vote it indicated his authority would keep on pursuing cases of marihuana possession main, in order to move consumers for the revocation.
Currently 119 persons must justify themselves for the possession of about 50 grams or less marihuana court court although many were accused also for other offenses.
"Our authority pursued the duty violations with the case of which it was" a question "of crimes" to the action time" Buck could be announced in a declaration.
The reactions are conflicting even at places as the rural mesa county, where voters refused the marihuana-initiative.
The police in gravel Junction, the biggest city of the rural district, do not announce adults longer for the possession of smaller amounts.
This decision supported district public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger, decided, however, also on that, not fall all outstanding possession procedures to let.
"I do not believe that I waste my time with putting through the right until it is changed", he says.
Although 55% of the voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was already from the beginning clear that it would not be simple to agree the personal consumption of marihuana with the complexities of government and judicial system.
And the inconsistent reactions in the whole state supported a far-reaching conflict among local officials with regard to the great green experiment to light.
With district public prosecutors it is a question of a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver that represents for marihuana offenses defendants standing in court court and acts on site as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of marihuana laws.
"You transferred a so big part of their life with following persons legally because of their not still being able to accept the legalization", he believes.
As first states, Mix the smaller one marihuana as to handle alcohol, Colorado and Washington as national pattern cases for the legalization of drugs are sold.
While intercessors and civil servants are preparing themselves for an age of legal sale, they wait simultaneously also nervously for instructions of the Federal Government which keeps on wanting to treat the sale and the building of marihuana on federal level as a crime.
Intercessors of the legalization movement hope for the Ministry of Justice giving in.
In spite of several sensational arrests of consumers and sales assistants of medical marihuana the Federal Government allowed the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug politics consultant of the Obama government thinks that detectives will probably indeed not kick in any doors, will presumably bristle, in order to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, however, to allow the marihuana businesses legal under the new legislation, from a government viewpoint adjusted.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait first at all for the federal authorities acting.
Still before the choice day some local local administrations approved moratoriums for new marihuana-businesses although these could not open before in about instance a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six month long prohibition which is presumably adopted next week.
"We would not like to get into a position with the case of which we license somebody and "stand then on federal level" before a great problem", according to Bob Nicholson, member of the town council councillor.
Our municipality voted against this law change.
We straighten, for which the municipality decided and not after what the state decided for.
Nor many questions are not open.
Petronella Wyatt: I became from Oxford gemobbt because I am a Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their opinions
Always it had been my greatest dream to receive a place at the Oxford university.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I held for the biggest knowledge temple of the world once for a modern Greek symposium, that supported the big columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks after my entry in the Worscester college end of the eighties - there I had planned to study history - I had packed again my suitcases and caused so the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said I would have gone because I had had a problem in this way that fellow students had sex in the adjacent room.
The author A N Wilson declared mischievously I would have left the university because I was forced to that, to drink from damaged cups.
The truth, however, was less amusing.
I ran away.
Ran, because I suffered from systematic Mobbing and threats.
Not about instance due to my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had harassed me only for a reason - a reason, that in this alleged cradle of the illumination the more narrow-minded and crueler shone: My in the meantime late father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I proponent of the Conservative Party.
Why mentions I this just now?
Now, according to current reports a new generation of students of the moderate ones suffers Dispute under similar pursuit.
The organized and increasing hatred for Tory students in Oxford developed in the meantime such dimensions that a group demanded the same equal rights protection from them last week the gays', disabled persons and ethnic minorities benefits.
Conservative members of the junior Common Room (JCR) the corpus Christi College serve, they are "often isolated due to their political opinions actively ", personally attacked and declared as unwanted".
You demand a place in the equal rights committee of their college in order to guarantee that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation through a recently broadcast documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland", was Verschlimmert: Young, Bright and on the Right" that represented Tories as Exzentriker and neo-Nazis.
In that graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative studentischen union of the Oxford university, who went in a Rolls-Royce and showed off with silvery suit and silver-busy going-stick was shown among other things.
At other universities conservative students say they are considered as "Scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year long hatch Black, vice-president of the conservative student union of the Nottingham university, made in a Sunday newspaper be reported: "There is a wachsende link tendency at universities.
The people believe, we are as the Bullingdon Club without having become acquainted with us anyway".
Samuel Roberts, 21 and history student in corpus Christi that initiated the request for bigger protection thinks such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative studentischen union of Oxford says, she observed a wachsende refusal with JCR members opposite students of the moderate ones Dispute.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the good health of the members" she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
When incredibly shy 18-year I was arrived in September 1986.
The Hatred for the Conservative Party had reached his climax.
In the previous year the university had voted for not giving Margaret Thatcher - a former student - any honorary title due to shortenings in the college being.
The atmosphere would have made even Stalinists be startled.
In the first days of the Erstsemester-week at which new students become acquainted with themselves and the tutors I received a foretaste of the future events.
I had the experience, that the tutors did only not tolerate the mocking of Tory students, but participated in that even with joys.
Political topics as the miner strike, the denationalization and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid-regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I should translate French texts from the 18th century in the English. Onto what then should come, I had not been grabbed.
"Miss "you translate the first sale" to Wyatt", the tutor Harry Pitt (in the meantime late) said, "please".
I stumbled in this case.
Pitt was a small man with a face as from cake mixture, and quite spiteful.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or they are only simple stupid"? he asked to me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears boiled up.
"I suggest that they take in your leisure time of a few French hours - therefore if you are" not "occupied with your social activities too very much" Pitt growled at me.
I returned with hanging head to my room.
At this evening I had the supper in the college alone, than me easily for somebody onto the shoulder bet.
An English student was from the second year by the name of James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative studentischen union.
"I know who you are", he said in a friendly manner.
Unfortunately it is how it is.
To be to everyone that is suspected Tory is bullied.
For me it is already bad enough, but she will know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore it will be worse for you.
Most Tory-Erstsemester pretend to be supporters of the Labour-party.
In a local pub I attempted later to act.
I insisted, that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
An university entrant in the compartment of philosophy, politics and economy, that ironischerweise that than conservatively valid Eton College had visited, said to me: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You dirtied.
Other students divided his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"As Tories have sex"? one asked to me.
Those ones beat themselves mutually, or?
I felt like this as homosexuals had to have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever succeed in leading a normal life at the Oxford university?
Could I meet like-minded persons only after dark?
Should I to turn to the Labour-party and to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years which lay before me stretched themselves before my intellectual eye for a purgatory of the ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who gave to recognize oneself as a Tory openly was Norman Stone, professor, for contemporary history which had his seat in my college.
It was not hated only for being a conservative but also, because he had advised Thatcher as regards foreign policy and written speeches for them.
It was only rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-check and refused it for his Marxist-deterministic history perspective.
In 1997 he picked up a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not become happy here", he said to me.
I began, to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and refuge found with friends opened up and member of the family in the city.
I told my father, that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
It seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the forties all political opinions were accepted.
"But it is the best place on the world", he said subduedly.
They would never do something like that, not in my city of the dreaming steeples.
Even my communist friends put always flawless manners on the day.
His moist eyes obscured.
Give a chance to the whole.
I am secure, one only teases you.
It would break me the heart if you went.
My emotional resistance was exhausted by my frequent journeys to London more weakly.
One of my masculine friends, also Tory-Anhänger, had given in to the pressure and renounced from his convictions.
During a tutorial in the following week with the case of which a further history tutor had said seriously I am "an enemy of the nation" I decided on doing the same one.
In spite of my overcoming with shame secretly, I admitted that my parents had subjected me to a "brainwashing", and she named "old idiots".
The relief lasted only shortly.
It was my father who beat the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford-career.
At that time he wrote weekly two columns in the Murdoch-press.
My door was shut.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my bloodhounds gave up.
When they went, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Gladly you can mention me a tearful wimp.
But none 18-year should have to suffer ever from such intimidation and evil-mindedness in an educational facility institution.
And it is even more tragic that it was Oxford - a university that did not produce only 14 Tory prime ministers, but hides until today behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought.
"Valentino draws elegance of the celebrity before"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of the couture" that was opened this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker speaks.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the single place in the British capital which is worthy of the Beherbergung of an exhibition above Valentino Garavani.
The designer during the opening of "Valentino" has this "-" acknowledged "of master of the couture", an overwhelming retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of the Haute couture were put together that were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the end of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani which, however, could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino verspürte always already fascination for the stuffy and far world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition that will be to be seen still up to the 3rd March there is a great number at private letters and photos with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, begun by the princess Salimah Aga khan, about the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England up to lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise of the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
To be amorous into the nobility does not have to be from disadvantage.
"At least they do not stamp out their edges on your marvellous carpet as it some beautiful celebrities put from the pop music", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60th and 70th years the two lived in the alps and good friends were.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We all were pleased if we were invited to his house in Gstaad", the exwoman of "Heini" Thyssen declares, in a close way with forgotten beauties as to B. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino preferred always already the elegance of the celebrity.
And nevertheless he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago we went into Rome to it home for the supper according to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna.
We were about 20 persons, under that also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Recognized by every detail of his apartment, the decoration, at the food and at the music and one sensed his influence.
"All invited felt important and loved", the "top model" remembers that began their career at the week of the Haute couture in 1995 in Paris.
"It never comes from the fashion, because his designs works of art are" she says definitively..
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of keenness, rather of mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was changed into a catwalk glorious and 60 meters long which suggests a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk in order to admire a marvellous "audience" that takes masterpieces from Valentino how for example the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for their wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti bore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonged, the the empress Farah Diba.
In this public from dummies names as that one shine from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria of Thurn and taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the fashion maker, 2006
Saying a lot of of these customers which is first Valentino as the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember still perfectly.
It was some trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the fall/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a present of it", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I would accuse him of all other because of his great love for the women and because he emphasizes our beauty, before" the ex-duchess matches from Feria.
I like the colors which he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The first time cannot forget also the princess and opinion guide with the case of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg when it supported a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed about having the age and the occasion to bear one of his evening dresses at last...
Finally at the end of the nineties it was added then.
I bought my first Valentino dress for myself for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, that prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper part with a neckline which does honor to his name.
"It was a truly become dream", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless", this Italian aristocrat that lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires explains.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps their evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress but also the memories combined with that".
The "king" of the fashion
The great final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker mentioned his sewers) were necessary in order to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a tail four and a half meters long.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the uppermost authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the uppermost society".
For years with that "savoir-être" obscured to the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Orders the Arts et of the Lettres, marked with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.
"His well-kept and perfect outside appearance struck me always his cunning, his rest," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw it the last time a month ago at a gala dress supper in the museum de Orsay.
He was at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"It was immaculate; the time does not leave behind any tracks at it".
And a princess says this...
The most difficult profession of the world: the human sloggers of Kawah Ijen
For four euros the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health if they take 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, stony ways.
There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others work in a word for word way in the hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn themselves their life who getting sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian Java island.
For this purpose it must climb down every day the ground of his crater, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing out of the earth hardens in the contact with the air.
After it has lacked big sulphur stones, be able to weigh the up to in total 70 kilos, it transports it over the sloping paths in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders of stone.
It is indeed only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that rises until a height from 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle speed, at which they keep the balance and their steps cautious have to put so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that every step can cost their life as this of a French tourist who fell before years at the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen passed.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur which they remove.
Above arrived, they would clear the way between the tourists, that they as circus monkeys photograph and walk with the baskets in a tiring way heavy three kilometers up to the scales that a mine society set up below on a height of 1850 meters a little bit further
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, that since 1960 the occurrences in the volcano uses and (never better said) his workers, to whom she pays 662 Indonesian Rupien (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.
She sells that then for each 10,000 Rupien (83 euro cents) onto the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and for the production of matches, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the bleaching of sugar is used.
"Since we usually bear 70 kg, we receive for every way of about 46,000 Rupien (3.8 euros)", Anto that normally does three stretches on day declares us.
He needs three hours after which it is completely created for every stretch, at the end of the day he has, however, then 138,000 Rupien (11.5 euros) together.
What as a miserable wage for one such an almost inhuman effort looks is, however, the triple thing of what he would earn with the work in the fields.
"The day's pay of the mine workers here is where with the case of the coffee harvest of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) on day pay and the average month income is two million Rupien (167 euros) very high", the carrier explains that before worked as a bricklayer on the touristischen Bali island.
There he earned 75,000 Rupien (6.2 euros) from the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near, and that for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduisten, and I brought it to Java in order to convert it for the Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
The 27 yearly Anto puts for three years his life at the Kawah Ijen onto the game, whose sulphur at the it already the first tracks has left behind, although it covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price which he must pay for the attaining of his dream.
"I will work here still two years because I would like to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in one more than only acceptable English's.
This young man agreeable and intelligent, but punished from the life could work than tourist leaders, waiter or at the reception of a hotel however instead of this he performs the work of a carrying-donkey.
He splits himself up a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, where his characteristic yellow color shines in the darkness bluish, because the sulphur flows out also at night.
The shadows provoking, it climbs in the light of a small helmet lamp at his helmet that he bought from his own money, into the crater.
About 400 carriers load themselves the baskets with sulphur onto their shoulders at the crater ground.
In spite of their great profits the mine society did not mechanize the sulphur disassembly in order to save costs and provides the carriers, that work onto own bill and be paid to weight, no outfit.
You do not keep also any part of the 30,000 Rupien (2.5 euros) for Zuschlag per camera which the guardians of this nature park demand together with the admission at the level of 15,000 Rupien (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to the photographing of the volcano and the human carrying-donkeys.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human being" Madrusin, a carrier stocky, 42 years old, of the three decades protests since abandonment of the school works at the Kawah Ijen.
It is in the situation, to support up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it works" because he needs the money for the education of his three children in the age between 10 and 18 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind turns suddenly and clamps the mine workers in the thick columns that climb up from the crater, the men are so hard, that nobody complains about difficult illnesses... natural except for the usual breath problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back Unainik with his 53 years is only in the situation to bear 50 kg.
Every day it and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, that of three LKWs about a goat path between the shrubbery to the warehouse in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance are transported.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano my whole life was" Unainik declares at which it opens his mouth in which some teeth are missing far.
From his five children the oldest with his 30 years works also as a sulphur-carrier.
The time goes by, but the miserableness stops generation on generation in one of the hardest professions of the world: that of those ones who work as human load donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to the rescue of the economy
The Singaporeans shift the fault onto the career, the stress and the costs of the immovables and the infant education for their not having any children.
"The population of Singapore must increase."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: Let's fulfill our civic duty and let's create lives!
It seems unplausible that the verses are part of an advertising for mint candies, but nevertheless - or just therefore - they became a viral video at the beginning of this year in Singapore on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, that local sayings as e.g. "shift" does "one "bao" (Loaf) into the stove" in order about the low birth rate in Singapore merry.
The advertising-company BBH that turned the video preserves the hope that the advertising spot reaches in merry way onto the problem attentively do.
Your creative conductor Douglas Hamilton say, that he wanted to use the power of the music to bringing the people to that, fulfill their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, therefore we had to design it merrily and wittily.
It is a question of the greatest problem in this country.
While propagating we are the worst of the world, therefore we noticed that it is a question of a topic which we had to see to.
We knew that the government had attempted many things as e.g. the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of Speed-Dating-evenings (fast flirts).
Possible, that many of these ideas were creative, they did not lead, however, to the success compellingly.
Therefore we thought: Why do we not make something as creative as possible in order to approach this problem how to compose e.g. a rap?
1.2 children
Who does not take this topic easy is the government of Singapore.
Every year she spends 1,300 United States dollars for political measures in order to incite the citizens to get more children.
Kind gives a parcel of the government for married couples and parents up to 15,000 dollars, prolongs the motherhood vacation and distributes tax advantages.
But everything had little success up to now.
Singapore is a rich, highly-technological city state in the southeast of Asia which is known also to the conservatism of his ruling and his strict social controls.
According to his national population authority the birth rate is at the present time near 1.2 children per woman.
Last time, when this rate was over 2 - what is known also as a replacement rate - was in the year 1976.
Therefore why get the Singaporeans not more children?
Tan Wei Ming, directress for marriage state and family politics of the national population authority, says that this is to be put down to a "better training" and "greater career chances".
"This made for the people possible, except for getting married and forming a family considerably more options with respect to life aims of having and priorities put", she declares.
These changes in the social factors contributed to the higher number at singles and at the putting off of the marriage and births whose result is the decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile an immigration politics which is aimed at a drastic rise of the immigrations in order to counteract the decrease of the population led to resentments during the local population.
In Singapore there are web pages, where the hardly hidden xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese who are criticized for their holding the wages low and not integrating themselves.
The rise of the immigration is regarded also as one of the reasons for the government party achieving their worst election result in Singapore last year since the independence.
Since the choices an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers was made.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate is having the known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax yields, the health costs and the immigration politics, the example Singapore shows also unexpected consequences.
The government attempts to achieve that as many small apartments are not built.
So she already has also effects on the housing market.
The authority for urban development that is confessed as "Shoe boxes" and the city may be built in certain fields began with controlling the number at small studio apartments.
These studio apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales impact.
However, the worry exists, that they can support the life-style of the single, and that they deter the building firms from building big apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, president of the EL immovable company of Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold very much more quickly than bigger living-units.
You are so popular, and the units are faster around days and even weeks sold out as the bigger living-units.
This results in their being very much better for our Cash Flow.
He admits, however, that the new norms give the developers clearer orientations to which before obstacles were put into the way if they wanted to build too many small living-units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way for a rise of the national birth rate, it is to be understood from the conversations with the Singaporeans who work in the finance quarter that they will not have any great effect.
"The people are strongly stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, for which it is pushed out by many" a young manager says.
The children can get others.
"For me it is important, over" a man other, about twenty years old says "to decree my own money and time".
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the costs for the property and the education as reasons for their not being able to have any children.
Therefore the Singaporeans have to get the last word children if it is a question of that - there the government can do still so much.
The off-line private off-line one is in an online way private
Privacy
According to the dictionary it is a question in this case of the property privately or "that field of the private life, where one has claim to protection from every kind of interference".
What is private for anyone under 16 years?
How is this definition used for his everyday life and the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers which he exposes itself to if he makes known in the Internet situations which it would not divide into the real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people in the age between 10 and 15 years who are frequent in the net on the way.
They associated the concept in four of the cases with "a little very much own" on personal level and "onto the password and the user", if they used it for the social networks.
"I would not announce my deepest secrets to mail office in one" says the 10 years old Jorge during the attempt, the importance of to declare "privately" in web pages as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it is having accounts for two years.
"Those ones are very confidential secrets, my mother may know it, however not the whole world", he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I pass myself away also my time with acquaintances.
"I would not divide any photo that is not from me or of somebody, who" says "the fool makes" it.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends that he has in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Under that also the mother that has the password to one of the accounts.
I enrolled myself at Twitter in order to express and to write interesting Tweets.
"I do not know whether anyone answers to me I load it highly" he only adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can "speak" quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends" it indicates.
Asked he answers, that he would never pick up an invitation of a stranger.
Even if somebody recommended a foreigner to him, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year long José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the persons which he added to his friend list.
"That does not frighten me because we have something commonly for the example music", it indicates.
According to specification of the boy nobody did him hints or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If somebody badgers me or demands it from me, I simply remove it from my user account" he admits.
José reported to Ask after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
Experiences which one knows as Cyberbullying today are not unknown to the boy.
The acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed in a social network.
You threatened it and demanded money.
"He has never found out who it was", he assures.
According to José the victim did not close the user account.
"It made it only private."
After that it explains a series of steps in order surely to configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge this Young photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations would load.
Yes, I would do that if it is disagreeable to me or I want to wipe him out one.
"Aber I know, that dies Cyberbullying is" it declares.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, teacher for English with college end in education and learning, means, that in order to inform the children and young person, must be understood, that informing is a purpose of the social networks.
"Das Internet arose as a medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these pages the game rules "changed" themselves, however, she says.
Porras explains, that the academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master title in pedagogy at the university Yale and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" these concepts for the declaration of the phenomenon shaped.
The digital ones Native it is, that Kinder and young people that grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that are supposed to teach it where nevertheless we even still learn" it says.
It declares that it is a question of a complex topic "because we demand of them that they have a defined criterion above that what spreads, publishes or may be said and this in an age, where the maturity for that is not sufficing."
"You are supposed to be also particular if it is most important to them, liked to be to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" he adds.
According to the specialist the most effective kind and manner is, the children and young people to teach what privacy is to put to them questions that she brings to the contemplation.
He says "to say to you they are not supposed to do it, not functioned".
Porras names afterwards some possibilities: There are things which you would not tell to a foreigner. Why do you do it then in the Internet?
Or: It you would be fallen to, when one a photo published by you, as you published that, that from a friend?
Do you know what the others about you publish?
Did you ask to the other persons before around permission if you have tagged photos of celebrations?
And another question: Must they all know what you do in every moment?
A further point is how they do it in an off-line way to understand them to give that they in an online way must act.
It is the same rules.
"Somebody outside of the internet sells respect, morality and other principles, and the same one must be valid for the social networks", it declares.
Supervision
Estuardo Guardia, professor, elementary-school teacher and educational consultant, comments, that it indispensable, that the parents read through the guidelines of the social networks carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have sound basics in order to talk one to their children about the importance of the opening up user accounts in the Internet.
"For example the age, or what one may divide or publish" declares it.
According to Guardia the children onto the lesson must be remembered "You are not supposed to speak with foreigners".
End of the summit conference of the Unasur without publication of the declaration of Lima
The 6th summit conference of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the declaration of Lima which before was announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven ruling present ones.
Efe attempted repeatedly, access to the signed document at the VI. Tidy meeting the state and government heads' of the Unasur attain. Sources in the state and president office informed at the beginning that they would hand it over according to the written examination, declared after that, however, that it would be published at certain time on the web page of the Peruvian government.
With the case of questions to the text they indicated that the contents were explained by the president from Peru, Ollanta Humala, with the case of short declarations onto the press.
The access of the journalists to the information about the summit conference was restricted to every time.
During the day in the press room only the picture of the president meeting without clay with the announcement became "private meeting, restricted audio" transfer.
The few information that circulated among the journalists were obtained by the press agents of some of the governments of the Unasur present during the meeting, however not of the Peruvian press agent.
The single document which was spread during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused uneasiness at the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media which required more information.
After that the presidency sent the media an E-Mail with the "end declaration" of the summit conference from Peru, at which it dealt with Humala around the declaration and not around the official document to the end of the summit conference.
In last October Peru was host of the III. Peak's South America - Arabian states (ASPA), and also on this occasion the so-called declaration of Lima that one had announced before was published little in the same way in spite of emphatic request through the press.
On the official web page of the ASPA one can convince oneself, that the document on the last Tuesday was published.
Accentuated on both international meetings the Peruvian authorities, that the information systems would be available for the journalists, they restricted, however, the access to the information in a high measure.
The summit conference ended also with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the court of justice of The Hague which settles a border conflict between both countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would pick up the decision of the IGH which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the addresses to the jury of both pages in the process which Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will follow and explain the judgment on the differences which we bring forward to this international court of justice at the present time", said Humala together with his Chilean vis-a-vis.
"Chile was, is and remains also furthermore a country which sticks to the international laws, searches peaceful solutions for quarrels, Abkommen locks and submits itself to the international courts of justice" adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshaking before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit themselves to the IGH occurred after to Colombia according to a decision to submit oneself to the judgments of this international court of justice over the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it held for a difficult error complaint against the agreement had risen from Bogotá which it agreed in.
During the summit conference present the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were.
Paraguay, which is excluded by the Unasur since 2011 according to the deduction of his president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The guest-giving president Ollanta Humala started the conversations on morning and ended the summit conference shortly after the lunch hour in Lima.
The head of state sorted out the end document in which it informed that 16 decisions were found and the action lines defined for 31 projects between the South American countries about an investment amount of in total 17 billion dollars.
He said with regard to the found decisions that steps "meaning" the countries of the Unasur "in the direction of the objective of a South American citizenship to which we expand the decisions on stay rights will do."
It informed that measures would be driven forward in order "to improve the cooperation in the fight against the insecurity in the cities and against the organized, country-overall crime as well as measures, in order to correct the access to medicines and to the Internet to low prices in all fields of South America and in order to act in the case of natural catastrophes together and efficiently".
With the crisis in Europe may the economical consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphant trains accept, but is supposed to be used for stretching our production achievement and showing a better future to our nations Humala added.
"We decided on giving the priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects that the spatial-dimensional connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas improve sollen... and thus our countries unite and new economic systems open up", the Peruvian president said in a declaration read out.
Under these projects also five Peruvian would be that would lie on the cross axes of his field of the coast to Brazil and from what two are supposed to provide a better connection with Ecuador although it did not give any further details.
In the same way Bezug took the end document onto the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope for the dialing process serving for his resumption in this country in the union of South American nations" from which it is at the present time impossible.
The necessity, that Latin America remains an integrated region also furthermore for prosperity and peace and with good nachbarschaftlichen relationships, was a further aspect that was accentuated on the summit conference.
In this sense the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said, before beginning of his participation in the regional meeting, that he expected a meeting with his vis-a-vis of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico in order to handle the maritime conflict respectfully according to a judgment of the IGH questioned by Bogotá.
"Possibly I will meet the president Daniel Ortega on the day of tomorrow (Saturday)", said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not excluding, and conversations with Nicaragua make also the agreement with Nicaragua necessary, it underlined".
"I hope for being able to say to the president Ortega that we will handle this matter so civilizedly and respectfully as possibly" added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention to be present during the office takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As a part of the summit conference the defense ministers of the block for the discharge of the measure plan of the year 2013 met also previously, in what the dialog and consensus with respect to the defense of the region is supposed to be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members at the UNASUR even if the latter country is currently impossible.
Peru has the chairmanship for a limited time of the regional block.
"South America must learn during the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship "is" an objective with the case of which "in fact South America can learn something of Europe."
"Correa who participated in the 6th summit conference of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) to occur in Lima declared the state television in Peru" that the Europeans "in the second world war and in other quarrels killed" themselves and are today practically a homeland."
In this sense he defended the project, to create a South American citizenship that the member states of the Unasur drive forward.
"The free traffic of the citizens and workers in all South American countries Must be achieved, how the case ist;es already in the Andes community gives this, however, still reactionary sectors that strive for a return into the past", it warned.
The president of Ecuador in addition approved the rearrangement layout of the organization of American states (OEA) under the handicap, to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and to consider those that signed the agreement of San José about human rights.
Those that teach never commit themselves to something, and in the corresponding train for this purpose we the South Americans sign always everything.
"It is unintelligible that the inter-American commission has their seat for human rights in Washington and is financed by the United States", it declared as an allusion to the political asylum, the Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has given.
Correa assured that he does not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles in this way but his "deep democratic values and opinions about human rights has come later.
He added, that at that time it "justified suppositions has given, that Assange would be delivered to a third country and his procedure not be kept."
It in addition criticized the Swedish justice which demanded from it to subject it to an interrogation on his state field because of an alleged Sexualdelikts while "the Swedish jurisdiction is allowing this by means of a video conference which could have been carried out over the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa declared that the danger would exist that the health and the psychological state of Assange would be influenced.
"Since it is in our message, I did not speak with it, the ambassadress informed me, however, of his having an easy problem with the lungs, however, none fatal", the head of state of Ecuador said.
The danger that it would take physical and psychological damage because it is caught in a narrow room and cannot carry out any physical exercises in the open air withstands it, however.
"That would influence the health of every human being", he added.
Correa served, that the solution for the asylum that was given to Assange since the month of June in the message of Ecuador in London is the grant of a charter with which he can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities Europa's. It underlined that there were conversations with London in order to find a solution for the founder of WikiLeaks locked up.
We do not sell the human rights, we do not use this word for this case, there were, however, constant conversations.
"The solution for this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Swedes and the juridical authorities of Europe because the attorney leads a row from Assange, Baltazar Garzón, of procedures on different European authorities", it declared.
And "if morning gives this charter to Great Britain, this is in my opinion done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or above Skype as it approves the Swedish jurisdiction and was made in other cases, the problem is done.
Correa took the opportunity, in order to be confirmed as defenders of the freedom of the press and said, that what he" does not "tolerate", this mediocrity that bad intention and the lie that invalidates the free opinion comment are."
"The tallest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists that strive for profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense he congratulated himself, "that Ecuador is not governed by the bankers or hegemonic and spit middle class countries anymore of such journalists and neither", and anticipated, that it "will deepen" with the case of a re-election "the revolution, in order to continue the way into this correct direction."
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to his next choices in the case of which he argued that the organism "must stay "hard and no opportunism and none as a coup dressed up legal may allow", because "the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay was destroyed" by that.
The president of Ecuador in addition holds the wish of his Colombian vis-a-vis, Juan Manuel Santos, now and to discuss the lake-legal borders between both countries according to the judgment of the International court of justice of The Hague, which divided the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua, for "completely entitled."
At the present time this judgment is not transformed.
It is a question of a problem between one south- and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, they must be overcome, however, in the aspiration to a common way.
You must be treated comprehensively so that one can overcome it and look forward.
In the same way he trusted in a good end of the quarrels about the lake borders between Peru and Chile in front of the same court of justice and meant that it is correct for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries sign up to accept the judgment himself if it in a very hard way breaks down."
With respect to the possibility that he positions himself into Ecuador as a candidate for the next premiership choices in order to reach his third mandate in consequence he served, that it this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy sees although sometimes it is difficult also very much."
Correa assured that he would withdraw from the political life if he lost the choices in February 2013.
Power has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was it that guaranteed this probable victory, therefore I must follow this responsibility", he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, after that I withdraw from the public life.
This is valid also if we lose.
"That is decisive", it declared.
Correa took Bezug of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, also onto the treatment of the sanitary problems of the president in Cuba.
I spoke just with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He said to me that he traveled there for a planned, routine treatment, and that it would be expected that he can travel to Cuba after the choice campaign again.
It commented, "It does not mean a relapse in any case in the health state of the president Chávez".
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in the 6th summit conference of the state and government leaders of the union of South American nations (Unasur) that was ended with the call for a higher regional integration in order to guarantee for a lasting progress, equality and security in Lima.
A too late recognition is cause for a death because of Aids today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when one confirmed him the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb struck", he says about the moment in which he received the diagnosis that the doctor without "weakening" recognizable success "attempted".
He hid it from his family.
He decided, to see only to his illness and began with finding oneself out of that; and this with such use, that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly to one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into which it came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the humane Immundefizienz-virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hardly conceivable at the beginning of the nineties, when there were many doubts, few treatment possibilities and more stigmata.
Then the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided it itself to say goodbye "because it led to a dead end-de-sac."
Then AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with living quality.
However, still many persons come into the clinic that does not know anything of their illness and that already caused the virus at those ones damage and that exhausted their immune system, and the victims of opportunistischen infections are.
"The great success means", 31 years after the appearance of the AIDS in the world, that is after appearance of the first told cases, "today, that are exactly now the survival of a patient that incorporates the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population", the conductor of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, near which he said that this information in April of this year was supported by a scientific publication had a look at, declared.
The specialist for infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented on the scientists concluding since the year 2008, AIDS not being indeed a death sentence, however, the years of the survival and the living quality of the degree of the influence of the immune system of the persons at beginning of the treatment taking off and that that greater chances would have, that are not drug-dependent: up to 30 years a counting's of 200 CD4 and 50 years' with the case of a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply said, the above carrying out means, that, who in the age of 25 years the diagnosis keeps HIV-positive, in this sense "problem-free 75 years old can become as long as he is under surveillance" this specialist declared.
In order to be able to classify this progress correctly, must be reminded of the durability of the Mexicans today being on the average 76 years.
Even if the mortality has been reduced in the last years significantly (in Mexico the number of the persons which people die of AIDS reduced 4,862 to itself from 6,678 cases in the year 2007 in the year 2011 (Annual report of the ONUSIDA)), nevertheless it is correct that since the appearance of AIDS 60 percent of the patients registered in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 persons died in the year of 2011, and up to the month of May of this year it is already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there is universal access to the antiretroviralen drugs since 2005.
- Why do always people die therefore still of that?
- In my opinion the problem is not the access to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we had no supply problems near the medicines. The problem is that the persons come in far advanced state because they do not know their infection state that is in very late phases of the illness.
It does a beating statement: "Coming" to "nine of ten patients to us if they have already a concurrent infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, for which recognition tests must be offered to all persons with whom this is necessary massively."
The specialists and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state committee for the AIDS-avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients as Fabrizio which made carry out his test near a private lab agree to this proposal, and this was that one for the only reason because a friend of it had done it in spite of his young age already in the AIDS-phase and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a crustaceous tumor) had what one of the usual complications is.
Everything is different if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would not like to hear anything.
"When I must already die, burst more gladly then three times", one says in my case.
The change was to the there improvement, I eat well, do sport and take the medicines.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone else also.
"I work, undertake a lot, split up an active, but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person, Fabrizio that agreed counts in order to encourage with his report those that today are afraid within the framework of the worldwide AIDS day his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO".
You should do the test if they belong to the risk group. Know ever formerly it whether they are HIV-positive, all the better, and when they already know the diagnosis, they are supposed to learn how one can live as all people responsibly.
His information is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen big holes exist, declares Ricardo Salazar, journalist, from Guadalajara who took care of the thing of the HIV.
And the most important thing is the prevention.
At the places characterized to that "the distribution was increased from condoms in fact; formerly they were given separately, now they add parcels to us with a hundred pieces, which is already good, there are, however, still people who do not "have" any access to a condom", he said.
The young people belong to the risk persons for new infections.
"To what you need that one"? a spread mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health system, is which young people would not like to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested to inform this inefficient distribution again; the condoms are not supposed to be only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities to which frequently young people go.
The promiscuity is not supposed to be supported.
The beer and motel is not supposed to be paid to them as the governor Emilio González answered the question whether under his administration preservative would be distributed.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to familiarize those that carry out already a sexual activity" "with the condoms", it brought it onto the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 accumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state lies nationally seenly near 4th place of new and accumulated AIDS-cases, and near 13th place with respect to HIV.
92% of the contagion cases occur via sexual intercourse, 6% about the blood and 2% in a perinatal way.
It is reckoned that 50,000 persons with HIV live because there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know it for every registered case.
After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgment which does not acknowledge the restructuring of the obligations of the group of Vitro which was achieved via a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is created for every national enterprise with subsidiaries in the neighbor country which has payment problems.
One could say therefore that the procedures for the survival of the enterprises which approve the Mexican laws do not have any validity in the country of the stars and Stripes contrary to international descendants.
In the practice that one leads on 15th June issued recognition of the judgment by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the Mexican enterprises of the seizure of their property being helplessly exposed to bravo beyond the river.
However, the decision opens for the tallest glass manufacturer in Mexico Tür and Tor in order to call the uppermost court of justice of the United States because of three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the thing is referring to the believers having to succumb to the bankruptcy law of the United States, the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in New Orleans says first of all that it is with the case of the main procedure of the commercial bankruptcy handled in Mexico a question.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures with the case of insolvency of enterprises with country-comprehensive profile is not known.
In fact the model law of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law with the case of which the American Law was used institutes as a mediator was created for this purpose.
Secondly the judgment determines that without the voices of the societies after recognition of the obligations in the bankruptcy mass which the branches of Vitro with their holding company had the necessary majority would not have been reached for the restructuring of the obligations.
However, this possibility of the Mexican laws is acknowledged.
In fact Vitro is not the first case in which this pattern was approved.
There is half a dozen of examples, under that Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, who obligations were confirmed to the group by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal institute for commercial bankruptcies) under enterprises.
Correct is in addition, that to withdrawal of the voices of the branches the believers of Vitro, the believers that complained near the courts of the United States against Vitro, that is the vulture funds as to B. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited would have reached, no majority.
The vote would be 45 percent gone out against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the court of appeal.
On the other hand it gives Vitro Schuld for his difficult situation 2008 within the framework of the great economical crisis in the United States that gave strokes to the country.
For this reason the family González Sada inserts contradiction before the same court of appeal through h so that the vote occurs in the plenum. of all judges, because only three of them voted.
That is not allowed to, if the Cerciorare-objection is made which requires the inspection of the procedure through a higher authority, in this case through the Uppermost court of justice of the United States.
The fatal thing at this case is, that the court let a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the court) in which the procedure carried out by Vitro is described within the framework of the law about commercial bankruptcies, and in which refers to its having asked strictly the descendants signed from both countries in order to correspond to the chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States aside.
In addition refers to the country submitting itself to the principles to the commission of the United Nations for the international trade, that is the defined rules for the cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantees the equalization of debtor and believers.
Zweibandige Karambole: a stroke for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the advertisements did not come through the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade who is accused of a fraudulent administration several months forward, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Trade union association of the pilots) did progress at last.
The request led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau submitted now a punishment procedure against the National Bank and Security Commission, the hindrance of the justice is reproached.
After that the inspectorate refused systematically to inform the head office of the republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove 198 million pesos from the trustee account F/589 of the bank IXE on the names Mexicana de Aviación.
These means were used to the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration) for the acquisition from stocks.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main stockholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting at the weekend on a forum of the university of the Caribbean a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, decided entrepreneurs and general members the middle class society the creation of a Wide Front in order to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a gigantic sale and marketing center in Mexico, Zentralamerika and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, complemented by 150 enterprises with a living-field for the employees.
Previously the Canacintra (the national chamber of the using industry) reached, to unite the governors in the southeast in order to oppose the monumental equipment that destroyed and the mother of all threats of the industry represents partially protected fields.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of an inquiry of the senate, to declare under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador signed in Japan the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement that is known under the English abbreviation ACTA not has come later, the matter was already archived according to the Mexican institute for intellectual property.
As you know, these measures occurred although the senate had drawn the possibility except for consideration because he considered it as a violation of the free opinion comment in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the aspiration to paying long-term obligations without influence of the short-term obligations the building contractor Homex launches stock exchange certificates over 500 million pesos.
The emission is the first of four same emissions which promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Foundation of Competival
Enterprises of the information technology leading formedly from the enterprises NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, a company group was founded under the denomination Competival, whose aim the service market of the software clusters in Central- and is South America.
The corresponding investments are near more than 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes: "Basketball was my living"
The globetrotter of the basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was associated to the basket sport longer than 60 years and bereist the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a so big intellectual collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Of Reyes.
Before it was tied to the rotation chair by a stroke in the year 2008, Rexes was for 6 years part of this sport, it is to the first national league, to authorized representative and to conductor in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or to president of the basketball association as players of lower classes, players.
"My life long I put myself on many hats in the basketball, even several simultaneously when I was president of the BSN, main manager of the national team and president of the association in the nineties" Reyes remembered at a visit of Primera Hora with it at home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his true wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career almost all and testify.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that remind of his time at the Vaqueros of the middle of the fifties as players to 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year long anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or managers of the club.
"Those ones were my best years that I enjoyed the most because I am a part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it than were allowed to be managers, Mitgeschäftsführer or coaches.
There were years fulfilling many, including the five championships after each other of 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
Off then took over "Cuco" Ortiz that was a very good manager" says Reyes.
I still know that Gene said Bartow which worked as a coach here and was done by Alabama (Birmingham) at the university to me: "I have a player very strong and 2 m tall.
You would like it"?
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow recommended after that the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse who could be naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I still know how he said that Gausse would worry for another if Mincy had facilitated a championship for Bayamon.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was given to him, however already out of a distance, because it already stood in 1988 at uppermost place of the association.
At this time he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I still know when we won for the first time during the vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the USA.
After that the world championship came in 1990, at which we the fourth place occupied, Reyes said what actually bronze should have been if this Canadian referee had not been that made us the last game train for the second time repeat.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team which you ever saw?
It belongs to the best, as also those who won during the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite is, however, the team of the Pan-American games 1991 in Cuba, where we extracted gold and offered a fight to the team of the USA, as, when they extracted bronze against us during the world championship.
Near that team only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were not again in this case, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Of Morales that could not be in 1990 because of a knee injury in this case.
A team which maybe was not the best with which we, however, won a gold medal and which prepared great joy for us with respect to personalities was that of the vorolympischen tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players as "Canito" Of Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as substitute for the banned players because of the incidents on the Pan-American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal towards every prediction.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was Piculín Ortiz without doubts.
His numbers on level of the international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated on this level so as Piculín did.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a series of good coaches as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What believes you is the best thing that you achieved in the association?
I was a part of the most successful era of the national team of 1988 to 1995 which the BSN grasped to up to 17 teams at the beginning of the nineties in a season.
Does what still doing remain to you?
There are things which I would have imported as e.g. the regionalization of the lower categories.
That play the Jungs in Ponce e.g. only in their field and stumble on teams first in the national Playoffs from other corners of the island.
Today the children do unnecessarily many journeys and games.
At least I see the result of the stipulated training and courses in coaches, table-official ones and referees.
On that I am proud.
What do you do today?
I hear music gladly, sees videos of music of my time in YouTube enjoys, my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel who was always at my page.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on the 21st September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became worldwide famously with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known than "J.R". in the TV series of "Dallas", where it played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, his role as the oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV series of "Dallas" for a symbol of the avarice of the eighties became, is dead.
He became 81 years old.
Hagman, that this year as J.R. in a new relay of "Dallas", died came back., producer of "Dallas", Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a press release of the family at The Associated Press through warners Bros.
"Larry was back where he played again the iconic role which he liked the most in his loved birth city of Dallas", said the family.
The family of Larry and his narrowest friends were with it in Dallas for the celebrations of the harvest thanks celebration.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and consequence series, was at Hagman, when he died in the hospital of Dallas, their publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It did all joy that knew it.
It was creative, generous, merry, witty, loving and gifted, and I will miss it very much.
"He was an ingenious person and lived the life in full trains", declared Gray in a communication.
Hepatic cirrhosis was diagnosed to Hagman in 1992, and he admitted that he drank a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumor was arrested in his liver, and he subjected himself to a transplantation.
In the years in front of "Dallas Jeannie" of the TV organization NBC "Enchanting" with the Sitcom on televison as a nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 became known to Hagman.
There it played the astronaut Tony Nelson that life is put on the head than it one attractive "Dschinn" strikes (played by Barbara Eden), that will live at home with it.
He was also an actor of two comedies, the only short time were radiated, how to. at. The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Well assessed roles belonged to his cinema works from the criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his brilliant interpreting of the charmingly detestable J.R. which turned Hagman into a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS about the Ewing-clan and other figures in their surroundings was radiated of April 1978 until May 1991.
The advertising slogan "who fired onto J.R."?, the expectation for an episode of full emotions should create led where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were bet in bet houses.
In this way the series achieved a spectator record in that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by 41 million spectators on the average which changed "Dallas" into the second the most seen conversation program since the end of "MASH" 1983 who had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) the had fired.
J.R. she had impregnated and threatened with representing her as prostitutes if she did not leave the city. But also others had reasons for wanting to see it dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: an insidious businessman and unfaithful husband who strove to make send his alcohol-sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know, what on the tombstone of J.R. is supposed to stand", said Hagman 1988.
It should mean "Here the honorable citizen J.R rests. Ewing".
This is the only business which he did not gain.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, remembered on Friday Hagman as an "enormous personality on and outside of the screen".
It is unforgettable and unreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and we that had the luck have it to know it and to love him, preserved in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TNT TV channel.
The photo of five chapters for the second relay was finished, and a sixth chapter was just turned, the sender informed.
Of warner or of TNT there was not any immediate declaration to how the loss would be handled by Hagmann in the series.
It the son was, born in fort Worth, Texas, to the actress and to singer Mary Martin who played classical works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was another young person when she got Larry during their marriage state with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He attempted his luck on the stages in New York at the beginning of the fifties, after that he helped from 1952 to 1956 in the air forces in England.
There he became acquainted with the young designer Maj Axelsson and she got married.
The pair had lived two children, Preston and Heidi, and they long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their residence.
In 2001 he entitled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I did not write anything, from which I believed, that it harms somebody or could influence it" onto some wise", that of the Associated Press said at that time.
After the liver transplantation he supported liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital in order to stand by anxious patients.
"I advise it, courage I meet them gives to them if their operations approach and "after that", he declared in 1996.
I would like to offer them some comfort, how e.g. "no fear, it is a little uncomfortably the first time, but you will be fine".
In the same way he fought against the smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begin the course's that studies the "end of the world"
The students examine every week apocalyptic topics as e.g. the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
Every semester if the religion professor decided on keeping off a course about the end of the world he knew that it had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long Rückwärtszählung" of the Maya-calendar on the 21st December from which many people believed that it means the end of the world.
But Charmé did not have any presentiment, what it in the following ones both months should expect: the destructive hurricane Sandy which some referred to as "Deudarmaggedon" as well as an increasing conflict under participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theoreticians believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I did not notice, that this the most apocalyptic semester is, that it ever gave" Charmé said to the students this week at the university Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If somebody analyzes what pleasing is today as if we were away thirty days of that in the world, would be this a really good period.
And it reminds of the bad thing being good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses about the "end of the world" this semester which actually should be the last one in the history.
In Temple the sitting professor Barry Vacker gives "Media, culture and the end of the world," the course.
The students examine every week apocalyptic topics as e.g. the nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and the global warming.
"We analyze, for which these ideas with the time spread", he said, as well as the kind and way in which hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reaches the hands from terrorists, for example a war could break out.
This month the students films with apocalyptic contents analyzed and examined as they could be compared in comparison with the real life.
"I attempted to inform the students of what is possible, probable, plausible and impossible", said Vacker.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania university the professor for Latin-American history formed Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari a sitting professor for history of art and anthropology a team in order to offer a course with the simple denomination "The end of the world".
"We do not incorporate in 2012 so that we keep always the option to be able to keep off the course again for the case that the world does not sink", said restable.
In spite of the "imminent fall" the students must study, create projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination is carried out at the eve of the apocalypse, for which the students do not have any other chance than "to weiterarbeiten up to the night, where the world supposedly draws to a close", said restable.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were not any places anymore" said restable about his course in students with high average which filled itself with 35 students.
For weeks before semester beginning we received E-Mails of students who asked whether places are still free.
The students for her part their part assure that the course numbers among the most interesting.
"It is to be seen fascinatingly what the people do in order to comfort oneself", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year old student, in Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic champagne or religion mentality is actually only a question of comfort or his absence.
The 25-year old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing declares to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never I have not heard a little about an instruction, where this is taught", it indicated.
I enjoy it.
But no one of the consulted students - and less other professor - declared to believe in the last date of the 21st December.
"The prophecy of the Mayas handled our first project, and in certain way we discredit her", said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, in a 21 years old way and from west Cheshire.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it is a question only of a key point in the calendar, said restable.
He says, however, that in the western society an apocalyptic fear exists which takes back several centuries, when the people reacted to changes in their surroundings with the forecast of the end of the world.
The Internet increased these speculations.
"Elsewhere the people do not think so", he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor of the university La Salle which teaches this year on the Philippines answers quickly the question whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", he wrote as a hint onto an exception of a higher authority.
We have a reprieve of the Pope.
Restable referred to many days the last court talking about the years, and said, that if on 21st December nothing happens, "the people think of a new date immediately" or about the 21st December being the beginning of a seven year long period after which the end of the world would come philosophized.
Students and professors take this date easy.
Several said that they would like to go over "the end of the world" to celebrations.
"Maybe I call a few friends so that we can laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year old student for communications.
