The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justified policies need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre will read out the last a myth, arguing that cases of electoral fraud in the United States are less than the deaths from lightning stroke.
In addition, lawyers for republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative effect on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
This is why most state governments since 2009 pass laws complicating registration, or vote.
This phenomenon has new scope after the election in November 2010, which led to the Republicans of 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result only in one 2011 it was adopted 180 bills restricting the vote in 41 states.
New election laws require a voter to show photo identification and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right to register a voter on the day of will and take a vote of citizens having a criminal record.
To the 2006 elections any American party did not require voters to show photo identification.
Indiana became the first state that introduced a similar requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law adopted in Indiana in 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice and other states.
In the last two years they initiated the bills requiring voters to show identification cards with the images in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens have no such universal ID card, as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, that is 21 million people who have reached the age to vote, do not have photo identification, their staff issued by the government body.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have a similar document.
The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds 100 dollars.
New restrictions disproportionally affect young people, minorities and people with low levels of income.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% voters from 18 to 29 lack the required photo identification.
But there is more to come.
Students - voters who believed to vote for the Democratic nominee in several states are not authorized to use the photo identification issued by their school.
But the same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for republicans, to use the evidence produced by the clubs to vote.
Until 2004, any state did not require proof of American citizenship to vote.
A similar requirement was introduced in Arizona for the first time.
Since 2011 more than a dozen states had enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, clearly aimed at limiting vote of Hispanics.
It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican legislators initiated laws by abolishing the registration of voters on Election Day in eight states in 2011.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction didn't take place without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign to voter registration helped impose about 10 million people in the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall 17% levels of registering new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, republican legislators passed laws aimed at reducing the time for early voting in five other states.
So, in the general election of 2008 in Florida of 33% voters voting ahead of schedule, were the Americans, although the latter made only 13 percent of the total number of voters of the state.
The same happened to Hispanics.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
Unlike white which, forming 76% of voters, among voting field-commissioned only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Some draft laws were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial law that was suspended for the intervention of the United States attorney general.
This allowed to limit the negative impacts partially.
For example, only 16 of 34 states passed laws requiring the presentation of the photo identification.
However, the new rules that took effect, of course, would make it more difficult suffrage on the 2012 election.
Critics on democrats condemn bias of laws adopted as if this is a clear focus on affecting the election results 2012 in key states.
The Brennan Center report of 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws, the current to 171 270 votes necessary to electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening prostate cancer: to pass a test or not?
In fact, the test of the DOG gives sometimes wrong results, pseudo-negative and sometimes pseudo-positive that lead to useless medical intervention.
For men, and so reluctant to passing a medical examination from how to begin to doubt even more.
To pass a test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
A study in the United States, numerous cases of infection among groups investigated so it is difficult to interpret the findings and difficult to develop any clear recommendations were observed.
Other research, this time European, found a different death rate in those patients who received the screening, and those who did not miss it.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation that the odds of generating a actually is 30-40% higher for those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass a test since 50 years, or 40 if one of direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are subject to an increased risk.
The key thing is the right decision as soon as the cancer is found.
The cancer can be both aggressive, and slow.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer treatment, offering it options, without necessarily cancer of the prostate, which does not pose a threat to life in the long term, and choosing, in these cases, in favour of robust monitoring the disease.
Today, many men at whom the cancer is found, will not get treatment as their cancer is not aggressively and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance and if the disease is progressing, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we with precision specify the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive medical treatment.
Thus, I would recommend to pass the test after all.
But it is important to cope with the doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International association of urology, Movember created a tool to assess all the pros and cons passing of the test for the DOG.
The document (while in English translation will be available soon) you can download at: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, respect for a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people beautiful ate and moved enough 30% of cancer cases are preventable.
"If no one did not smoke, this figure would be at least to 50%" - andrè Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian association of cancer said.
However, an estimated 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Some types of cancer utterly inexplicable.
For the Canadian association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It did massive harm to human health.
"Even today in Quebec 1.5 million smokers are" - andrè Beaulieu's spokesman said.
The encouraging fact: 10 years after smoking to die the risk of cancer is declining half.
Weight
According to CT data, overweight and obesity and encourage the disease.
It increases the risk of developing breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular exercise during the life guards from colon cancer", added to the Association.
Food
The association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.
At the same number it increases the risk of developing cancer of the large intestine.
It is necessary to avoid the sausages.
Meat maintained by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage cells of the body and lead to cancer development", explains for Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists were researching the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment it's impossible to call the results of these studies unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E produced conflicting results.
If one of them showed lower risk of developing prostate cancer, the other was the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer of vitamin D and there is no clarity.
But Mr. Bolyyo stresses that it is important to discuss the anxiety and family history with a doctor.
"Delivery of the analysis does not lead to cancer".
Higgs' boson in detail
Last summer, the message that he may have been able to find the Higgs' boson caused a big boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that the boson explains the mass of all particles in the Universe, no less.
In addition, it is the latest particle whose existence has predicted for the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, the "least imperfect" description of nature and behavior of matter, but that failed to find practical consideration before.
But physicists is not yet sure that we are talking about the Higgs' boson.
We know, without any doubt that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it poses to Higgs's predicted by the Standard Model of the boson greatly resembles.
In addition, the new data presented this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, it seems to confirm, although for the full confidence in some data doesn't get.
Let's imagine, however, that he is a matter of Higgs' boson as likely to be wrong seem minimal, and we'll see what it means.
Is, in this world one law absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent the rule there is no way, don't even try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.
But while the physics of elementary particles is quite strange world, it turns out that it too, there is one law of this nature: the principle of the exclusion of Paulie which posits that two particles can inhabit the same space in the same time if they stay in same "a quantum state" is "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
Accordingly, physics shared particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find a respectable citizens called fermions who sensibly submit to Paulie's principle.
In other bosons, mean gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means fuss that they can be a very peaceful in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, extraordinary) Particle Adventure of Laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided, in turn into two groups: мезоны of which we are not going to say, and "force particles" by which the main force of nature extend that Higgs' boson in some way concerns.
These bosons, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this record, it is for one regions banal boson: to photon, or "light particle" that is "courier" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a piece by electrical charge is accelerated or changes direction, we "breaks" electromagnetic field in this particular place, much like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violations" the electromagnetic wave (light, or the infrared radiation, or the package, etc.) is born, and this wave is than other, as the photon - and therefore one of bosons of "force carriers".
More stable field
So it is with Higgs' boson, the only difference that in order that the boson turned out, other field, Higgs's sex should be "broken".
But Higgs's sex are much, much, much more stable than an electromagnetic field; to improve it, there should be very, very high-energy as if it was a question of a frozen pond surface very big stone to shake.
That is why the huge particle accelerator, as what is exploited at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km is necessary! To achieve such huge force-matter.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is useful as well to the balance explanation between Higgs' boson and weight.
In fact, not all particles and not all material interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others are not: A sheet of paper, for example, he will never keep on the fridge.
In the same way, not all particles interact with Higgs's field: what interact, have mass while others (as a photon, by the way) don't have that.
So, what "can bring" all of these studies, Ms. Plamondon asked?
In science they are used for testing the accuracy of the Standard Model (SM) and it also allows physicists to explore the divergence between the results of monitoring and forecasts See.
Moreover, some of them fervently wish that this divergence has been found since the slightest gap could open the door for "The New Physics" and stop up a few holes of the model.
The last, needless to say, still has significant shortcomings, without offering any explanation for gravity (oh! ) or for the dark matter that forms around 80 per cent of the Universe (very oh! ).
But while at CERN such differences have not found.
Consequences
For the daily lives of average person is more difficult to predict the advantage of these studies, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
Look: at the very early 60-ies pioneers of studies of the laser in laboratories Bell could not imagine that revolution will be caused by their work.
They expected their applications in science, but no more than that.
Indeed, too late physicist Willard Boyle who worked in Laboratories Bella where in 1960, a laser and who he developed the first permanent laser (previous was invented were pulse) in 1962, said that initially, the laser was seen as "The laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
And in addition, the application can be for instruments accompanying the study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle in the optical research in 1969, developed a small sensor of light.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original mission, is now serving as "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in Physics of 2009.
It certainly does not imply that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... "debt"
In the Commission for worthy death in Quebec the sensitive issue of the end of life was recently discussed.
The debate must soon be resumed, and Bill prepares at this time.
However, in this critical area much remains to be done.
"Debt" tried to look closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Eshche living alone in an apartment in Monterezhi.
Prostate cancer destroying it from within, granted him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven", he says, between life and death, lying in bed in a shelter of palliative care Victor-Gadbua in Grow white where he is the day before.
"But he always shock, it is impossible to be prepared for it", he said.
The disease does work: incredible weakness that does not allow to go independently to the toilet and even self to eat.
Sitting at a table on which there is a delicious meal, he is given and agrees that it helped to accept food.
He is invigorated, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around them, bring it drugs, lead him in the bath.
Courage over the regular death.
"My biggest desire that I cured of diarrhea, it is degrading", he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found medicine for the disease.
"During their lifetime us teach that the man must urinate standing", Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in Victor-Gadbua shelter said.
To recovery from the child's condition for some unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the human capacity" to accept decline, he said.
Because, according to many people who are engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of that decline.
Patients who arrive in the palliative priut Victor-Gadbua, everything had cancer.
Forecasts make them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses does not provide more help called "medical".
Ms. 89 years, are most afraid to die "in the minds of asthma".
But the disease allowed me to recognize the children.
"I have good guys", she adds.
"I want nothing to life", she says before allowing to deliver a mask to facilitate breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit to a son who came from Italy.
In a shelter Victor-Gadbua via group of volunteers give body care and help from food.
It is also palliative care, which remains when nothing more can be done.
To make the death of more comfortable.
In Quebec one place is the share of each 11 700 residents in the institutions of palliative care.
It is not enough, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions that are possible, Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors refuge explains.
Whether comfort physical, emotional or mental.
Dying we will agree to provide oral rinsings from brandy or Pepsi, looking that he would ask.
Diabetics we no longer force to control sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday existence.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. h.-p., who died tonight.
In the morning his son drank the beer in the legs at the dead.
"We help relatives as patients", says Natalie Savart, director of care for patients.
In a shelter Victor-Gadbua any day is similar to past.
Near the 93-year-old old man who enjoyed the last meeting with a family in the court, and settled down on the pillows in a toast in his honor, the young man for 36 years, surrounded by parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovashiya everything tragically dies to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years", said Dr. Christian Martel anxiously says.
53% of patients admitted to shelter Victor-Gadbua, come from the house and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to care that is given to alleviate the suffering of the patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as Shelter Victor-Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home of Big Montreal, specialize more or less only on care for cancer patients.
This big gap in public health system of Quebec forces many doctors, specialists in palliative care to be afraid of the adoption of the law legitimizing the euthanasia and assistance in suicide.
Since October, the manifesto signed by stars in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfur mount and doctor Bernard Lyapuant and proving their disagreement with a similar initiative is circulating.
According to Dr Kristian Martel, health care system Quebec is inadequate to ensure the right to quality palliative care before the transition would be permitted for euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient who spent 14 days in an office in terrible pain, and nobody has the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I am afraid that patients want to die because they don't get cariage.
At the same time, many oncologists till the last day of trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes of survival elein Richard were minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said regrets that I give up the fight, she said.
However, she told me that my days are numbered.
All-powerful care is not
Doctor Martel believes that 90 percent of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, that they did not meet their request after the team of palliative care takes their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not entirely omnipotent to combat pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of Big Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to a partial sedation in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or permanent.
It is impossible to pretend to be more that we do not know about these suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to relieve pain, will be able to have access to a partial sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die".
But it is meant not necessarily "I wish that I performed euthanasia" it's understood "I want it became easier for me".
The creation of this story was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Studies of health Canada.
Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
The officials responsible for building roads, construction contractors, collectors of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia say day after day that they know about the huge "system" beset the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
"Industry" that is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is interesting as this system is scattered after all means have been put to use, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and former police chief of Montreal" jokes.
Thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a by-product of the investigation of the malfeasance connected with road construction contracts in Quebec on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest agreed very reluctant to burst.
"Dyusheno's report" established direct connection between the industry, secret financing political parties and corruption.
"Since the investigation began in 2010, he stressed, only the Ministry of Transportation would save billions of dollars on contracts" if some tempered his instincts to take a share.
Charbonneau's commission "already displaced two mayors" he adds, hoping that it will cost "to open the schemas behind individuals".
Permanent divisions on the fight against corruption, created in 2011
A permanent division that was created in 2011 was connected to business to fight corruption, which includes the vast state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, members of the special unit "Hammer" who in 2009, forced "waste cartel" Montreal to stop inflating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks, a series of searches, and some municipal officials, such as Frank website and Richar Marcotte, the mayor of a small town had been made, the charges of fraud and corruption have been submitted.
In turn is Gilles Wayankur who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third biggest city in the Province of Quebec.
I suspect many receiving bribes at the time of the state orders.
In addition, formal accusation was brought to a few engineers of the Ministry of Communications of Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The last blew up a real bomb, saying the investigation at about "system" of securing government contracts.
For several years Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts in Montreal, to some intermediary related to the mafia, who in turn, money transfer of the party of the mayor Géralde Tramble "United Montreal".
In the 2000s Zambito squandered money to the right and left. He had handed over more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) the various parties of the province, mostly to the liberals who were then in power.
He also admitted that illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from Natalie Normando's Liberal party.
Sewer contracts where inflated value
In Montreal "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Suerprenan, a former construction engineer, described in detail it before the commission: Ten years, he received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to travel to tournaments in golf, in restaurants, and bribes in total for 736 thousand dollars in exchange for a sewer contracts, which cost is overstated by hockey teams.
Other officials responsible for building roads, admitted he received on his paw, overestimating accounts by 30-40% through false additions.
Then one organizer from the party of the mayor, Marten Dumon, accused Mr. Tramble that it is deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of parallel budget nabivaya party ticket counter with dirty money.
After these revelations Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, rang alarm bells.
The mayor of the district of Rivyer-de-Preri in the east of the island, it faces from 2010 to the sale of municipal site bought for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million to developers at the height of construction boom.
70% of dirty money to campaigns
She said that in the investigation that will eventually be started, she "will pull on the balance, allowing us to understand the system operates, thrive with ants to stop the gangrene and determine guilty".
She describes the process as "painful, but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but its own investigation team and the observer will be needed to Montreal to avoid return questionable practices.
As we are moved away homes.
Regularly.
Jacques Dyusheno notes that in his "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars" but especially he is concerned about the role of "elected officials, aware of this scheme" but not involved in fraud.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec hits 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality".
The government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 a donation to parties but said it will not change the situation: "While we are not strictly limit election spending, in politics there will be dirty money".
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of state contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot fall below; having safely crossed into the heart of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger base, with the best control and the rule of law ".
If this story also casts a shadow over international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno encourages those who laughs or to look into their own yard...
"PSG for - not FC Barcelona."
This season you in PSG for achieved unusual application.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but can - and a new dimension of PSG for.
There were great players.
Next to them I grow every day.
The technicians also put a lot of things.
These factors make me to raise the level of my game day.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I don't burn.
From the beginning of the center of advance preparation in NIF in Klerfontena and before I came to Saint-Etienne I always went forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti...
To supplement this summer not to play matches on a very high level a novelty.
They also know that every training session is very important.
It leads to such a player as I am eager to be up to standard and to give his best effort.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti support my positioning.
It is helped by the deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Anchelotti is a master of the situation?
Of course.
Anchelotti inspires respect in all techniques.
Today in the Premier League it's hard to beat and it is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience, and he won many titles with high quality clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think it will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation.
Then I moved from a series of traumas.
The confidence that it has to me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season of PSG for?
In the First League Lyon took us a place of the leader.
But we still on call.
One of our main goal is the Champions League: we were effectively qualified in the one fifty-eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to pass as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to say the word face to face with a very good European teams.
First we want to finish first in our group, before Porto to be able to accept the return match in one eighth final.
Whether there will be able to be a PSG for top European club in the short term?
It already has a budget...
To become major European club, Paris needs to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term.
Today it's not so.
Financially the PSG for have the means to make the project real.
Not to take the title in the First League how last season, will be a big mistake?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we really earnestly hope to catch this crown.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points being taken by the title of the champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think we'll be okay.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title was introduced by such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media wait too much from PSG for?
It is normal that we are expected to much, given how much was invested and what players at us.
We fully are ready.
On the other hand, when we win homes 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what scarify, of course, it frustrates a bit.
We wonder what waited first of all of us human.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We try to bring the game project.
The team was formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which already has two seasons fail to be held in one eighth final although they also spent a great money!
Given the attached amounts, we show you on 15 points ahead to the winter break.
It would be disregard for our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not on the ball last season, were "awakened" in this new PSG for.
It shows, the First League is how exciting.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
The PSG for seems entirely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's exploits.
And that if say that there is some "Zlatanozavisimost".
It just means that Ibrahimovic is a very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this purpose and it proves a star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he had shown that he is a great player and a global star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He, too, respects people who surround it.
What he did, it is only valid.
It encourages others to improve the game.
Competing alongside Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, and motivates all to move forward.
How do you experienced Euro-2012 from French team?
As disappointing.
I earnestly wanted to take part in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a little playing time.
I saw there a lot of things, and I left it stronger.
Today I manage to play good elimination games.
That what I hoped for from the moment of my baptism at Blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now have to behave is exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Decham at the head of Blue?
They are productive.
It is well positioned in the selection panel to the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, close with players and inspires on victory.
What was Laurent Blan.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blan achieved his goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier Decham will bring Blue into Brazil.
A deserved draw (1-1) that has been pulled on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental game?
This match has given us confidence.
Everyone fought for all.
To this shock in Spain, in my career there were no similar matches.
To pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, numbered deals between receiving parties with fees on their processing.
Moreover, as there is often to these technologies, explicitly political vision: belief that the current monetary system consisting of bank monopoly, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, a fictional Satoshi Nakamoto (nickname) but at the same time is virtual currency (but converted to dollars, euros... ) and secure protocol of exchange as BitTorrent which allows file-swapping between members of the same level.
About 200,000 operations were already registered from 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take bitcoins for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin course, having peaked at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2 before coming back today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in his report on the virtual currency, published in October became interested in the system.
It describes the bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
The bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as used to advance in the video game that are made in the game or who are possible to buy (and sometimes to exchange "loans").
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But foreign exchange transactions always controls and processes any central authority.
In the Bitcoin all hosts are at the same time, the holders of the book, auditors, issuers of currency, pokupately and sellers.
How the network functions?
Each transaction between two people is going on between the two e-mail addresses, like email.
For each new payment you can choose a different address, thus providing anonymity.
A lot of information related to the deal is signed elektronno, using a system of encryption with a double key.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the deal.
Thanks to file content, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the deal, really exist in the public accounts book sent across the Web.
Key stage is registration of new deal in this book.
It runs through the decision of the mathematical challenge sent to computers, decided that if the temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line.
Rather, it is a phase of the mixture of the file, that is the transformation of a large file to the electronic signature short and unique.
Computers "take" new deal and add it number before "the mixture" all together.
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found other nodes easily test that is right.
Deal is thus nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any amendments will change the electronic signature.
If for the purpose of cheating the user quickly (in less than ten minutes) wants to pay twice a year and to the topic, the money, only one of the two deals would be confirmed by the network - and another would remain non-validated as they have different digital signatures.
A computer that has solved the problem, receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved perhaps until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in the address so is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one millionth that leaves a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increases in computing capacity.
Network life has had ups and downs.
Their webspots services Bitcoin, have been attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
"The used defect does not concern the protocol", Pierre Noiza who has recently launched Paymium - the company making payments by real money with Bitcoin network use says.
The European Central Bank also reported the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also has this deficiency.
Major players like Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations.
Others, like WordPress blogging platform, fix them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from Weizmann's Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not occur in turnover.
"Huge sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", Jon Holmkvist working in Coinabul dealing with the conversion of bitcoins in gold being happy.
Pierre Noiza, another author of a grant for the country's currency, a firm believer in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in the real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it is using Bitcoin to verify transactions that leaves cheaper.
The owner controls personal data better and can be anonymous way.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Suffice it to report only address that can be "photographed and distiuguished" the phone, Pierre Noiza indicates, asserting that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of revising hierarchical systems in favour of a more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin would be adopted, will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The European Central Bank in the report suggests to review, by the way, the various risks that are seen as the raised, in the case of the success of this system.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left the area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army it is time to regain control of territory, and for Afghans to choose the future, without looking only for us.
The Afghan villagers whom we considered terrorists suffered from us in general.
And ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and maimed.
The taliban be foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign army as it did at the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbek, Tajik join them.
Them suffer, they are aided sometimes by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will start to behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from base Nidzhrab I saw from the hills set with almond trees thanks to the French loans made in order.
Convoys of trucks and armor, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, of the invasion of the Taliban into Kabul will not be.
Circumstances have changed since their overwhelming advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups.
The arresting country control then was perceived as a kind of release, return to security.
Afghan women paid for rear-guardism of these farmers in which they were surpassed by Al-Qaeda, but the situation has not improved today.
The former mojahideen, the Afghan government and present the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become entrepreneurs using public lands to resell them for the building to immigrants who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, with the vast American contracts for a contract manufacturer.
They are discredited; Most of them, by the way, even were not at war.
People as I heard in rural areas, want a government that would be not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as those who managed the American generosity will leave: Capital outflows is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its benefits.
Some 65 per cent of the population is below the age of 25 years; in Kabul 5 million, a fifth of the general population is now.
Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs of these young people who will not want to return to either rear-guardism of old parties or corruption of some heads.
Everything, including armed militias, love mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world and kind everywhere.
At the moment the army.
The authorities to order, will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders leading anti-Soviet fight, already take measures to restore provincial teams would not submit to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, highland, with strong local differences should be decentralized to some extent, based on the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that has existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the election scheduled for April 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not put on its feet, any dam does not function, any irrigation system is not fixed.
Everything is imported; nothing is done, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is to private initiative.
In the country was on 30 years of war, the state control over infrastructure should be.
Rumors circulated that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
It only strengthened the impression that Western countries were present there, only to take them.
Without energy for processing of iron ore and copper on the ground, out-of-pocket transportation to export them through the mountains, no mining.
Chinese almost left the field of copper of the month Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded World bank) dig out a huge Buddhist complex and to be major employers of the province.
It is also essential that one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which much of import and export depend, restored normal relations.
The conclusion of the French combat troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides the preservation of traditional assistance: School for girls, for boys, French department at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in an effort "to win the hearts and minds" and to carry out an impossible task of combination of aid offensive operations, maintenance "military and civilian activities" at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) Abolish in 2012, with little French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities for agricultural recovery in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with an intense attraction of local labor, could help to contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protect soils and increase in the area of arable land.
What are we going to leave for the memory of, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
Much more modest budget would help improve local livelihoods, very hard in these valleys located often at the height more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of a small agricultural work based on local communities in the province of Kapis.
To get rid of the riots directed by foreign groups that wanted by farmers as they told me, it is necessary to give them little not military support that could well be controlled and would come to them directly.
Difficult confinement of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily places it emergency powers, it decided to go for broke.
Having taken everyone by surprise, he said Wednesday that the Constituent assembly will vote in the final text the following day.
It was a week ago, the head of state, provided to the meeting two additional months to finish the job.
Soon two years as Egypt is guided by the provisional text to the proposed amendments were a few times that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in the "autocratic nonsense", continuing "breaking the word" and "to violate the right".
Of the camp of his followers are confident that it is a way to complete institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces Brothers to give up the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.
For President it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent storms across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, seems convinced that Egyptians would vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American Time weekly.
Especially as the call for an expedited vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I give myself emergency powers" that is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday to the text.
Most liberals had not responded to the call.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they left in a huff, feeling it is not able to inform.
Representatives of defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society has made the same.
That the necessary quorum has achieved, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
No wonder that in most cases articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators are poveselilo by the way, by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day began around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee considered that hours of the Constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text in which yesterday there was a vote, consists of 234 articles.
Winner of the public's attention, article 2 eventually was left to the same article from the 1971 constitution saying "the principles of Sharia are the main source of the right".
Salafi parties for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules" that would allow their stricter application.
For the Islamists of the fact that this article was not changed, is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", liberals who see him as public relations response.
Because they believe Islamization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They point in particular Article 220, which give the Al-Azhar university, an advisory role, particularly in regard to check for compliance with laws to Sharia.
According to a specialist in Egypt Sophie Pomye, it causes alarm as "the people, designed to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can observe theocracy origin ".
Many liberals are also excited by the fact that the next chancellor of the university seems to be much less moderate than now.
"At the moment there is no specific religious intervention.
With the Constitution we remain under civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on the text is not the ulama, and people with the university, some were trained in the French system "- Alexis Bloye who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition comforting.
But he acknowledged that "round article 220 there can be no ambiguity as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This particularly applies to the "fiqh" [Islamic law - dominate the edition].
And in the future could be a question how the civilian courts have jurisdiction to rule on it ".
In addition to the religious dimension, text accepted yesterday, has been criticized as it gives some big powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims that they were much reduced compared to those at the old regime.
Another controversial issue: powers of the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will not take place in Parliament and national defense council.
The trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from human rights associations will not be prohibited.
The latter also expressed concern about the text that they deem detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is maintained and insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom from now on is prohibited.
In addition, any articles no longer talk about the protection of the woman, Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch said.
According to her, the only positive moment shows the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president should have been last night on television, demonstrations are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waited with holy sites, the Center of the universe and the sea from rappa
The promised land unites the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristine nature.
"Caif" identified five most important reasons for it is necessary to visit Israel.
Let's bow to the holy sites
It is worth a visit at the Jordan River in which there was baptized Jesus.
It is believed that everyone who comes into this "font", God's grace condescends.
And Galilee is the place of the wonders of Jesus: changes in water wedding in wine, circulation in the water, calming of the storm and content of networks.
Here he was before students and after the resurrection.
But most of all holy sites in Jerusalem.
Believers there are the Way of sadness or the Godfather Put of Jesus (in Latin - Via Doloroza).
It begins at Anthony's fortress - Pretoriuma - where there was a court and on the streets of the old town leads to the Temple of the Sepulcher on the Mount Golgotha - the Crucifixion occurred, the Stone of the oil and the burial place of Jesus.
There is a symbolic Christian Center of the universe, symbolizing the Save our humanity.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem would raise as a place on Christian legend, the tree of which made the cross for Jesus' crucifixion grew.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred site for Jews - the Western Wall remaining from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 g AD.
Traditionally, people of different confessions leave here notes with desires that come then.
Travel down
The ruins of fortress of Massad remains of a secret shelter from enemies Herod velikeho built 25 B.C. for the family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at the height of 450 metres above sea level.
And those who enjoys mountaineering can reach them under their own steam.
The rest to this historic top are supplied by elevator by cable car.
And in the north at the height of 1600-2040 m there is a well-known ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months, a huge wave of tourists.
From the foot of Mount oversupplies bus shuttle.
The total length of skiing is 45 km.
According to the ancient legend, at top of mountain allegedly lived pagan gods.
To visit unique museums
In this country of 300 museums.
For one trip to all you will not attend.
But at least five of them that are most interesting, it is worth a visit.
They include the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
The oldest Kumransky manuscripts, or the rolls of the Dead Sea found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and about 500.000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits are stored in it.
It is worth a visit and Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
Paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, C, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are represented on his expositions.
In Acre, it is possible to visit Al Bashy Bath representing several halls of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bathhouse ministers of the time.
Unlike bigor, it is worth coming into a private Museum rally where you can admire Dali and Rodin's sculpture.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance free, and donations categorically are not acceptable.
The fifth, the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv says about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is a children's memorial is built in memory of the 1.5 million destroyed in concentration camps and the gas chambers of children.
You come into it, which appear in futility.
Stars targeting.
Also names of Jewish children and the name of the countries where they died sound.
Ukraine there is also mentioned.
To get healthy
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and the Dead Sea.
On each of them there are pools, aquaparks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea swim even in winter months as water temperatures there does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air is warming up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is hotter, and there swim throughout the year.
By the way, the most unusual sea is in the world in the throes of the planet - 417 metres below sea level.
Azure water in it, the olive, easily holding afloat not even able to swim.
Landscapes around it is unreal are beautiful.
Go here to receive medical treatment with the use of salt water - brines and healing dirt and treat health at dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes to put its shattered nerves in order.
To touch the secrets of antiquity
They are held by ancient part of Tel Aviv - independence Jaffa's small town on the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city has been mentioned in Ancient Greek and Ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here Noah built the ark, and Perseus saved beauty Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists really like walking through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
Speak when you touch the walls on the Street "the" sign, Fortuna is profitable.
In independence Jaffa it is possible to meet the newlyweds coming from all of Israel and even other countries to photosession.
And unlike bigor, a city of King Herod - you can wander on the Roman theatre "to take" the solidity of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
Carefully restored Theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
To a tourist to note
Going to Israel, don't worry about the imperfect English: in the country about 30% people speak Russian.
On a trip it is better to take money out of the euro, and in dollars, which is easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollars - 3,8 shekels).
The city transport - mostly buses, but in Jerusalem is the speed tram, and in Haifa - only in the country the line of the Metro consisting of six stations and connecting nizhnii the city with Top.
In fact, it is an underground cable car.
Passway in all types of urban transportation costs 6 shekels for whom it is possible to go with change within 1.5 hours.
In Israel by Jewish tradition on Saturday celebrating the sabbat.
Since Friday evening to sunset on Saturday the markets, shops, public transport shut down.
And on Sunday in the morning working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food excluding pork, seafood, fish without the size and dish in which combine the milk with meat.
They offer a wide range of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked in coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste hummus, different sauces, balls from ground chick-pea - фалалель, fruits and vegetables.
On the streets of Israeli cities there is no stray dogs.
But there are a lot of well-fed cats who it is spectacular "walk alone".
The evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of their parked cars.
Murlyki like crowded places and do not give up the food.
Car rental, depending on brand, will cost from 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - 15 dollars a day.
And Bicycle bicycle would cost $15 Shek. a day.

The language of figures

The Promised land from January to October 2012 was visited by 118,8 ths. Ukrainian tourists 51% more than a similar measure of 2010, before visa-free entry on February 9, 2011.
"Great and Powerful" in Moscow will bring: migrants save money on language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, in the country there have been rogue trading "fraudulent" evidence
Up to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities there are 13 million gastarbeiter.
This is mostly the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to make money to sustain their families left at home.
On December 1 law under which each migrant would be obliged to take the test for knowledge of Russian came into force.
While this rule works only for those who plan to work in services, housing and utilities, life and retail.
But over time, promise in FMS, tests become mandatory for all visitors.
If you want to hand over not only a language, but also the history of Russia, and legislative reasons.
Knowledge of the language should be confirmed both to extract and work permit extension.
The exception only works for citizens of countries where Russian is the state language.
Are not subject to the law and the people, in time to obtain certificates and university diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Advantage, hopelessness and protect the rights
The network of examination centres will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian the name of Pushkin, University of the friendship of people, the Moscow State University, st.-petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; Now in Russia more than 160 such centres open.
The initiative regarding the introduction of testing supported both the State Duma and FMS.
But human rights defenders before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the question in the press: and what it would actually give?
What will change commitment of language skills, both for Russians, and for visitors?
Above all, representatives of the immigration service answer, would reduce the number of people who suffer from "labor slavery".
So many now talk about protecting the rights of migrant workers, the head of the representation of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan viktar Sebelev explains.
The protection of their rights should start to their departure.
Only a system of organized kit will allow us to solve the problems of foreign workers for 90%.
Problems appear at migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not with physical exam.
Without understanding of language, "Sebelev is confident," future migrant is bound to face unfair people under the guise of a bailout would put to them "permit" in a spooky close barracks where she and dozens like it for months will languish without food and documents, pointing to 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one, and on arrival them deceive, select passports, do not pay the promised wages" - the head of labour migration of Ms tadjikistan Tolib Sharipov confirms.
Don't swear, nasyalnik!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics gathering for work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country sought, but also on His Own write yourself.
Of course, it is not so much their wine, how much trouble: the few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can afford to get even a robust primary education.
After all, at their families, there is nothing even feed children not to mention that did to wear them, to put and equip in school.
Growing to adolescence, the children at the first opportunity go for jobs.
It is difficult if it is wrong with knowledge of the language, they confess.
"You feel small and immiserizing".
However, on the law on language human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for migrants who have the legal status.
If the status is not - will be neither examination nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiter still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, and stranger entry is prohibited"
Many visitors claim that it is not easy to be granted official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here false registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Members of the Russian police knows that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, hence extortion cases.
"Asked one hundred, two on cigarettes, tea", a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Hushkadamov shared with journalists.
"Travel, do not be stingy with, buy painting"
In the first date of the law on language it became clear that false are not only migrant documents for registration.
Some "fraudulent" evidence of the passing of language tests have already been seized by officers of the FMS.
Counterfeit papers are published in the common colour printer.
Of course, the new owners had bought them not for nothing: each of the migrants hoping to make it easier for the challenge of taking tests paid 7,000 rubbles for the document.
This is more than two times more expensive than procedure of official testing: It will cost a migrant three thousand.
That the main challenge in the near future, in order to defend the system of corruption that "crusts" could not be bought just meet, and authorities, and human rights defenders.
While the authorities may promise to the guest workers who have not managed to successfully test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, the visitors who do not know the Russian, work in areas that are not that actively communicate with people will be offered.
The Interior Ministry does not pick up the illegal market of weapons
The share of crime using a legal weapon is smallest
The Ministry of Interior of Russia proposes to tighten the law against owners of the civil weapons.
This is a reaction by the authorities to recent incidents: To press shots at weddings when no victims, and the massacres committed by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which hit seven people were killed.
Police want to ban for травматики in public places and to raise the age from which it is possible to obtain a license for weapons ranging from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the State Duma Committee on Security and anti-corruption efforts Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the law on the weapons would make the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities try to address the problem by "pulling the plug".
Online there was an open letter, which sponsors, representatives of the different public shooting organizations - demand to give up "pointless tightening".
The hooliganism percent with a registered weapons is minimal, lawyer-criminalist vassiliy Lesnikov told the Russian BBC service.
According to the Interior Ministry, in six months of 2012 142. crimes with the use of firearms registered in law enforcement bodies while all over the same period 1168 thousand crimes were recorded are committed.
The authors of the open letter are confident that legislation tightening in the field of civil weapons does not place to the criminal to go marketing "black".
Now, according to them, you can find any weapons in Moscow in the low price.
Meanwhile in the Ministry of Interior argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" market of the weapons less several channels.
The main such channels five, a colonel in resignation Viktor Baranets, ten years worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff said.
Screenshot of the site taking orders for weapons
The first "the army or military footprint" that is the weapons that were stolen during operations in the Caucasus.
"Weapons carried by Russian officials and europeids", Baranets said.
The following form of "the black weapons" kidnapped by criminals in the security forces.
Baranets explains that this included and carried away by police warehouses, and stolen from directly law enforcement officials.
Illegal "suticases" go on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that part of the arson attacks were made specifically to cover the shortage", the former military says.
The contribution, according to Barants, weapons manufacturers bring.
"Now private small-arms factories that do not compete in the international market fruitful and throw the guns covertly on the black market, including Moscow", he said.
Another source of "black" market-is smuggling.
Especially comes rifles and machine guns from poor countries, for example, kirghizstan much.
"There is a production, sometimes artisanal, and the mafia, which organized the flow" was formed, the former military explains.
Where weapons?
Experts estimate that approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the "black" market.
A report on it in 2011 prepared the Center of the problem analysis and state and administrative design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on arms subject.
The preponderance of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons in the black market was there "because of officials, whose work is involving weapons", the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of cases, the weapons come from the field of armed conflict, 14% of cases a theft at a weapon manufacturing phase, 5% are concentrated in the "black archaeology".
Retail assistant of one of the weapons stores, asked not to call his name, says the weapons found black diggers, for a long time no one buys, too old.
More often than not, as he says, with new party sellers go on a military warehouse.
Through the ensign of people buying unit, for example the gun TT.
To get her, transfer through a zaborchik.
"It transports him to the city and now sells for 900 euros each with two stores" he says
"However, the police are aware of all cases in which periodically when the plan for solvability of crimes burns, performs control purchasing at dealers in illegal weapons", the adviser added.
"As in luxurious shop"
The seller and buyer most often find each other through a friend.
I looked at sites, blogs, a friend who offered to come to the Running platform where there is a man who will take me in "corner" where we will deal haven't responded yet.
I learned the barrel price only there
military observer Viktor Baranets
To get the body an acquaintance who had an outlet is necessary to me, retail assistant says. I have so familiar, but I'm not certain about him.
Sellers in the markets are, but it also will have to come, conventionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich who asked to say that at the daughter of tooth-related fell".
I even get a couple of brass knuckles through a man in whom he believes.
It too will deliver them only for me because he knows that I will not hand over it.
New look for weapons different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets tested as the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s while preparing for publishing an article about it.
Schemes, according to him, did not change.
He was given an album with pictures and was "nothing".
"I felt like in luxurious shop", the military recalls.
To the buyer, according to Barants, do not offer a pig in a poke everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, we put a target.
"I give a chance to shoot and when I am convinced that the weapons beats well, we start bargaining", he describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet bring sites and groups in "VKontakte" where offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
For this purpose non-documented and personal meetings are necessary.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", write in the advertising cap on the site "Buy a Service Pistol or a machine gun".
On it users leave the demands and ask questions.
And minors will sell?

The federal security service now разбросила a huge network of false sites and those willing to buy arms for war rows with a shovel.

I have heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered beyond the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through an ATM paid.
"In response, send a photo and specify where the weapons" hidden, a spokesman of a public organization "Right to arms" Dmitry Kislov said.
Viktor Baranets argues that leaving the demand for the site, it is possible to remain without arms and get behind the bars.

Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to remain within the sum from 100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the Right to arms organization, Makarov pistol can be had for 100-300 dollars.

On official стастистике departments, compared with January and October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole contracted by 7% and made 22,9 thousand, and the number of facts revealed of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices was reduced by 7.8%.
In the US workers of fast food and supermarkets strike
Through working at the box office "McDonald's" switching to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days across America, the wave of protests against low wages in department stores Walmart corporation and restaurants of popular networks of fast food, such as "McDonald's", "A burger King", "Tako Bell", "Uendis" and "Kentucky фрайд чикен" a ride.
While no one is to predict whether this wave will become the highest surge or it is destined to exhaust in the early stages.
Actions support unions and a number of the left public organizations.
Except raise modest salaries that are received by ordinary workers of Walmart and system of fast food, the goal of the organizers of protests is the creation of union organizations.
While the economy is not covered by almost trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Action began last week after Thanksgiving, known as "Black Friday" when the orgy of cheap sales, which took million inhabitants and sometimes accompanied battles hit America.
On this day, some employees of Walmart Corporation where 2.2 million people around the world work, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and leftist activists corporation stores, whose products are designed for people of modest and middle prosperity.
Walmart sells everything from nappies, hunting guns and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are from an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers of Walmart come only at themselves at work.
Availability and the range of goods produced Walmart of one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell to the podeshevka partly because pays its employees a bit.
The latter also complain of harsh conditions of work, for example, on the shortage of trucks or hand scanners.
The action on "Black Friday" required to raise wages and complained that the cost of health insurance offered by the company, jumped from 30 to $100 a month.
It is too expensive for the typical worker of Walmart receiving 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise the srednuy salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost companies $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart entirely shifts growth in wages to the shoulders of buyers, every visit to the store would cost them on only 46 cents more expensive.
In the year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart note enough that protests occurred in just nine states and did not put corporation any damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items in the second.
A total of its cash registers at nearly 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
The representative of the corporation Dan Fogelman said in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that jobs have been left behind by a "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was only "the next public-relations stunt" labor union organized it.
"Free cash registers."
Protests continued this week in New York, where not Walmart department stores (in this progressive city were their facility, do not favor and so they don't) and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
The McDonald's said that it sells billion portions and after that it does not give you sick leave and does not pay you for honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, member of the City Council of New York
At present the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase over time, but not much, and their average ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
Less they in this expensive city are not earned by anyone.
As you can exist in New York on the money, for me it is incomprehensible.
Once through "McDonald's" missed almost a quarter of the American teenagers who have earned money behind their chips after school, living at parents.
Few people saw it as a major source of their food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly come interview to staff "McDonald's" who complain that have to live for this salary and sometimes even feed on children.
On the other hand, at a forum of the Wall Street Journal a comment that author notices hangs that irresponsibly kids if you don't know what you will feed them.
The challengers who started at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that at least $15 an hour began paying cashiers and chefs of the system of fast food, more than doubled their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that in the field of fast food trade union organizations were created.
U.S. law prohibits the administration to intervene and to punish defenders of the trade union movement by exploitation and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely eases their lives.
But it is difficult to reach a labor union fast food and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover of staff.
The holdouts
Noisy protests took place in this day and some other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day meeting "McDonald's" near Times Square, where some local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who has declared did: "McDonald's" said that it sells billion portions and after that it does not give you sick leave and does not pay you for honest work! ".
Demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blassio, who said "we must start simultaneously support workers of fast food they achieved fair pay and economic prosperity, which is due to every New Yorker. ".
As described New York Times event, it was the largest such event in the history of American field of fast food.
But several hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were employees of a quick catering in New York tens of thousands of people employed.
While it is unclear whether that spark will generate the flames of a mass movement.
"While to deceive the brain it turns out, the medium"
Popular among fans of modern technology the augmented reality subject can be seen recently, mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First in the summer at the annual conference, Google showed a working model, and then in November, it became known that an application for relevant patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from talking to the head of group interactive 3D Technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi suggests that for scientists from the company points - a passing phase.
They accept the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
Please tell us in general than your research group is concerned?
We are engaged in the interaction of a man with cars, but we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While the humanity in weight is stuck at work stage with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes sticking in them the finger.
We want to look for five to 10 years ahead and anticipate fundamental changes in this interaction.
For example, the prefix Xbox and sensors of Kinect is a step forward, and almost no Xbox with Kinect is not for sale today, everything interesting sign management.
What is expected ahead?
Despite the fact that Kinect transferred interaction with the physical level, much still occur on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Input information improved (the system receives more data) and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We try to change it, we are working on right 3D systems of display on the basis of various technologies, including projection.
It is necessary to release the computer world in our own physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in much more convenient form.
And above all to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
What do you think about voice control?
Popular piece, but will overestimate it?
Certainly it is impossible to call it a panacea - there is a privacy issue, because not there is always want to inform the people around the actions and intentions.
Virtually all types of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in the niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought over gestures, but not over wide, and with a stingy, short.
Thus gestures were removed no device camera, and wrist bracelet fixed movements of bones and muscles.
While it big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of the watch.
But in general the future behind the type of mixed management, for example, жест+голос.
It how?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this to mineral water bank?
You say and at the same time will tell.
I usually just say.
Oh, it would be very difficult to be identified.
- That is you want to force users to adapt under what may or the car can right now?
Not necessary, but this mutual convergence.
I think soon we basically have to work on developing new types of sensors that would allow more precisely than human responses.
This may be, for example, laser sensors, they give good permission for depth, it is very important.
If we are talking about your work with sensors of the Xbox Kinect that claims at you to modern cameras?
There is no permission, depth or something?
In principle the present generation is from what can make a start in our work on 3D recognition.
Of course, it's good to get pictures 8 at a speed of 1000 fps.
But it is not megapixels, and as The Matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies for us are not good enough is adds works to designers of algorithms.
That is, it should be remembered not only about permission on axes X and Y and Z.
The speed, frames per second is very important.
Movements of people are very dynamic, and current 30 fps is fairly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes made contact sensor of our Redmondsky laboratory with an adjustable slower processing - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern sequental sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between human and cars.
In my work the equivalent of such a device that does not require contacts that frames per second was more really would be useful to me.
And the number of cameras does not need to be increased?
In Kinect there are now three "chambers" one of which actually - an infrared heatsink, and second, the receiver of the reflected signal.
And here is the third chamber is actually normal sensor of visible spectrum.
It does not apply to determine the depth of object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of calculation.
It would be nice to create flexible analogue of Kinect, to be played with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help with 3D definition of the situation.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not submit to the public points.
It doesn't seem to you that in terms of daily use of technology of augmented reality glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, all the time to walk about maintaining the smartphone in raised hand, not very comfortable, but here's what I think: the "passing" augmented reality when on the basis of a cloudy platform you could switch from points to a smartphone, the projection display and further everywhere would be the coolest option.
Points is a very personal device, their strength (private things you see only) and, at the same time, weakness, the augmented reality on the basis of items will not allow you to work on virtual objects with others.
Let's imagine for a moment that manipulation virtual holographic objects in the air may not be available only to Tony Stark from "Iron Man" but also to a mere mortal.
There is a problem that critics of such an idea often point: there is no tactile response.
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers your group prepares to this challenge?
In the lectures I often say that the augmented reality is the seventh break of interaction between human and machine.
I think the admixture of tactile sensations may well be the eighth.
While some interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a kind of a base for the image.
It perfectly registers URGENT!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at giving here to these "to pictures in the air" to personal - for example, the interference of several focused ultrasound beams in a certain point where there is a finger, gives a sense, but it very weak, as if you blew the pads.
There are also rings on the wrists that affect nerve endings in fingers is also a promising direction.
And you tried to cheat the brain?
To make him think he feels that, it seems, should feel while he sees something?
There's a good idea, we have not yet try to do so.
Here's another problem that must be resisted for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in confined spaces is to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite is worked and over concepts of treadmills (not so such as in clubs), moving platforms as well as huge areas.
While to deceive the brain it turns out, the medium, is still very much for many years.
Here's what makes working on so attractive virtual reality for the researcher is many things in a very rudimentary.
Vkusovshchina instead of culture - Rosbalt.R
"Росбалт" continues the Petersburg avangarde project on the Nationals ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
Brilliant figures of the art scene in St Petersburg already entered the top list, whose achievements are outside the city, often finding recognition in Europe, held the All-Russia Popular.
"Rosbalt's" new hero is a controversial artist Kirill Miller.
The city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man, dressed all in red, which is found in the Russian Museum, at a summer garden, on fashion parties and the opening days.
Kirill Miller's paintings always collect crowds of the audience where they would not be exposed.
Kirill Miller is one particularly Petersburg social and philosophical narrators, founders of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of the Petersburg the vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
He is the face of the city, the appearance on the streets raising a smile at the citizens, lightening the mood.
He recently took a street organ in hand and became the Petersburg organ-grinder as ripe for this complex role in all the bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
  Cyril and why you still go to the city in all red, not in yellow or turquois, for example?
 I  chose red as a fashion designer who is dealing with the look and image.
In this world red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although society everything slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property.
But my provocations were designed to ensure that the conversation began.
The history of my agiationary reserves - an invitation to debate.
  And when did you realize you should be an artist?
  At an exhibition in the DC nevskaya where my drawings were exposed.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists has passed, and new, free like me were unclear.
I began to be friendly with artists of a new wave, with a postgazonevshchina that brought "Pushkin-10" and more wave was not.
I get into the theater, clothing, music, in all genres, except the word.
  - And that united in your Art clinic... It was important for me to go to the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative power should gather.
In 1995 I occupied on Pushkin-10, and there, when there was no repair, there was a music and artistic club, bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born: NOMY, Tequila jazz, I remember Cord brought to the Van Gogh's Ear project.
Cord and his friends lip-synched easy songs, they were in tight body stockings, among them was fashionable now a composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "leningradskaya".
Trakhtenberg was the host many programs to hali-galivsky times.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and he we was received.
The D 137 gallery, club "Griboyedov is echoes from Art clinic.
There our employees and frequent visitors left.
I'm a hero of yesterday's century when the culture something meant.
In 2000, the inquiry was in the press, the prize was "people in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the year" I was called, my climax came to an end.
In modern times by the old rules, it is uncomfortable to work, I am a man of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it's easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are shared, it is possible to be popular, but not a cultural.
 The easily-recognizable  manner is inherent in your work.
  Many of my pictures are hits, they imposed relevance and sharpness.
I will have the program exhibition "The Russian Museum in clowns".
Clowns - timeless category.
I social was before, is this is sick and scary.
But in the clowns everything is loose, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the world rescue by totalitarian mask by order.
Now on clothes meet, guided by external mechanics rather than on the inner man.
And maybe he could not offer a hand and Roger should spit.
And fraud will be removed by mask.
  - And recently we saw you as a city organ-grinder. The cultural city should have such a hero.
And who, as not me, be it.
  Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
  Now commercial art should be clear, considerate, sweet.
There is a collapse of cultures.
Before people got off in packs, bohemia loved one, gawks another.
Now all broke into microcommunities, now difficult it will be good for all.
I am not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to be pleasant.
Now we need to think it's nice to whom.
Now every cult hero for 100 fans.
  - And Stas Mikhailov comes into thousands!
  - Broshenka come to him, there the sekso-social sphere works.
And on the cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result there is less than the office, money, all wither.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive, not to spoil the cash.
I wrote these pictures to young people that one collector has them on the wall next to Falk and Larionov pisgs.
I started with pictures that usually finish.
Now often confuse concepts.
Say: culture spiritual, a culture of consumption.
There is no culture at consumption, that's quite another thing.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grew up with examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting pictures.
I this culture.
  Cyril that lacks to St. Petersburg?
  Good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: An official from culture.
But not all of them can be engaged in culture.
At the correct tzars everything wrong was the Kings, maybe, not really knew in culture, but they knew it was necessary to have the right experts.
Here in Moscow is now good consultants.
We in Petersburg have people that could be experts, but they are pushed as higher experts who correctly assess these experts are necessary and will let them pass.
Now the vkusovshchinka flourish.
The same Erarta, but recognizes them that they honestly say that not we accept all modern art, there are artists who have to find myself other museums.
  What is for you - Petersburg?
  Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow cultures is much more, there the ground.
And on our rocks to art raise complex.
The cultural ground we want, and we now have more than writers than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe, there are a lot of people curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer is thin.
We need to be fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project has been implemented through a grant of st.-petersburg
To give birth in space
The ground in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid killer.
Caravans spacecraft with earthmen aboard set off in search of spare planet.
To save humanity, there is a key question how to continue its kind in the context of weightlessness or on the same extra planet?
I think the choice is limited.
Real planets only two that can be managed at least hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars" - a senior fellow at the State ubai the name of P. K. Shternberg (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin said.
But if Mars conditions more liveable, on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
It is possible to live only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Started coming to reproduction questions in space from flora.
Half a century more done experiments on plants back.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the Earth's species.
Then the removal in the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies fruit flies.
In 1979 to space sent eggs from quail to find out how the embryo in the context of weightlessness develops.
We arrive at the release of a normal baby birds.
And here's the problem starts further.
"The problem that this baby bird must find a support, he has to get up on the legs and start moving", the head of the laboratory of the Institute for Biomedical problems (IMP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev explains.
Not finding support, chicks arbitrarily somersaulted.
And in 10 hours newborns had a full atrophy instincts.
Chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that in four days they just died.
"And twice we вылупляли chicks after he refused because it is impossible to work there with them" - state an experiment failure with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals the last time biological "miniark" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But the Bion biosatellite there is only gay individuals.
There was an experiment with rats who were sent to the space already with the fruit.
In principle, there have not found anything supernatural.
"It has just been on biosatellites, but again is a separate experiment, and such research should be done", Vladimir Sychev notes.
After the landing space rats had offspring.
But to approach the playback problem directly in space will not turn out yet.
Difficult task.
Animals, losing, familiar habitat, simply cannot understand sexual instinct.
The man, unlike animals could potentially.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and be able to create the right emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not done.
But women travel to space 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious that humanity has is the female body.
Our Gull has departed, and nobody on Earth couldn't say: whether it will remain after flying in space.
Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after the flight.
"No one answered the question" - a veteran of rocket and space industry vahtang Vachnadze says.
In June 1964, just one year after flying in space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan nicolaevsky was also an astronaut.
In 1988 at the second female astronaut Svetlana Savitskaya who twice visited orbit and even worked in open space, the son was born.
But the risk remains.
We don't have enough, the units has astronauts who after long flights all cost, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if it is more, this is dangerous, even with orbital flights" - space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov concludes.
Still, humanity needs to look for any new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating artificial gravity.
TsPK hydrolaboratory - a necessary preparation for the flight.
Here in the face of zero held test-cosmonaut meet skills in outer space.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If adults water, let and comfortable, and the alien environment for babies - native elements.
Small ихтиандры as if confirm that life on land left the ocean.
There is a link between what the baby is about nine months at his mother in okoplodny liquid, it is easier for him to get used then water.
In principle it is logical because of the moment of birth, since that first air goes only two weeks.
"It is not enough that something to forget", the instructor of baby swimming Marina Aksenova says.
In short, if the born child weightlessness more natural state, is necessary for a woman gravity, gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, the pelvis grow decrepit, the ability to fruit pushing falls.
Okay, we will also reduce it, relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can go, of course, in a special camera for delivery, it will push it out.
"And then what? "says Valery Polyakov requests unconventional questions.
On the other hand, artificial gravity too should the child.
Without feeling Earth's gravity, the body will not create a skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn in orbit, it is impossible as adult, to dress in a special download outfit for training.
It is just denied that he would be vital.
"And this experiment for which we will go, allowing the birth of a baby in an alien environment, will lead to that we will lead to a land of a disabled person, fully deadapted man", the head of the bioethics committee of IMBP Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov expects.
While the birth of children in space - the theory.
However, later time, it will be reality when earthmen on ships will go on a far-out planet that is home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Head audit division: Check shvarts-system failed because of politicians.
In the branches of government procurement the Czech Republic has a good control authorities and, despite a good law lags behind in its application.
Miroslav Kal's this statement, vice president of the Supreme Audit Office in an interview for the site Aktuáln ě. cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, that, in my view, we don't have enough", commented on Kal's situation.
The same conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities.
As an example of bad practices give Jane Q Nechas's approach to the so-called shvarts-system.
Recently, the prime minister stated that CDP (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - there is this is prohibited or zvierata?
"The law should somehow be established, and if it prohibits something, and the prime minister cannot resist the work of the institutions to which he had a responsibility to try and achieve obligations", Callas states.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties within the laws on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly has been discussed?
Parallel check that we began perhaps two years ago.
In other words, the speech that the European legislation claims how must pass government procurement, follows the national legislation and then its use in practice.
All information is collected and, even while still unfinished check interesting differences in other words were found, we can have the law "precise and perfect" but in practice we in some settings yield to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more following rules, we need to focus on the application of the law.
Indeed, as this project can help you, what it means for you?
The joint control can make a contribution to a stop to clarify the law, reduction and improved restrictions because it does not lead to a positive result.
The economy means obtaining thing for reasonable (but not always low) the price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we can get there, having reduced limit orders.
Perhaps this system will be filled with "papers" so that those who wish to find holes in the system, will find them much easier than if restrictions did not decline.
You talk about domestic issues of practical application of the legislation on government procurement.
And how the monitoring system in Germany work?
Is there an organization such as our CAM (audit office) and it works differently?
As for institutions, there Bundesrechnungshof arranged by our principle acts as our Kru, there is also the board working a little differently, but mostly both institutions function similarly.
In addition, the authority to some extent is similar, but as Germany has federal structure, there are parts of the audit and at the level of federal lands in their system is different from our little.
BRH can manage the federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal Audit Chambers.
As for the local laws, there it is easier than those of us?
In general, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany may be imitated, but it is impossible to say that it is better in all.
So, because they cope with greater control over?
Definitely not, but I repeat, such comparisons are not pleased.
But it is necessary to say that even the model countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they would not get any benefit from working with our office, right?
Speaking about the domestic law how were reflected in your establishment of an amendment to the law on government procurement, the consequences are somehow manifest itself?
Given that the validity of these amendments is quite short, this was not shown in any way in our work on control.
As we implement controls on, it must be some delay.
We take that into account only in the process of preparing future checks - we began to use our new tool "The discovery of the risk of not the economy" through which we sent nearly 14,000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be shown because restrictions change terms of certain types of tenders and so on change.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden of bureaucracy system?
I think this law, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
Problem that can occur, such is that the rules "will be increasingly strict" and they cannot be observed.
When functioning the previous rules controlled enterprises are associated with the supplier (for example, regional operational-level programs - with regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement would constitute a breach of budget discipline.
Is it worth tightening in that case, the law in such a way?
I think that not the way.
The system should exclude those who want to take and abuse, but not to punish those who make a formal mistake that leaving the decision.
This system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And while to leave this situation?
Let us know that this path will lead you to nowhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs checks of the so-called shvarts-system. What does it mean?
"Schwartz system" is prohibited or resolved?
The law should somehow be established, and if it prohibits something, and the prime minister cannot resist the work of the bodies to which he had a responsibility to check and make implementation.
It is possible to say: "We will change the law and we will solve it" but it is impossible to say that we will pretend as if nothing happens.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules like that should be made formally, and rightly so. It would protect government procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, that, in my view, there isn't enough.
Roads in places slippery, but are mostly traveled.
In some places, Czech Republic Road frozen and snowy.
Mainly, they are penetrating, but here and there are more care.
Carlsbad edge
This morning the Carlsbad roadside were ongoing, but here and there frozen and snowy.
Temperatures fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should grow warm gradually.
Snowfall in the region stopped, only in the lowlands small layer is lying.
But the Erzgebirge ridges around 30 centimetres of snow lies.
From the information received from regional road workers, it became known that lower visibility because of fog was places.
Skorostnoye road R6 and road of the first class is penetrating the region without restrictions.
But attention is needed, for example, bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All roads relating to the second and third class, including mountain routes are attainable.
But on some of their areas remains frozen and places of old snow still lie.
Especially attentive should be on the roads, located on heights.
Pardubitsky and Kralovegradetsky edge
The office of roads and highways of the Czech Republic on the Internet pages informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and highways located on heights, may there is a worn snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can be formed especially on the heights of Pardubitsky edge.
Ice may be about Lanshkroun, Usti-nad-Orlitsi, Polichki, Svitavi or Visoke-Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
Road I/43 i I/34, located at Svitavi are handled by chemicals.
Especially snow lies with Krkonoshe's roads and Orlitsky mountains.
Old snow is on the roads, located on heights in areas Rikhnova-nad-Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Czech Republic today partly cloudy without any precipitations.
Temperature usually range between minus three to plus one degree Celsius, a breeze.
Plzensky edge
Roads are under Plzensky region this morning, but in places it should be careful and adapt to the weather.
It is frosty in the morning, temperatures range from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and the subsequent cooling in some places it could be slippery.
In places drivers could face mist, but appearances will gradually improve.
Information was provided by regional road workers.
Highway D5 is attainable now practically without limitation, however, the governors of the road recommend to be careful between 80 and 131 kilometer.
Most of the road in the first class has a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Plzni and Takhov frozen sites may come across.
Roads in the second and third class moist, and in this case a warning about the possibility of a slippery sites work.
Drivers have to be careful, especially on seldom used roads around Shumava.
Olomoutsky edge
Drivers going to the heights of Olomoutsky edge should now see snow bunting on the road.
It remained after using chemicals in the Chervenogorsky saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krshizha.

Other areas of the roadside are usually pass without restriction.
"On Shumperk's heights snow remains lie.
Drivers heading towards Esenik should indicate that snow bunting in the Chervenogorsky saddle ", the base of shumperksky managing roads reported today to CNA (Czech News Agency).
At night on clearing roads their colleagues from Esenik went well, they assured us that roads to heights after treatment with chemicals remained naked and wet.
Roads are penetrating Olomouc without restrictions, but in Shternberke drivers must be careful on the patches where humidity remains.
Ustetsky edge, Liberec edge
This morning road workers from northern Bohemia report that remains a little difficult passing places.
According to information from a police database, and several places with ice or dropped-out snow, the mountain road to the site from Telnitsa on Klinitsa in Ustetsky region is closed.
The temperature has been negative in the lowlands, so on the roads snow and ice remains. In the lowlands, particularly southeast of the Czech Middle mountains, on the contrary, no problems are present, dry roads in general.
About complications on roads it isn't reported.
Road workers report on the appearance of ice in Shteti's surroundings.
According to meteorologists, for his education ideal conditions were created at night, the whole day was the rain and snow thawed, at night the sky cleared up and freeze began.
It is reported adverse conditions on the main roads and on the track I/13 on the border of Ustetsky and Liberec edge.
Because of the branches of trees on the road curved under the snow, were forced to close the road in Telnitsa on Kninitsa.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to save up positive energy
What do you think that in less than a month there must come the end of the world?
It is only one of the many disturbing news on which humans so easily come across.
Together with The Tap Tap group we constantly joke on the subject and we say that we are the only group in the world that will be able to collect relatively positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give a unique three concerts at the end of the world.
You could have more to say about it to readers?
It is a matter of national fund-raising activities that we plan for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential that the calendar Maya that end it is announced on December 21 at 11:10 has.
A day before the event, on December 20th at 21:00 parallelly start three concerts in Prague, the exhibition in Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, while on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean that time zone to 12 hours earlier than we will come to the end of the May calendar.
Who did this idea come to mind?
Initially it was my idea, then we all thought out together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public over the state in which we will take once the world to our children.
To mark the end of the May calendar we created a unique collection of objects from shoes and T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to give us support.
The Tap Tap group along with other musicians also completed the anthem at the end of the world that the end of the world is called "canceled".
Whether YouTube has already fallen in love to the audience the anthem at these benefit performance concerts will sound?
Of course, right at the end, if as a result, it turns out, and the world would not come.
It will be started singing by all artists at all concerts at the same time.
Anthems at the same time, will begin to sound also on the air of the Czech television.
Words to this song tomá Ganak wrote and played Jesus' role in the clip, is carried out by Xindl X...
How did you start cooperating with them?
We also work with other people of the Czech cultural life as we have a lot of charity events and concerts.
We try to connect them to these projects actively.
It turned out that much like to work with us, it is interesting for them.
That comes from a concert at the end of the world will go?
On the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year, we so work with civil association Tap at Edlichki's institute.
Teachers regularly students of schools of the Institute of Edlichki and hold with them fun and interesting events.
Students have no way to go to teachers, and we try to give them the opportunity in this way.
The project of additional construction of the Institute of Edlichki in the future will occur separately the building to which we will move with the project.
At each concert will speak some bands and performers.
That selection criteria were?
We tried to make the program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague Chinaski as Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, Tap Tap, Marjan Bango and Jerzy Sukhi will act.
About all the details you can learn on the site www.kpks.cz.
Do you any such plan "grandiouse action" in the future?
In May, we will speak for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would love to perform representation in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, really want to act in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics? ?
It's not so terrible as it may seem at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their carriages have to travel in the cargo hold, plus all the large number of goods and containers of tools.
Nevertheless, while handled it, without problems. The Czech airlines Č SA and the British airlines British Airways always perfectly for us were prepared to me how many times surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of availability, a relationship of the public towards disabled people and so on.
What do you faced by now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than ours, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow there are a lot of barriers, and here in surprise Independent Travel, a man on an electric wheelchair in the city centre is still.
And there not during such basic things how to give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there were already public organizations who try to draw the attention of people to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we always have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are many things that level of performance far behind.
But it is important to point out that improvement always depends on the efforts of those people concerned.
In London and Madrid it is normal that people with severe disabilities independently move on the streets, can go to the toilet, in a museum and elsewhere...
What a large number of people with disabilities, we are actively engaged in public life, it them with The Tap Tap a bit is not very common we promote!
The respect of the public or accessibility is one thing, but at the moment when among us there will be known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things really begin to change.
While it is isolated cases, strong-willed individuals.
The Tap Tap group is very popular now, but we will return for two years ago that in 1998 you caused him to arrange?
I entered Edlichki's institute as a mentor, around me, there were many young people who wanted to do something.
And as I am a musician, and I play including saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our leader Ladya Angelovich says, it gets out of control (laughs) a little.
Popularity came only in recent years, or I confuse something?
It is true, we were helped by that we began embracing the famous singers and actively working on group propaganda.
We concluded that the work that no one can estimate, in fact it doesn't exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Whether it was you a goal so well to promote their Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt like their potential in the ability to do something unusual.
In the entertainment industry is full of things, imitating one another.
It is logical, all new is taken with caution, and it lasts long.
There are few things, but I dare say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression at the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it is natural...
But the pity is completely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not any suffering and all abandoned persons for whom we have to feel sorry.
They are people who can live a life and develop, of course, only on condition that they have the resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something turns out, it is a shift not only for them, but for society.
If given the success you strict head that you are considered by many?
If we want to do the work properly, we have to be uncompromising in many things and hold a certain discipline.
But I think it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic representation and fly in the clouds and to learn that twice a week, they must go to rehearsal, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the way, very quickly losing enthusiasm.
But it is happening in any group that wants to work and something to achieve.
Now as part of a Tap Tap group twenty people.
How much they were at the beginning in 1998?
Only one entering Angelovich.
We open group, people come and go, it cannot be prevented.
For those who desire and will power, our doors are open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at Incheba stadium, in Brno in Fléda club and Ostrava in the Plynojem centre involving 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
In concert end all three cities connect a teleconference at the time of the performance of the song of The Tap Tap "the world Is Cancelled" the group.
The purpose of this project is to raise funds of 25 million kroons to buy a multifunctional barrier-free equipment for an educational center STUDEO at Edlichki's institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 czk for children under 12 years admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week at the ministerial meeting of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from former Eastern bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ECA on September 12, 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ECA in 1994 and in subsequent years, took an active part in a number of projects of agency.
But space Poland started your career much earlier.
Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, lecture of A. Shternfeld who presented on 6 December 1933 in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from the innovative work "The introduction to outer space".
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left audiences indifferent, after several years Shternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France Shternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltri and andrè Luis Hirsh's award for "The introduction in outer space".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899, 1966) about whom mentioned above, has become a great promoter of astronomy and space later.
He published in the Polish magazines, hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known advocate for outer space, and his contribution was estimated including that one of the craters on the opposite side of the Moon was named in his honor.
In 1925 in Poland, the railway section car equipped with a rocket engine was built.
Unfortunately, the author of the idea remained unknown, as well as project details.
It is not clear even to disperse or to stall who the rocket had to be used.
Information on this section car is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery started thinking about the missile arrows.
The study was conducted by Section of the equipment of arms in cooperation with professors Mieczyslaw Volfke and Gustav Mokzhizki.
From the remaining material you can see that studies have reached a stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German armies of work were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press there was an idea of the photovoltaic missile fighter, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and next year there was a work "The air missile torpedo- and aviation rocket bomb" the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotsky.
Both projects have been developed for military use rocket engines.
Before the war by all the projects of military use of rocket technology the Interim Scientific Advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) that agreed on the work was doing.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the war.
The next scientific work dedicated to outer space, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of Polish society space (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time society mentioned in the November issue of 1954 of the Problemy magazine in which four volume articles on space are published.
In one of them, a professor of M. Subotovich offered to organize society that are in space science.
At that time already projects of artificial satellites grew, and it was clear that space exploration is promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956 Polish society space (PSA) tried to enter the international federation of outer space (established in 1951) and in the fall of POA become a full member.
And next year the first president of the POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 a 1959) became the deputy head of the International federation of outer space.
At this position, it was the most death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 of POA made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological RM missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) that became the first Polish rocket, which has made a scientific study.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957, and the first going-live was on 10 October 1958.
The missile, capable of overcoming a distance of 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, the advanced RM-1A version was built, and in the summer of 1959 on the Bledovsky wasteland tests of a two-tier RM-2 missile is carried out.
This missile was at length about 1.4 metres, and its weight was about 11,5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was able to deal in the real scientific work - RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 kilometers, and the supervision of the high-rise wind was his task.
But in 1962, the further development was suspended.
The Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965 became the successor of the first RM missiles.
The rocket was conceived as a two-tier, its overall length made 5-10 cm, and initial weight - 32,5 kg.
Three types (described as the Meteor-1А, 1B and 1C) that was different with the chamber size for the scientific equipment were developed.
The Meteor-1А rocket had space of 0,4 l, Meteor-1В - 0,34 l and Meteor-1С - 0,62л.
The maximum range of flight all three types had 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 in Aviation institute hosted the development of Meteor-2 rocket and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring the payload weighing 10 kilograms to altitude of about 60 km.
Then Meteor-2Н versions and Meteor-3 were built.
It is worth mentioning also Poland's accession to KOSPAR (the Committee on Space Exploration) in 1960 and KOSPAR national committee created in two years later.
In addition, the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second Vladimir Remek's interkosmonavty ambassador.
Repeal the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional court overturned the law on public works.
The resolution has created lively discussion in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at these issues from a broader view.
Liberal focused economies in the EU, as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact this means that separate economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.
It is related to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered private capital flows with rampant financial speculation.
A significant difference in labor costs (wages) has caused a price tension.
It is necessary to understand the state where a producer by giving cheap goods tries to stand in the economic competition that "pushing" the cost of a competitor in order to take up a large part of the market and thus increase their own income as the concept.
On a massive scale it means for most entrepreneurs or production transfer abroad, or cheap purchases, or extinction. As a result, unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with others, a high increases.
As a private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including unemployment making inevitable costs of the state for the social needs grow.
As a whole, the situation reinforces the reluctance of gentlemen businessmen to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the public economic and social damage caused by them in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Off-hand methods of private capital create at the level of economies of individual states at a time when governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially lower social level of the population to bring to the country of foreign capital.
In other words, governments give their own population of abuses to the private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in current law changes.
The goal is economically to force the ​ ​ people to obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
It works as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time, serves as a tool to reduce the rights of workers in the field of labor laws.
As a result, the poverty rate, at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor increasing.
In Germany some years, there is a public distribution of products poor who are unable to support his own work.
The number of these people already approaching one million.
In improving the competitiveness of German economy constantly there are cases when hired people receive such pay that the state must pay extra to them that they receive a living wage.
Similar scandal became known the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures almost certainly bring in all southern EU states in addition to the state in which the people who are under pressure from catastrophic collapse of the social status, need either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist for pitiful salaries margins of society in the hope that someday the private investment capital will come to the country.
But it is requested, from where it will take?
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or it will not come in general since the Chinese, Indian, the Brazilian, Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still works for a share of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its economy that the controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital has persisted that the state should stay current promotions to the economy.
It should be further answer the question of whether private capital, which is now almost the policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes work?
A particular answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of nearly omnipotent and ubiquitous true-hands in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation that is showing in corruption, achieve mutual benefits, the law, almost all deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries because of lack of funds charge the development of the bill to private law firms that are closely linked industry.
Then the bills approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people as the constitution of the western type said, and from the financial and powerful groups that favor their own interests.
It is clear that liberal oriented democracy now quickly appears in such ​ ​ situations as described by Appian in their work "Crisis of the Roman Empire in Caesar and Pompey's Days": "The state breaks up for a long time, and agencies are involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal gain favor with stones and swords.
The bribery and corruption flourished without any ban and люд went to the election with in advance sold voice ""... decent people did not stand at all to the position of the governor ultimately once the state for eight months without consul ". . "Seriously started saying that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need for the choice of energetic person". Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but Caesar who ultimately replaced democracy with autocracy was him.
As in ancient times, in modern society own reckless interests without public interests prevail.
Private equity already essentially is not intended for use in a public purpose.
This result does not differ from the past: unprecedented decline of the elite without any efforts to reform of deeper.
The cause of fascist and Communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economies of 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, lack of these regimes and the availability of democracy of liberal type can be seen as a pause after which the next round is expected.
First of all that the current elite ignores effects in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social ills that we now see, along with crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and modern history is tragic.
Repeal the law on public works is not the solution or at least not forever.
Under pressure of competition, at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for ways to further cuts in social level of the population.
This trend is systemic in nature.
The decision is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen individual share of the state's economy will strengthen the role of citizens in government and will weaken monopolies of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos laboratory.
"Violence fails, and may never leave" - Sting, the song "Fragile" where the main verse chorus are words: "We don't forget that we fragile".
"If my sons didn't want war, they would not be" dying Gutel Shnaper, Meer Amshel Rothschild wife.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza Strip, as always, caused a lot of feedback.
One play for Israel, arguing its position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing it is racism of the Jewish state, the genocide committed on the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel, the role of a terrorist state is.
I don't want to reflect on who in these recurring waves of murder is a criminal and who the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and violence beginning did not witness.
My goal is to invite readers to look behind the curtain to see the one who first 95 years that has lasted tension (including from signing the Declaration of Balfur in November, 1917) on a small ground of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning are buttressed up historical by facts, some of them are made on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a power struggle history.
We can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon in every era.
That is not clear whether always these people completely independently took the steps, or behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to promote goals.
We should assume that we live in a time when the global wealth is concentrated among a few persons, and that this concentration of money and power emanating from them could not happen for a generation.
One that could be considered as head of the octopus (I don't know if there is someone above them, but it's possible) is distinguished from astronomically wealthy families - Rotshilda.
Of them don't write a lot.
Of course.
The first news agency (Рейтерс) they bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop the rumors linking them with criminal action in higher areas in which shadow they were and which has always led to strengthen their power, accumulation of wealth or both that and another.
They have significant equity stakes in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they have a share, they were fighting or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were five countries, after Qaddafi's ouster has only four, but at the same time the Russian government has taken the country's central bank in hand).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for Rotshildovsky of Bank of America, during the civil war he started producing its own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. The deputy Luis Makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Federal Reserve for setting of the Great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for a world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of the plan of three world wars created by the great mason of the 33-th level by Albert Pike.
The destruction of monarchical states in Europe was a problem of the first war, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third is to reduce the world's population to about 0,5-1 billion (so many slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume many resources), creating a single universal religion (the ecumenism cannot be anything other than as a precondition for the project) and eventual capture of absolute power.
Method by means of which the group of the richest families led by Rotshildami works, the call of crisis and the subsequent offer of decisions (order ab chao - an order from chaos) is.
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deteriorating situation (see the basis of FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
So, after they managed to launch World War I through the murder of Habsburg successor of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia, inaugurating the bolshevic revolyutsiiya.
World War I ended a sudden, unreasonable in the military and economic relations with the surrender of Germany (there was no longer a need to fight for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a collapse of the Central European authority, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate unleashing the World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, having imposed on Germany huge war reparations than created a prerequisite to radicalization of impoverished masses, then it was necessary to throw only to the Germans strong enough, exposing guilty and a leader in offering simple solutions, further to create multinational czeckoslovakia with strong German minority that was to play, and indeed played function of the fifth column, when fuel fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century Rotshilda provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, which one branch sought to create the Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour above declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with local Arab population started happening.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler from chains in which he was initially by bankers, or all escaped that he did was planned, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps set the stage for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and just as Germany was triggered by war reparations to the second world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to establish a center of the War of the third.
If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, become a victim of operations on the front lines, now with Arab or in other words, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is as if huge laboratory, a strife and chaos source not only in the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who are guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where the offence causes offence in the endless chain of violence if it all started with greed of individuals and their desire for a world power?
Here we need to distinguish between ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we, the international bankers palm off on people to vote in elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers a politician, doing everything to go to war with Iran, which, thanks to membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan... ) would threaten to develop into the world conflict, and given the containment of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz contained 20% of all the world's oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In that light the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 are revealed: "What we need is a general crisis, and people will adopt a new world order".
The new world order in their view is the world of Lord and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where each born body at birth implant the chip with which it is a creature in total control.
"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on the right hand or on the forehead brand, so that the person who is not marked by the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could not buy sell.
Here's the wisdom: Anyone who has a reason, can calculate the number of an animal.
Because it corresponds to the name human, and the number six hundred and sixty six.
Film "Operation" jargon ": When worse than ever, cause Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd of Islamic students demonstrators stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and taken hostage 52 diplomats.
They had to be released in exchange for deposed the shah Mohammed Reza Pekhlevi running after the revolution in the United States that have been a protector of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not assumed she could not afford to throw the shah overboard because it fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But to reach the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it could not.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free hostages force later.
The put diplomats were eventually released 444 days later, after talks mediated by the government of Algeria.
Their fate caused houses a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
Defeat in Iran contributed mightily to Jimmy Carter's defeat on the presidential election in 1980, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film directed by the actor Ben Affleck "the Operation" jargon "describes one of episodes of the story brought to America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After a difficult peripetias they finished the way to residences of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, the extravagant legend of cover, according to which they left according to the Canadian passports as members of the film crew who were looking for in the country a place to shoot a science-fiction epic thus helped.
Mix of genres
The plan, which was invented by the "evacuation" expert Tony Mendes required cooperation in Hollywood.
That the legend was reliable, in trade magazines have been written about the draft of the film, press conferences were organized, the fictional production company had real office.
Operation details have long been kept secret, the film is based on Tony Mendes's memories.
Affleck's movie is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film, the film opus", the history of the successful invention, cheating is an example can be a number of films about Ouchene's friends.
In the film sentiment - on the one hand, documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (in loans sign historic photographs of events are shown and how the same situations were shown in the film, big differences in it are not present) constantly changing.
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood fragments that cross with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating table, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck wonderful managed to make career restart.
From the mocked actor became a respected director, and his game has become the object of ridicule.
"The operation" jargon "his third feature film, after the dark detective" Farewell, Child, Farewell "(2007) and thriller" City "(2010).
At the same time, it is the first film Affleck not shot in the hometown of the director at Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place so belongs to the qualities that exalted earlier movies of the director of the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in "jargon" where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film happen on the streets, on the reconstruction of real events - opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with the clarity that also conveys emotions of confusion and emergencies arising when somewhere history suddenly changes.
Affleck and his colleagues reached a similar effect in scenes fictional (fake staff on the Tehran market).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with that story does not take lots of exciting scenes of cinema value.
It has successfully work with the little, sometimes something cums thinking - there's all this is not as elegant (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, the pursuit on a runway look enough artificially).
The lack of "jargon" is the distraction caused by the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman as Hollywood colleagues are very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they in the film is not the only.
Affleck's movie lacks a little dramatism, this is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, estimating statement and retrostyle recreate thrillers Seventies.
But is hardly.
However, this is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense, living history, as well as a testament to how the ideas of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are exaggerated.
The rules of inflation of balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com annually leading survey about the most absurd bank fees, decided to announce now competition "the most absurd resolution or the project from the EU workshop".
"We were moved by the latest development in which the EU plans to admit a 40 per cent quota for women to the administrations of major European companies", the organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager told "Right".
Among the book has already put forward for the nomination is the recent decision by the European Court of the Association of the amount of insurance premiums for men and women.
Yet women have benefits for life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively less at risk.
"From the EU workshop people can make further unlikely ideas to competition until the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013 ", Nager said.
Controversial orders of the EU is, for example, and binding adding biocomponents in fuel that as a result harms nature, as well as a ban on use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the directive on the cell size for chickens, which this year eggs significantly rose in price.
The de facto ban on using the term "sandwich-type oil" or seized from the sale of classical bulbs had been criticized.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European device often makes the decision under pressure of this or that trade or industrial lobby positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even threatened veto defends the requirements of the banks).
The interests of the margins are as follows: for example, bananas are of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach length 14 cm and did not dare show "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission has come true that only harmonizes existing separate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite resistance from some states, but softened its standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that the existing guidelines will lead to waste products.
A candidate for the prize in the survey can be and the last year's resolution of the EU, according to which sold air-balloons should be provided with a warning that children younger than eight years cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU turned to the American research, according to which air-balloons at games are a potential cause of death among children with asthma.
This restriction now extends to children under 14, which are forbidden to hit in the exhibition horns.
Funny ideas are born at home
Quite absurd and rules on European officials: Anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should say, not "FYROM" (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "Principle of non-interference" (Laissez Faire) offered to vote, and several above this absurd rules, for example, the rule of the EU on the amount of food in the territory of the member state.
The EU imposed the maximum amount of food supplies that can be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of her accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, a set amount of canned mushrooms, for which he had been threatened by a heavy fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire asked also by the idea to pay some countries that they have no sea, and the idea of grants for approval to receive subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, rather than in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
Let's ask the European Union for compensation ", Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw Palas (CHSDP) that time stated in the fall of 2004.
As an argument he pointed out that there was a big grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interference purchases, the state should have full warehouses of shares that had to be removed.
For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European commission has moved into the Czech Republic, granting the bidding for grain purchase from the countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies were offered villages by the Ministry of regional development, directed by the minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU) in particular such subsidies had to go for filing an application for grants of Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are an exception
Although resolutions in member states easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation and more effective functioning and European Union development, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
Serious problem, according to experts, the cherpaniye EU subsidies on projects that have no hint of something in common with deeper European integration, but which member states achieved by budget debate.
Causes emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identity of the traditional products, she was not always wins in this competition.
While the Czechs after six years of fighting, with Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomoutsky Curd Cakes" but "Tuzemsky Roma" that tradition in our country are rooted in the 19th centuries, our producers had to rename on "Tuzemak".
Products from reed distillate, instead of sugar beets can be called Roma.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous Carlsbad crackers, pogorzhelitskiya and T  ebo  carp and zhatetsky hops appeared "feta" and "gorgondzola" cheeses, marcipan from German lubek or Parma ham, already, for example.
Also Pardubice carrot and gorzhitsky tubes can be proud of the trademark of the EU.
People want I saved the republic, but I'm a fan, Okamura claims.
Mr. senator how a man comes to mind running for president?
I don't think that most to become a senator or president.
If us in the country all function without problems, I anywhere would not stand.
But I can't look any better because over the past 20 years the country is looted as thieves here hustle, people raise taxes and retirement.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I try to find a solution How to change it.
And as I was 40 years old and I am an independent person than any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the senator or president.
You get to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you turn the back to people who have chosen you?
I said all the time that I will join in the fight for the presidential palace, depending on the outcome of elections in the Senate.
Later I pointed out that if I will be selected as a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool through which I can carry out their views.
So I need the greatest influence and the largest powers.
But the difficulty not only that we as a nation nagging at ourselves in a bar or at the TV, but they are ready to crush anyone who will try to change something.
To the media, which demonize the person and confuse freedom of speech to freedom of lies are added.
For example, about me said I embute journalists, or that I was Jerzy paroubek said's advisor.
Let's go to your views.
For the presidential palace you started fighting theses about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of declarations of assets worth over 20 million.
What to do it, it is necessary to change the law.
You as president of such powers not, and only the rest of the senate can offer laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied that holding a excursions became free enterprise, he managed to be promoted.
The problem is playing politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately obstructing, which discourages citizens.
As an independent non-party person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage that I have no party unfolding on the shelves, without regard to exercises can take what is best for our country from each party and to apply it.
Are you the person more related to the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people carry me quite to the left.
For me it doesn't matter - a bit to the left or a little to the right.
For me it is important that we went forward.
This does not mean that someone is right, and someone left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good decision for society, will offer its KPChM or GDP, and I in the same way will be against a bad idea.
You are angry when someone says you a populist.
But you prove what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you have any ideal purposes and views.
And you try to approach it.
You can call it populism, but all offers that I say, already operate in the world, or prominent experts say about them.
But without the parliament are you still have only slogans.
And with it in politics you trainling do not hold.
Or did you think when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize Criminal liability?
I have no other choice.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to win them over what we achieved.
If I was elected president, would not be a problem to organize live television broadcast in which I will address the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they in case of failure, will have to say why they don't want.
If there is a strong personality who will sound abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections are there was pressure credit from the public.
I say directly that I am a fan, not a genius, and not the intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I only a newie in politics and for the program will try to gain majority support.
I put I try to promote yourself; If it does not work well, in six years I've finished and I will return to the private sector.
That's part sounds as if Okamura must save the Czech Republic.
I not saviour.
I know that one I will do nothing, so I went around a number of famous people with an offer to stand up for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
And I at least supported the journalist Ian Lorentsova leading the investigation who opened fraud with light fuel oil products.
I proposed a candidate because people really are not satisfied, but now I feel at stake.
Sixty percent of people did not go to elections, and most of those who went elected representatives of establishment.
Us independent in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that changes will be difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for his views, for example, for direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of his own party?
I didn't think of it because I have no time to check the purity of the last each potential supporter, and I have no money.
There is no money and for presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You have no money?
You talk about declarations of assets and how your own affairs with it?
The personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a site in Prague, worth about 25 million, an apartment on 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art around 10 million, Aston Martin by 3.5 million and Shkoda Superb per million, and some of millions more on the account.
By the way Aston Martin I came because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who went by the car, was brave with women and at the same time have attemptd pettiness and lawlessness.
You go by Aston-Martin, proanimatedy 60 million and you have no money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but their own money in particular I don't want to invest.
It is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million on campaign.
I have to go into debt?
In the campaign I invested already 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the election campaign from the pocket.
Spending on campaign to me in fact will be covered by the Senate salary.
But on this money I would not live, for example, could pay to his son for English school, which costs 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to make money, so anywhere would not stand.
Means, then you will carry on business that it was possible to live?
Did you not say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the wages.
As I promised, I partly reduced their activities.
For example, my deputy becomes managing director of travel agents in the spring.
People would like that I was an unselfish person who will keep the republic.
But I also need to do something for a living.
How many how the businessman, you are used to receive monthly?
From two hundred and four hundred thousand that I get on.
And if I became president, the business would finish.
You will find the full interview on Saturday issue of the newspaper "Right".
The architects of MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only in the imagination on the example of Spijkenisse and its newly built Book Hill - 2 Pictures
"The building seems to me fun, it looks futuristic, finally we again, you can see something interesting", Lizette Verkhayg, pedestrians on the edge of the road says.
And Stefan Spermon, information technology specialist in a large company located in the area, said this: "No, this building is indeed beautiful".
But I wonder: Why us today another library?
All have Internet, the iPad and electronic books.
Has anyone voluntary does not go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, low-remarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, is an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest levels of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact it was a few years ago decided to make a contribution to the general education and to build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro notes, in the form of picturesquely painted thumbnail of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then fathers of the city knew that they have only able to overcome statistics: to build here library!
Blame the Meuse in Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold column charts and the author witty, sometimes even cynical structures, to the task with his usual calm and appeared on competitive listening in 2003 with five books under the arm and a grin on his face.
And while judges perplexedly looked back and shrugged, audacious Meuse put from the original souvenirs/gift the illuminated by the size and finished his speech in the name of the project by the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here is my proposal: "The book mountain" in Spijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain worth 30 million euros grew.
It is part of a project of revitalization, which includes underground garage, the supermarket, mail and houses some adjoining to them and apartments for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November "The book mountain" was noted by the second prize of the competition "The Best Library of the Netherlands of 2012".
The plan also participates in national Dutch competition of wooden buildings of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb that could not offer at nothing but a postmodern pedestrian area and surprisingly ugly town hall, which white facades suggested the milk factory, got richer in a modern work of architecture.
But the most important In Spijkenisse was the public building of cultural first in the history of this small town.
Long road to the book
First impression: book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
Just one elevator held in the center of the store, because the true worshippers of architecture and reading will prefer to explore the area on foot.
The room glazed from all sides - light and easily foreseeable, floors from bricks and elegant street lights umistakably create a sense of public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
The look consiously seeks benches, dogs and boys playing football and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Usually bookcases stand along facades, and in the middle of this large dark room, usually uncomfortable and impersonal" is located, says Blame the Meuse.
We put a classic configuration of space upside down and pulled the zone to read from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is used wisely: In the centre offices, Internet library, chess Club, an environmental center and technical rooms located.
Especially please black bookcases that serve as decoration of walls, parapets and a staircase railing.
Their look, texture and smell are extraordinary.
Even experienced architects and civil engineers know it is for an unknown material.
"We have to work with secondary materials" - Jop Trauborst, project manager of the community of Spijkenisse, according to regulatory requirements explains.
Once at one agricultural enterprise in Frislandiya we met a suitable byproduct of agriculture.
Already there are many years in greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots artificial fiber material of millimeter thick attached.
It cheaply and saves time.
The delicate textiles serve out a couple of seasons after that, it might be thrown out.
For library this painting - for the first time in such amounts - was pressed into panel four inches thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) turns into a dark, single, strong material on a smell a little like new car and a bit sneaker.
On top conduct 105 steps.
The one who will overcome the way almost 500 meters long, will be rewarded in literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquets and wood ficuses in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and above all the right humidity on the literary mountain.
The costs of the new soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling warmth of the earth is used.
While the book mountain standing under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a while.
Wide farms from the glued wood, located across the glass facade, give a shadow and take most of the sun.
Climate indoors the very pleasant.
Other protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon mentioned above skeptic, from the field, have already visited new library.
Lizette Verkhayg also was already here.
And teachers of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spijkenisse, which lacked long ago".
Reason: A few weeks before the opening each resident received an invitation to offer one book from their meeting.
These books had to be empty slots on the shelves not yet complete library, at that time there were 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves are crammed up to the top.
"There is nothing worse than thin library" - the architect Vini says Meuse.
"I think thanks to our invitation now every resident somewhat related to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it was intended only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Spijkenisse wrote a literary history.
And even if they are very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for the creation of identity.
Sabot: "The Germans should play an important role"
Germany had abstained from voting on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the communications expert between US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany first clear that it would vote against the application of the Palestinians for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support the action of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it also does not support the US position.
Germany wanted to show their independence - without speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had abstained from voting on the introduction of a prohibited area for flights.
As a result of NATO carried out the proposal.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it was in the process of transformation of the foreign policy, namely passes from politics, so to speak, that the US, in fact, German foreign policy manageable.
In addition, the situation is compounded by the Europeans have no agreed-upon uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans once again be between the two fronts.
One is expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that while they just feel my role, but are on their way to "more normal" foreign policy.
To such foreign policy that carried out by France or Britain.
What the "normal" foreign policy from the German view specifically mean?
It is the willingness to take the position that does not depend on the position of the United States and the European partners in the national interest.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, which is on exports and communications with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany differs significantly from those of other large states and Germany has to defend its interests.
If the economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
First, Germany has major export markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.
She therefore needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communications.
But either way, it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans.
Whether Germany to a relationship with the US has much harm, refrain from making important decisions, such as vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don't think it was the same dramatic break, as in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even gain some respect.
It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that will have to reckon with its interests.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly supported the veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the United States and many European states?
Because of the American domestic politics these differences was always there.
I believe that the Obama administration at the heart has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly take this position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not so great at all, as it is always represented.
If you believe the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu will notice that Obama Netanyahu not so enthusiastic about politics.
Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think it makes the situation is difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans it would be a bit easier if there was a single, coherent European policy, but now it is not.
So they cannot act in a broader approach and are forced to work instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That's how they deal with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in the development of the European Common position.
It is clear that for Germany it is difficult, if only because of ties with Israel.
This subject has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans is clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - whether it will take a lead role?
Or the leading role hard is given to Germany?
Germany has not yet accustomed to it, it is always bad to him and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard is allowed to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time Germany suggests an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings are shown.
It is not easy to Germans to deal with it.
In fact, it is an old problem: You don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany is a much worse situation than the US.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinion, and it is difficult.
So, America's influence in European politics constantly weakens, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans would just have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like it, unpleasant or increases nelyubov for you, such is life!
Stephen Sabo, the deputy director of Transatlantic academy in Washington, the institute at which academics and experts-political scientists from Europe and North America jointly investigate the problems of transatlantic community.
In addition, the Sabot is a member of the German Marshall Fund, which specializes in German politics, US foreign policy and the transatlantic relationship.
"Protect trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is the Armani Polo?
The name entirely legally registered in China, which has nothing to do with companies from which names is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names will not make the claim.
But then it is unclear whether he will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners has become more difficult to protect the trademarks in China", Thomas Pattlokh, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing company specializing in violations of the rights to trademarks in the Far East says.
On my desk every week appears on new business.
Suffice it to simulators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register trademarks.
So, from Gucci Lu-Gucci turns out, rather than Prada Prada-Kny can register.
The same way the German companies, such as the producer of sporting goods of Puma are legally copied.
Pattlokh opens the folder with records of the Department of trademark registrations in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there Zegna DF Puma trademark, artificial name in which the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna is also used.
That Chinese - world champions in copying and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.
In big cities have multistorey department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
But put Pattlokh not so. At the request of the principals he acts against Chinese enterprises absolutely officially gained the right to use the name, which is already protected elsewhere from the Department of trademark registration.
Chinese call it "Banna минпай" brand passenger.
The word is associated with "Banna дакуань".
What they call women who hunt for the rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize guilt
"It affects business it is necessary to fight it" - Pattlokh is convinced.
"The trademark is washed away, a unique position is lost, image suffered tremendously".
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected areas are priced in millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the company at CLSA market research, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third in size and the fastest growing market for luxury goods.
But it is hard to achieve removal of questionable entries in the register of trademarks, and it is costly.
The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattlokh tells of cases in which the court rejected claims as after a long time, the protested name became "the reality of the market".
If a claimant does not carry, he even they will have to pay the plagiarist as damage to his trademark in China, Pattlokh says.
Sometimes it corrects the law of the jungle.
There are also well known cases of graphical elements.
In 2009, the Daimler company lost litigation with the manufacturer of construction Sany cars, a company that shortly before that got the manufacturer of Putzmeister concrete pumps.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo similar to a star of Mercedes.
A Geely company, which has bought Volvo initially used the blue-white logo recalling BMW; The process has been successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion products of Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, in which the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities would not read pleaded guilty.
The Department of the registration of CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 due to a lack of staff and premises to be so there was difficulty place.
But last year "The return of the emergency situation in workflow to normalcy".
Thus, the number of raw cases of objections fell by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57.000 such cases were closed, is 75 per cent more than last year.
However 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the department.
It is worth fighting is expensive
As it is very often in China, are impressive figures.
Last year in CTMO more than 1.4 million statements to protect trademarks arrived, roughly one-third more than in 2010.
It is a record and means that China in the tenth consecutive time led the list of new design around the world, reports the department.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 it was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If you simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth protesters it many times as many shows business of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the concern is fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts by was eliminated.
But the simulator secured Chinese rights to Freudenberg brand.
It was their own omission as the names in Germany are not protected, Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich said.
And the Department of trademark registrations of CTMO rejected the claim of Munichites.
However, in both following instances of Freudenberg won, but the other side continues the fight so far.
It is necessary to be on the alert
The question now is examined by the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to carry it on good end and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and away from us a lot of time, money, and nerves".
Domestic spending is unlikely to give in to the account, the archive of the company had to see even acts of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg without results suggested the other side "a large six-digit access amount in euros" for a settlement.
"This makes it clear as it to us is expensive" - Venttsler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to be thrown even Europe.
If imitators register there themselves. un-championed trademarks.
So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The concern long stopped production in these areas, but despite that could prevent registration.
"It is necessary to be on the alert" - Venttsler says.
As it, and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German companies to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international laws to protect trademarks, relatively foreigners are followed "by all that somehow it is worth protecting, recording in China" - Venttsler says.
Otherwise it could cost much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the brand will have to pay for the other side license fees for their own name, Venttsler explains.
Otherwise we will force out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: to foot tap, sing, help
In Heidelberg preparing chorus of Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans enjoy it.
History of the relationship distance over 8733 kilometers.
First the pritopyvaniye is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and male papuce select a step on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Raz-dva-tri-chetyre.
Only after that the voices of singers, viola, Bass slowly increase, tenor and soprano - they come, charm and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost does not jump out of the shoes made of canvas when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
The evening of Monday, in the music hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg chorus of Imbongi preparing a new song.
Fifty parties to the choir has come to rehearsal from 23 to 69, from an expert on the genetics of a person to Porter.
Obani's "min-amen-kamutef" "is a complicated thing, every voice of the choir has the text, in addition to a foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for their self-help
According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations programme to Fight AIDS, in the world about 34 million people living with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland lives 245 000 AIDS orphans.
With more than 40 per cent of the population of HIV-are positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in Esitzheni's village abcny votes for Africa found chiefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school in preparation for further study.
For 15 or 20 euros a month it is conceivable patronage.
This ensures the child money for school, school uniform and a daily hot meal in the Gogo-center.
Имбонги in the Zulu language the story or the eulogist means.
In this room don't speak freely on the bow, but are able to sing.
Nearly ten years choir learn songs in this foreign soft language and at times even brings them back to where they first emerged: on the South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Esitzheni that depends on the voices of German chorus.
Forty percent are infected
There are about 2,000 people some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among people there are a lot of children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died of viral ICh.
The disease of all Swaziland is reflected in Esitzheni in miniature: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest in the world life expectancy according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which was founded reduces the risk of infection 50%, among the population is not accepted almost.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland carry in a immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village on a joint tour of Africa in the spring of 2005, but before Imbogni's participants saw a lot of kids in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but also just a total of food, clothing, education.
Without schooling a man in a poor country has no chance.
At first it was a private commitment of individuals - for a few euros a year to send your child to school and to allow it once a day to get hot food.
But already a year later chorus based abcny "votes for Africa" that almost professionally concerns since then, of AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
What major sexually transmitted diseases?
To bacterial STD carry syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Frequent virus STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The pubic lice and itching, belong to parasitic STDs.
The main struck groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea meet mostly by men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch's institute acknowledges that a minimum in four of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transfer results from sex between men.
At heterosexual adults the most common sexually transmitted diseases chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in us relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are part of this group.
Among young people chlamydial infections occur much more often than among other groups.
According to the European data, three-quarters of all infections strike young people from 15 to 25 years.
We among young people human papilloma virus also popular.
How the cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are compulsory registration.
Incidence of syphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007 is shrinking.
In 2011 there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about on the one tenth is less than the previous year.
What are the symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
At the infectious diseases there can be ulcers in the genitals, complaints in the urination, highlights, pain in the bottom of the stomach and bubbles or consolidations.
But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How to be protected?
Condoms are able to reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide absolute protection.
After all, partially causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
So experts recommend regular monitoring, especially at the frequent changes of sexual partners.
In the early diagnosis can cure the majority of STIs and avoid the long-term consequences.
Patronat, donations and not least fees for performances of chorus across Germany allowed to collect something.
"We sent to Esitzheni already about 200,000 euros" tells Annetta Lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village from Germany Tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman manages money.
She also cares that orphans were well organized, such as one of nature.
Гогос as call Zulu old women, it is a village support.
Some of them come to themselves to 14 orphans, give them shelter and care that children in the form of every day in appeared at lessons.
Those who did not go native, arrive at an orphanage to Haniysila, a lonely woman who is paid salaries from the association, as well as two chefs who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, the association "votes for Africa" organized sewing school, built two Hyun homes and together with the American Association for Health Care for PSI organized analysis delivery on HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about a disease that is so evident in the country, prefer to be silent deeply.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is absolute taboo", said Annetta Lennartts - "because it is associated with sexuality".
Quite unusual in a country where King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy over democracy.
In particular, to a lifestyle authorized by the state the fault that virus ICh so spread rapidly in recent years and lies.
But it is also on stray workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every turn, says Annetta Lennartts, "but they don't use.
Other culture, the flesh to flesh ".
A little to support cultural exchanges, Ibmogni's chorus every two to three years is a trip to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and black consciousness that many in the south country in the black continent know since apartheid.
The bus full white, which is sung by songs in black language - such recognition not only put a good mood and joy, but even, sometimes caused tears in the face of severe border guards.
The trip brings into Esitzheni where singers visit sponsored children.
Although the village can hardly be found on the map in the Valley of the river Etsulveni it is more than known.
"Go to Esitzheni, light" - local people say.
And after 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg when chased singers come back to the rehearsal hall Bergkhaymer Street, you can see that light burns as well here.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that on the planet Mercury is ice.
The ice sheets can have thick 20 meters.
Space Department of NASA proved ice availability on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located close to the Sun, there also has a frozen water according to three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The probe "Messenger" found evidence that region of the planet continually in the shade is covered with ice.
Its thickness is expected to be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even to 20 meters.
Allegedly, water comes from a comet or perhaps the asteroid, faced Mercury.
No one connects ice discoveries with the existence of life on the planet, the adviser of the probe Sean Solomon said.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But these findings could help explain how water and other building elements of life has got to other parts of the solar system.
Enough to inhabitants of Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example "Phoenix" and explore the depths of the universe.
At times they send image Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from the camera, which was developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar system, as well as Tserer's dwarf planet.
As well as Pluto, which addresses around the sun for the Neptune, Tserera new definition of the international astronomical union in 2006, is not "planet".
This piece of infrared picture of the telescope "Spitzer" is "a family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it is more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" stars in a star circle.
This region of star formation - scientists unromantically call it W5 - "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years was initiated by a telescope.
This rosy heat of a dying star photographed NASA telescope "Spitzer".
The ring like a strength consists of a material that the star threw in the process of dying.
In a huge fog Trifid removed for 5400 series light-years from Earth, of gas and dust, there are new stars.
NASA telescope "Spitzer" took this picture of the galactic maternity hall.
The star congestion of the Galaxy, also known "the Seven Sisters" you can see at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope of color turn out better.
As the red eye winks at the observer the fog the Snail in the infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Similarity to the Earth continent brought to this fog Nick "North America".
The combination of a normal and infrared photograph provides an expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all the beauty managed to be photographed only through infrared sensors of the telescope "Spitzer".
Saturn and its rings: As they occurred is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It might be pieces of the moon of Saturn disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear pictures of the telescope "Hubble": galaxy maelstrom
Depending on the color reproduction pictures of spiral galaxies turn into a real works of art.
The picture released by the European Southern observatory shows featuring several thousand light years a nebula Trifid in constellation of a lead.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, growing) as dark strips of dust share a warm heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In Zmeenosts's constellation astronomers photographed a harbinger of space clash: At a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth of the core of two merging galaxies rush toward will each other and inevitably face.
Telescope "Hubble" removed the birth of a star in a spiral galaxy of M83.
The one who does not like technical reductions can call it nicknamed "Southern Lantern Wheel".
A photo of a space telescope "Hubble" shows a fragment of the fog of Iris in Tsefey's constellation.
The nebula removed for 1,400 light years away, consists of the dust particles that size is from ten to 100 times less than a normal house dust.
This image was made of optical and X-rays of various telescopes.
It shows a ring from the black holes, shot on 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was filmed for NASA by the space telescope "Hubble".
Big spiral galaxy scientists call was UGC 1810.
In this star fog there is an amazing group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle constantly creates new stars.
This star cloud connected to the fog the Socket, also constantly creates new stars at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright light on galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Research suggests that it has emerged shortly before the Big Bang when the Universe mostly there was a hydrogen.
Our views in the Universe: The most important telescopes
Perhaps the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey - before Galileo Galilei began one year watching the stars later.
Since then, mirrors of optical telescopes became increasingly - and spaces available to their look getting deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope to "Hal" it's Palomar in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror represented here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the US, "The big binocular telescope" is installed.
It allows to look into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has the huge internal device - the diameter of only the mirrors is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of "A big South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of depreciation.
However, in diameter, it comes to eleven meters.
The lack of an inexpensive design: the telescope is tightly fastened under a vertical corner is limits his mobility.
The telescope "Hobbi-Eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical corner.
The feature: high light gathering ability.
It reaches - despite a relatively small diameter of a mirror - options of the world's largest telescopes.
With radio telescope in Aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Participating in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence project (SETI), anybody with a computer can help by providing computing capacity.
View of the Observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) the Chilean Andes.
There is "a very large telescope" fully consistent with the name.
His four mirrors allowed to shine in a telescope even average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean astronomico of ESO installation European "a very large telescope" is also planned.
Its main mirror would have to be lengthened on the whole 42 meters - and will be made of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But photographs can be expected not before 2018.
Until 2007 both telescopes "Kek" on he Kea's Hawaiian volcano was considered the world's largest.
In two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters are set.
Telescopes "Kek" are part of the observatory of Mauna Kea, which, along with them is looking in the sky also through "Subaru" and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, Mauna Kea there should be a new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here they can admire illustrations.
However, the most important views from space are supplied by the Space Telescope "Hubble".
Since April 24, 1990 it oversupplies pictures of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" looking for planets outside the solar system - first of all such where life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets have been identified since the mission began.
In the pictures of the preparations of the space telescope "Kepler" are zapechatlit.
James Uebba's space telescope (JWST) will be sent to space not before 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of infrared space telescope has 10-meter-diameter 6.5 meters.
One of the problems of the telescope: It must all over the world the first stars and galaxies to look for the Big Bang.
Scientists think that in the South Pole of Mercury there is an ice.
But reliable data on it are not present as "Messenger" moves closer to the North Pole planets.
Radar measurements for decades, said that on Mercury there is an ice.
Thanks to the probe began in 2004 "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are confident now.
Drink oil every day - and live to 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan many residents achieve in the biblical way old age.
Here, there is even a longevity museum.
Solution search in a country where 97-year-old ancients seem still relatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan many residents achieve in the biblical way old age.
Here, there is even a longevity museum.
Solution search in a country where 97-year-old ancients seem still relatively young.
Through Talysh mountains can be called a trip wild and romantic.
A mini-bus carrying goula slides on the winding road, by the hills, overgrown with thick forests, crude streams and simple villas.
Everything is so green and bright that it is possible to think that you are in black forest.
But it is the most southern province of Azerbaijan, Iran's border is just a few kilometers away.
Live Here talishs is one of the people of the Caucasus known little, except that they are perfectly speak Farsi and azerbayzhdansky and different longevity.
Destination is Lerik.
A small town boasts too heavy architecture of the Soviet era that is not in harmony in any way with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come almost here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tiring.
On 323 kilometers eight hours as the road has only one strip leave.
The legendary wealth through the country is obliged to oil the Caspian Sea, here in the province, did not reach.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is sure to eat than interest tourists in Lerike.
"In May of Baku was famous for the festival song Eurovision - and next year we had the festival of the oldest person in the world" will take place, Fatulayeva says.
She is a director of museum of longevity is probably the only thing in the world.
Here's a biography about eight dozen talyshy of these places, which is documented more than 100 years. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, to him here 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he has given birth to another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov who 168 years were allegedly carried out.
Birth certificates, however, are not.
And given that the oldest man whose age is documented, 122 years old, Myuslyumov's age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973" - Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years at his daughter had been born.
Whether the shepherd Myuslyumov so added a couple of decades to the age?
Even Rembrandt Sholts, a researcher in the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about long-livers in Central Asia.
"A lot older people can be found in some parts of China, Japan or Hunz's valley in Pakistan" - Sholts says "in Sardinia and there are so many very old people".
But due to the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible because there were no lists of the civil status.
Every day glass of drawn butter
There is a fact that people around Lerik Strikingly often achieve biblical age.
Now here lives 20 people 100 years older.
Why here in the south, there are a lot of long-livers?
The azerbaijanian guide Fareed Mugimzade explains it with specific genes talyshy.
The director of museum Fatulayeva, by contrast, believes that matter in food.
Talysha love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink on a glass of drawn butter every day. But it is hardly likely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy in nutritional point of view.
Or it is a primitive way of life, which has up to people young? In Chengemirana, the tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoyev.
In 97 years it is still relatively young for this area.
Mirzayeva who claim that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with the oil dulo which tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and Mirzayeva's daughter, who already have long had grandchildren.
The nearby two kids jump.
In the kitchen for visitors prepare tea, served at typical pot-bellied Armudu glasses.
Mirzayeva has perfectly equal and strong white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long chestnut-colored CEP her son with pride opens before us.
I always wash hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept color.
"And I never used shampoo" - Mirzayeva says.
The monthly pension enough for life
She always ate only that grew up in their own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I never bought products in store.
Then she talks about her husband who served in the Army.
It was difficult after World War II.
But it was better when "the beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
Propaganda occurs frequently in a speech on the old woman.
But the cult formed around the figure of Father of the nation that had ruled the country as an autocrat in Azerbaijan is knows no borders.
It was in power until 2003, then the reins of government were adopted by his son Ilham.
Yet among the azerbaijanian old men there is no poverty.
(About equally same amount of the euro) Mirzayeva receives 230 manats monthly as pension, to local conditions is the sum for whom it is possible to live well.
And, perhaps, long ago Mirzayeva's grown son right: "Old men in our culture are held in deep respect".
They live in a large family, are loved, surrounded by the care and are happy.
Than no reason to survive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the constitution
Revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show deep divisions of the country.
Future constitution based on Sharia, met with fierce rebuffed.
Egyptian president did not be stingy with pathos.
We must create transition.
"And its success is on my responsibility to the people and before god", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but above all Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened mohammedans and secular Egyptians.
After all, all of them who still have been hopelessly divided in confused opposition, feel fear.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile at the mercy of powerful "Muslim Brotherhood".
Mohamed Morsi, without apologizing almost, said he temporarily cut off the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence "to save the revolution".
But, in fact, the 61-year-old engineer with a Ph.D. at American University of Southern California wants to rescue, is not entirely clear to Egyptians and the world.
Whether the judiciary will be left without power?
In fact 234 articles have been brought into the night 15-hour gallop with obstacles in the Islamic custom constitutional assembly from 100 participants, and this is partly raises fears.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings rely on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does it mean "principles"?
It has been and remains interpretation business, and it is possible to fear that Islamists would use the vague wording arising in connection with the legal люфт for stricter interpretation of Sharia.
At least one newly introduced article hints at him: in all cases of Sharia, needs to attract Al-Azhar University, the most important Islamic establishment of the country with great authority on all Sunni Islam for the council.
It should not, but may mean that the clergy oversees behind legislation that is de facto would have resulted in limiting the judiciary.
In the draft constitution a lot of things are subject to interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to military court should remain.
Those courts during Mubarak's power to serve the suppression of political opposition.
After the ouster of dictator in the military prison have 11.000 civilians.
Also, as indicated in the project, the state should protect "nature of the Egyptian family" and "to support its morals and values".
Legally it is formulated imprecisely that public institutions with this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature.
In clear it means nothing more than censorship.
No article does not create directly equality of men and women.
But another banned to insult and discredit the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But that such an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Doubtful the direction that "the insult people" non-smoking is presented.
There will be caricatures of the president or joke about his jurisconsult enough?
The matter of interpretation, like a lot of things, he said, will be introduced soon "in this project, which Morsi offers for a signature, and which Egyptians in a referendum.
"Revolution returned"
A few weeks, the opposition against the superiority of Islamists is formed.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unanimity in Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it will be able to enter into force.
"Revolution returned, and we will win" - Hamdin Sabbakhi who took third place on the presidential election said.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international department atomicenergy Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution the place "in the dustbin of history".
On the service of short news Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters of desire to head "coup against democracy".
"If he announced a referendum, we will go to the palace and we will throw it off", the opposition member Yasser Said said.
"We were not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not retaliated yuet", cited the Egyptian media of the opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to see the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well organized "Muslim Brotherhood" in turn, called for opposite demonstration, but from precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile before Cairo university.
A large number of women took part in it under coats and advocates of Salafis who shouted: "The people demand God's application of the law".
They demanded that Morsi: "Clear the country. "also assured: "The Koran is our constitution".
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all started, provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers, clearly, didn't want to take this risk.
"Muslim Brotherhood" said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear.
Is now time to allow people to solve time at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most of the project of Islamists, is considered it a done deal.
"The concept" human rights "not mentioned never"
Hafeez of Abu Sayed furious from this forced constitutional process, which generally had to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
48, a lawyer for Human Rights and president of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOPR) protected "Muslim Brotherhood" when Mubarak they were imprisoned or brought to justice.
Not because he shared their outlook, but because human rights for it are indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested for it.
And now the words "human rights" never met in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The expansion of the impact of Morsi on all three branches of government disappoints, a lawyer in the state.
These measures are a clear blow to democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil state, the de facto president cancelled" - Sayeda regrets.
Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with curiosity and Strain mixture.
For him, there may be payment.
The protester in Tahrir Square warned: "You create a monster that will not be able to control".
Norwegian rakfisk: the smelling fish is badly in the world?
At the five-million population of Norway one of the highest standards of living all over Europe and around the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country is somehow connected with local addiction to one extremely foul-smelling fish dish?
Take some become overripe pieces of cheese.
Place them in a lot of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You have the smell of rakfisk vivid sense of smell is one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies will succeed.
I am in a small town called Fagerness, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around the picturesque types covered in snow. It is very beautiful, but in the air the innate characteristic odor flows.
Rakfisk is the trout, salty and roaming in water to one year, depending on the taint need to achieve.
As twilight condensed and turns cold, crowds of people gather for the festival in Fagerness on this most let's say an dish.
"They eat raw and washed down with a shot glass аквавита, local caraway vodka" - Havard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and combined "the rakfisk general" who is holding a festival explains.
All around us people eat fish cut in small dice and wash her down with significant portions of alcohol.
"Like аквавит than rakfisk more" - Havard says.
This drink is able to break their smell.
I try a couple of slices.
If this can be by a piece near by, it's not so bad - a little different from a spot of land you long carried with you on the bus.
Rakfisk is the Norwegian product from different times, poverty times when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish presoaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water in the fall.
Then in the deep winter when fish now well and thoroughly began to ferment, her took and, having muffled perception alcohol, used in food.
For the last generation that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave the country to find work and to emigrate, mainly to us.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are made by immigrants who are drawn here by Jobs, high wages and developed the social security system.
Residents of Sweden (the old rival, and not long ago and more affluent neighbor) in high numbers come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, indispensable if somewhat foul-smelling element of the past of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, this is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds (14 dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most people in the country, it seems, is happy with this.
People here remain reluctant to mention Anders Breivik's name, racist and extremist right-wing, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, act of terrorism call "happened on July 22".
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's well-being of Norway growth (since the early Seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world is lying.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity", Anna, our waitress carrying trays with adult rakfisk, a woman with his long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes says, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are people like you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent English.
We don't like being being displayed, we are not capery.
Norway very carefully so oil - most of its profits from oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis when all squandered money that they did not, Norway is thrifty counted all costs.
"While it is possible to ski in winter and to go camping in the summer, this is enough to happiness", Anna said.
"There is also a rakfisk", she adds with the carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow in the queue behind any food - rakfisk I have had enough.
Here's a hamburger with losiny meat is exactly exotic, deliciously juicy meat.
But in the evening we wait for more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel perform a special dinner on rakfisk during which visitors set by a vote, the best, or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a direct air in that show a leader in the tie butterfly, surrounded by plates with rakfisk.
It's like a song contest "Eurovision".
"So the Thor Jürgen that mark you have given for the best fish there at yourself in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here is our assessment"....
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from his chair, possibly having touched аквавита.
Or maybe just breathed the smell of the fish.
The hard early career is necessary to Mexican President Enrique Peña Ñeto.
While the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto is going to take office, the BBC correspondent extend invites us to look at the difficulties that would face, and a mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Trafficking in Mexico City now in particularly woeful.
This city is overloaded with transport and the best time, since Monday steel obstacles cutting some key highways to the capital and causing chaos on roads were built.
But it was not to keep people to get to work from suburban areas and to prevent protesters to get to the parliament building.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto will put on a presidential line and will take the helm of the country.
She faces a difficult task.
Mexico has made good economic data from Felipe Calderon's administration, which now puts the powers, but the country mired in war on drugs, which in six years has already claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government claims to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence", Mr. Peña Nieto said earlier this week, US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White house.
I'm going to propose new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.
To such statements in the US president political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
On his homeland, in a densely populated and extensive staff around the capital of the country, views on the new head were shared.
Straightforward person
In the idyllic small town Valye-de-Bravo, for example, it fondly remembered.
People put it down to credit tourism revival, the development of the resort area and infrastructure.
You can reach the city on one of the new roads built by g-ohm of Peña Nieto, which are very different from roads with holes and holes previously on this place.
Plates with his name hang on a modern building of the sports centre and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We take from it the hopes of real and serious changes", the friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, congressman of the state from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) led by Peña Nieto said.
We expect a real and drastic changes that are so badly needed for our country, particularly in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera recognizes that after he was 12 years of absence in the presidential Los-Pinos palace the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Ñeto.
In addition, he dismissed the accusations of triviality that were brought to the new president by the opposition.
It is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of the embodiment of his vision of the future of the country.
This is a great statesman, and, above all, the person able to listen.
But the rest of the state many people had another idea of the former governor.
Belediye Nesaualkoyotl, also known as the name of Syyudad-Nes, is the clearest contrast with cobbled streets of Valye-de-Bravo.
Hidden beneath the platforms of highways, in many ways, it's the outskirts of the Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality also have severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year to suppress the gangs trafficked in drugs in those areas, troops attracted; and the violence against women has here is particularly acuity.
On the wasteland near an extensive dump only dozens of bodies of the murdered women in the past two years have been identified.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto is far higher than the equivalent figure in the city of Ciudad Juárez, which has sadly become famous for violence whose name is nominal when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, of him at best we can say that during his time as governor he failed to address the problem of femicide.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of complete disregard of the problem.
A resident of the concrete house similar to a lot of homes in the stalled area irenaeus Buendiya barely holding back tears, showing me photos of the late daughter Mariana Long.
According to the official version Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family will read that she had been murdered by her concubine.
"When I got her home, was like that, her body before it washed", Ms. Buendiya recalls.
There were signs that he had been beaten, and a body had already frozen.
Mariana's mother retells the story, and a portrait of his daughter looks at us from the wall where it hangs near the crucifixion on which only one word can be seen: justice.
This, according to them, this was refused to this family.
"Officials treated me like the old gossip unhappy with the violator of calm.
They want people just took believe everything they say, and kept tight-lipped.
But it is wrong, so it is impossible, especially when there are a lot of violations and defects ", she says.
By putting on a presidential line Saturday, President Peña Nieto with it will take hard responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico mentioned the crimes of violence, and the new president promised to make the problem, priority during his rule.
"I hope that he would be exactly the same president what was the governor" - Olvera, a congressman from Valye-de-Bravo PRI says.
But the family of victims in Syyudad-Nes are most afraid of it.
Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse, said charge.
Prosecutors try to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing highlighted Manning's stay in the military prison at Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of the conclusion of Manning were brutal.
The private of the US military accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that the private Bradley Manning accused of the largest leak of secret material in US history, did not use a lot of opportunities to make a complaint of abuse, which he said, he happened to transfer, while in military prison.
During cross-examination in pretrial hearing in Fort Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maryland, the military prosecutor major Eshden feign said records of weekly visits to Manning by representatives of the administration of prison in nine months of his detention at Quantico, Va., do not contain complaints of abuse.
Cross-examination in considering the request of the defence for diversion of Manning that his conditions of confinement were cruel and were themselves in sufficient punishment, was carried out the day after Manning said that while in detention, he intended to commit suicide.
The military specialist in the analysis of intelligence, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
They were subsequently published on the Internet site WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks website has not confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
During the hearing on Friday, prosecutor feign with Manning saw reports that had filled in after Manning's visits by the representatives of the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was on the terms of a high security of the conclusion from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits serving prisons asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor feign asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that estimates the contact from prison service "excellent" and the general conditions of detention "very professionally organized".
The reports do not contain any complaints of abuse, despite the fact that Manning explicitly asked about the conditions of his detention, feign claims.
Manning replied that he expressed oral concern about these problems and that officials visiting it discussed with him these problems and said that they will do, but did not fix it in writing.
"They recorded" problems are missing "(after discussing my complaints) but it does not mean that I didn't raise the subject in a conversation", Manning said.
A military judge, Colonel Deniz Lind, also asked Manning why that did not complain of illegal treatment in January 2011 during the meeting of the commission considering suicide intentions that it made in writing for a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that it removed the regime of "injury prevention" and relaxed conditions.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited mode of concluded-on is one level lower than the supervision regime for the purpose of suicide prevention, was introduced to protect the prisoner, and for the sake of the safety of others.
"I wanted to clear administrations that with me all right that they cancelled an injury prevention regime... The level of my life improved, from my point of view ", Manning said.
On Thursday, Manning testified to the arrest in Iraq and moved to Kuwait, where nearly two months before transferred to prison on naval base in Quantico, Va., in July 2010 supported him.
He said that the thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he fainted because of the intense heat.
He explained that is psychologically very tough when you don't clear how your fate is decided, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world shrank to base Camp-Arifzhan, the size of my prison, Manning said on Thursday.
  I thought I would die in this cell ".
In Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent much time in a small cell, at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, bedroom-slippers, some articles of clothing and points.
He said that tried to move, and how to sleep or even simply lie in the afternoon banned rules.
According to Manning, during sleep attention to it constantly was arrested by light permeative outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned over in bed at night, according to him, he awoke and forced to turn over on the back.
Advocaat Manning gave official objection against illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011 Manning transferred to the military prison in Fort-Livenvort, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning on the statement he made during the testimony on Thursday, that after once at night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to face naked security guards and other prisoners in the morning test.
Manning said he had no opportunity to be covered with a blanket in check.
In response to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard, which should throw a blanket with which it could be covered, but acknowledged that no one did not directly order him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said last night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that it does not threaten.
Manning reported that said the officer that they could use an elastic band of cowards or bedroom-slippers to hurt himself, but did not do so.
That night, under Manning's testimony, his underwear, bedroom-slippers and glasses, was taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least to consider that he had to worry while in detention, and will significantly reduce the sentence if Manning is convicted by military court, which is expected to begin consideration of its business in the beginning of next year.
Protection said that plans to offer Manning to admit guilt for less serious crimes, and to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of hearing is scheduled for this weekend, it is anticipated that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon argues that Manning was detained in Quantico under the rules governing the content of those arrested with the highest security.
Among the charges against Manning, the illegal promotion of publication of data on the Internet, the information on national defense, and kidnappings of state assets or documents are registered relating to aiding the enemy.
If convicted on all counts in the indictment, life imprisonment could threaten it.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the Mexican American.
According to the author, many Mexicans have been forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities to use themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country of hard times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American descent are torn between two cultures.
In a recent trip to Mexico City I passed along a corridor for the coming approached the zone of border controls and cold.
Signs pointed to two rounds: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), one for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I faced a few seconds, without knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and me all my life called Mexican.
It is just a code name as well as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped on a design "Mexican American".
But here I was in Mexico.
Here in the land of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex ideas.
I was just us.
I speak to ask quite well Spanish questions or to answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than when native-speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I got the American passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Ñeto visited the White house and met with President Obama.
Questions were on the agenda familiar for meetings of the two presidents: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president Peña Nieto eagerly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, through which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico rather than moving to the United States.
He wants to sign the treaty on partnership with the US and Canada, and to create some North American trade block like the European Union.
In addition, the president Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals did not sound.
For Mexico relations with the United States, a subject that was heavy and made of old scores.
Most Americans have never reflected that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of the territory.
But Mexicans think centuries rather than minutes and see reminders of what happened in all.
So any statesman of the US needs to mention, although criticism word toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society complaints that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbors are immediately distributed.
And Montezuma's descendants are filled with militancy.
The relationship of Mexico with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the US is the most difficult.
Want to talk about offenses?
It is enough of them.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for itself opportunities, and for whom this opportunity is not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio has a lot of people of Mexican origin for one reason only: At some point, their family history someone - a father or grandfather - was unable to find itself in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.
Most of them were Mexicans a certain type - dark, poorly educated, from poor rural families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, see differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and got a good job, but we cannot forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused, and is not clear, but we know what country to read.
The United States of America.
We also know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elites and the ruling class don't like us.
We answer them with the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as people of the second grade as artificial Mexicans.
We do not adequately speak Spanish, and our ties with Mexico not strong enough.
Our existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.
We would not find itself behind the silk curtains, finding in the US full life, but having lost spiritual touches.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US as a kid and it reminds me that between a real Mexicans and Mexican Americans, there are some tensions - Mexicans understand the national identity more clearly, and it is offensive to Mexican Americans.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, my many familiar Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but we love and Bruce Springsteen.
Get the best of both worlds, you must lose roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
And in the US, they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during the trip as if our relationship without that are very confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals, want to restore relations with diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and presented its interest to the United States.
We could tell the American friends about what is a beautiful country and it's great to visit him, and could convince political leaders to forge closer ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
No way.
There are too many offences in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking binge, many of us don't believe that the country is so perfect.
Sorry, but deal with it, амигос.
And it is fair.
If the part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States as they arrived with Mexico a century and a half ago, they should take and the fact that some Mexican Americans still in offence for the way most recently in Mexico managed with their relatives.
Yes.
Maybe we have more common than it seemed to me.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The Ceasefire Agreement between Israel and Hamas group can be a fragile foundation for further world
Whether the long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East is possible?
The next round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound, the increasingly familiar, meaningless disputes on the one who started the first; Many buildings are destroyed; More than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis were killed; for the first time during the conflict, released from the Gaza strip of the rocket fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
While the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in the eternal conflict, changes to the Middle East.
It is possible to treat it differently, but the events began to vortex generation "Arab spring" many settled realities in the lawless storm and Palestinians and Israelis have not been able to stay out of the vortex that rocked the region.
It is possible, as a result, their struggle even more bloody than before.
But there are reasons, venting hope for from the deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance the situation does not give reasons for optimism.
Even if a ceasefire, the agreement in which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, the clashes that have occurred this week only strengthened security officers from both sides.
Leaders of the Islamic Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will announce that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses suffered by them.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas increases the popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territories currently overseen by the more moderate Fatah.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
In the process of increasing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas has new influential and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, acted with Hamas support; Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic Gulf states followed suit.
Triumphant Hamas supporters declare creation around Israel with an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon in the north, in which the militant Hezbollah group, to Syria in which more and more pro-Islamic rebels had vvozdavatvot overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and further to Jordan, where the authorities of the king threaten allies of Hamas rules.
The most significant change in the regional balance of power has been on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Morsi movement influence the Muslim Brotherhood has become stronger.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator who was not paying special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is the organization in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism.
In future diplomatic engagement of Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice will not be muted even to Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "tough" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense of Hamas were crushed.
The Israeli anti-missile system "Iron Dome" justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the missiles to Hamas.
Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least any time.
As for diplomacy, the US to remain faithful to its permanent position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the final round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, particularly at the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that, since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by the rockets released from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall that comes through the West Bank - a significant part of the non-recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue expanding despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the elections scheduled for January 22 - teamed up with even more aggressive-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What sense to give the Palestinians and give them their own state?
When given in their drive all the power in the West Bank, whether it from there will be launching rockets toward Israel as it is done by their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise their heads.
Perhaps supporters of the "tough" line will win; But their calculations could be challenged in the Arab spring.
Though Islamists who came to power in Egypt and other countries, not the most warm feelings for Israel, internal problems be their priority.
The defensive part of the budget of Israel's more than in all its Arab neighbors combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less so, should consider long-term consequences of the policy.
As we approach for democratic change in the Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians in the right to self-determination is a ticking time bomb that will blow up sooner or later in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus, which has blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is growth of the Arab population is only exacerbate these problems.
For bloody operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip for Hamas suppression, it is necessary to pay in growing resentment of the international community.
Both sides need an external momentum
There is the only solution to that sensible representatives from both sides, and much of the rest of the world and our newspaper continued challenge: The two countries and the concession Israel of territory in return for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, hope that the ceasefire will enable other countries to influence the parties involved more effectively.
Egypt it is past time for them to make the decision to block arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have more than ever, better position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries also have to seek reconciliation of movements of Hamas and Fatah.
It would do more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote in the United Nations may result in recognition of virtual Palestinian statehood.
Its role in setting Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
In his first term, he did not submit its own peace plan.
After returning to the White house it still shows a reluctance to connect to address the problem.
It is tragically short-sighted position.
The United States is a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
It is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
In Australia and the law on standardised packaging for cigarettes came into force.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and the image of body parts delivered to diseases contrastly are allocated on a sad green boxes apply equally to all the brands of cigarettes.
The Australian law first world practice on the same packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and colors the registration of different brands by the same box of sad and olive colour with terrible pictures of the body parts struck with the disease and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking their parents.
Besides different images and inscriptions warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the packs imposed mandatory starting this Saturday is the name of brands that were printed with the same small print.
These are the most severe in the world of a condition for registration of packaging for tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia announced that the purpose of this measure, to keep young people from smoking, depriving the abuse of a fashionable status.
The basis of the decision was formed by the results of studies that have shown that the people, not start to smoke to 26 years, in 99 out of 100 cases and never have become smokers.
"It is clear that even at the most young children understand the sense that tobacco companies through packaging registration" try to inform, the minister of Health Tanya Plibersek explains, referring to the research that have shown that, for example, the crown in the logo associated in children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the proportion of smokers lowest in the world, so these changes will not particularly affect profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is considered already by other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry has resisted the new law.
Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and accessible cigarettes will be sold.
"The law will lead to serious consequences, other than that reflected his leaders", Scott Makintayr, a spokesman for British American Tobacco company in Australia said.
Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will deliver many more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, by contrast, new laws encourage business growth.
Sandra Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that demand for cigarette cases and the silicone cases hiding unpleasant pictures on packaging, soared (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case before the high court in Australia, where tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra H, Zico company has already sold about six thousand products to businesses of wholesale and expects new party.
For us it is good business.
The potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, popularity of social networking among the part of the population of these measures are aimed.
After the passage in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal advertising of cigarettes and support for sporting events, and which prohibit vendors to expose cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian government banned local companies and websites to advertise on the Web, but it cannot limit it foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products and you have only a small opening, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet will look to be very tempting", Becky Friman exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney explains.
Freeman notes the growing number of reviews for trademarks, ordinary users written by a person allegedly on such social networks, as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether the work of the ordinary citizen who love Marlboro cigarettes that he did not regret the time and resources is valid and made the video, or unless there is an advertising company?
The Australian office of British American Tobacco Company says in the industry are now more concerned with adaptation to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry were even such measures as part of Ukraine, Honduras and Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states made no claims in the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair to restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations to all those countries with Australia are very small.
The decision of the WTO is expected to the middle of 2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of their acceptance of such laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada, the first introduced mandatory placement of the photos warning about the hazards of smoking.
Now the rule was adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
The number of smokers in Australia pointedly do not believe innovation.
These pictures don't touch me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just pulling a cigarette and you hide a pack in your pocket", Victor El Jeyg buying cigarettes with a photo of a tumor in his mouth on the deck explains.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw is my little daughter.
James Yu managing a tobacco King of the Pack in the centre of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the problem of collusion of goods from shelves
"Earlier in my discharge of a new party hour, and now four hours left", he says.
"The government should take and totally to prohibit a cigarette, then we would say: what to do, all right, it's over, we are closing shop ", he says, throwing up his hands up.
Miss in the world of electronic networks and persistent connections so it's not too bad.
I suddenly had to spend five hours to this Thanksgiving at the airport because mechanical problems were found in our plane and it replaced by another plane that we and waited.
So I have had enough time for reflection on boredom nature.
I will not deceive you.
In the afternoon at the airport waiting for the flight, it's really boring, and here is not much help neither books nor magazines, iPhone, even duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and experts in child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss not so bad.
It forces the brain to distract for interesting related topics that may contribute to the creativity.
And how we are constantly in the modern world in front of any screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
We need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time is not.
We will return to it.
I used to, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times when people had more free time.
It is not is approved by Peter tuia, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University Calgary, author of the book "Fascinating History of Boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom can boast of very ancient history", he said.
On the walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions about boredom, dated found the first century.
There is open the question of how we understand boredom.
The problem is that, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada that the understanding and boredom vision often changed.
Having studied studies on the topic and asking a question to the task force in 100 people, the professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to this definition: Boredom is when people "want, but can't deal with that would put them satisfaction".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the missing man does not do anything that would like to do.
At opatija does not want to do.
The basic in experienced boredom, he said, it "violation of attention and the mood associated with this deterioration and a sense that time hangs heavy".
According to the description boredom may seem very similar to a depression.
But the professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these countries, missing people see the problems in the world and circumstances, and the people during the depression, see the problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that it's boring to us when it is difficult for us to focus on anything.
A study "vacant reason: boredom definition in terms of attention "published in September issue of the problems on Psychological Science journal, the professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the experiment had earlier which participants listened to record the voice reading a magazine.
Some participants had also heard loud sounds of the irrelevant TV program included in the next room, others heard the same sound to lower the volume level, so they could be sorted, and the third group only listened to record the voice without foreign soundtrack.
Those who heard the TV with low volume, noted that he was bored, more than others, it was difficult for them to focus, but they didn't know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, Mark J. says. Fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University Gvelfa, Ontario, and a co-author of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something not interesting, "for example, peering at the flow of products on the line in search of a marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom".
It is considered, he said that when people start rocking on a chair or to draw a churn out on a piece of paper, they do with boredom, however, we now know that actually doing so simply help not cool physically.
"The study found that children who aren't prohibit fidget and spin, learn better and more information than children from whom demand to sit quietly" Remember, the professor Fenske claims.
At some points, all of us test boredom: at a flight delay (as in my case) listening to the monotonous speech, viewing the uninteresting movie.
However, different people show varying degrees of tendency to boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers have developed to measure such specific features special "The scale of tendency to boredom".
To determine an assessment on this scale questions and statements, for example, "a lot of it are used that I should do, monotonous and monotonous" or "Too much is interesting to me, so nothing there is no time".
The researchers determined by such surveys that boys miss more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of various external stimuli says.
But as a whole adolescents in general often miss.
In 1991 Read Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, launched an experiment in which he had been in contact with the help of the messages with almost 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% jailbaits said he is bored at school and in the household chores and 23% said he is bored outside the school.
So only 3% of parents said that he was bored.
The professor Larson noted that he had no information on what would be similar data on boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "this is the share of adolescence, the peak of tendency to boredom", due mainly to children and adolescents do not address fully than to do it.
Let's go back to my initial question: Boredom is helpful?
Sometimes not, because in most extreme, this research shows that can push people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risk gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers reflected on the relationship between boredom and creativity, the professor Vodanovich who has devoted to studying the issue of more than two decades, says.
"So our brains tells us that we must do something different; It is also boredom ", Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University said.
But the brain doesn't always know what it is better to do.
If it is boring for you and you will direct this energy on playing the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
But if you want to watch TV, it is better for you only for some time, and will pass soon.
So if your child is missing and you give him the iPad, it will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom independently or in any way otherwise to manage your time and employment, the professor Fenske says.
"And such skills of independent regulation are involved in a variety of situations", he said.
Your child learns not only to occupy themselves himself with something, he also studies self-control in general.
I don't think the boredom should be praised in some way.
But to read it out something bad is not necessary.
You have to learn to feel comfortable even out of the constant stream of activities and technology on.
The professor Eastwood agrees with him.
"We see it so that we need to test more often boredom, and the boredom is an unpleasant, an unquenchable desire to do something meaningful", he said.
In fact, people tend to be disabled somehow of constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world we are accustomed to regular excessive stimulating senses," he says, "and when it is silent, we are lost and we don't know what to do".
It is unclear as the new law on marijuana legalization in Colorado would apply
Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado stands accused of committing a criminal offence that would be completely legitimate throughout the state soon: possession of a small amount of marijuana and tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco said that once in September he with friends in Lamar and went in the car on the prairie near the border with Kansas when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, to Mr. Orozco subpoena for drug possession and knowledge of adapting for drug use - small offences came, the penalty is due for each of which $100 - and date of the trial is ordered.
"With us are being treated as criminals", Mr. Orozco said.
But criminal?
As a result of uncertainty that comes weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, addressing hundreds of small litigation depends less on the law, how many on the viewing area.
Allegations of a small offences related to marijuana, are already removed in hundreds of cases, here and in the State of Washington, which took a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped demonizing those aged 21 and older for possession of small doses that they would be considered legitimate once in a couple of weeks the law will come into force.
However, more conservative areas of Colorado prosecutors decided to regard the current cases related to marijuana, and former hold for storage of the drug.
However, in some cities from the outskirts of Denver to mountain regions of the West vote to allow the in their places in the new stores licensed by any state on marijuana sales.
"All this is growing so quickly that I don't know what to expect further", Daniel J. says. Оутс, the chief of police in the little town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the authorities in the State of Washington is also puzzled scratch their heads.
They should make rules to determine the order of the licensing of growing, processing, distribution and marijuana sales, and all this must be made until December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, this is good or bad, promotes most other states in the settlement of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado better market, so they will serve as a good example" - Brian I. Smith, the representative of the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the State of Washington explains.
But no one can do more, Mr. Smith recognizes than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent by which we can be guided", he said.
The bill of the State of Washington called I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and for the year will cast staff into a state of uncertainty when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of the possession of marijuana is legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between a state law about "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana from a ban on trade in it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It will be particularly difficult to place the licensed facilities for trade in marijuana within the cities, especially in Seattle and its suburbs" - Ben Livingston, the representative of the newly formed research group "Center of the legalization of marijuana" explains.
On 21 November, the police chief of the Outs from Aurora sent to his subordinates by e-mail that the prosecutor's office of the city would not entail any more people who have reached the age of 21, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops, exposing people of these violations "from this time".
The police chief of the Outs reported that the police will enforce in the city of the rules governing persons, growing marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and distributors of drugs.
The prosecutor of the district Ueld in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, a more rigorous approach to this question.
After the vote on a bill he said that prosecutors will still be held accountable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage using her face to get medical treatment.
At the moment the charges of possession of two and less ounces of marijuana, although many of them charged and other violations are brought to 119 people.
"The duty of our institution - to pursue for the actions that are considered criminal at the time of their commission", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
Reaction was mixed even in places like Mes's rural district, where voters was rejected the proposal on marijuana legalization.
The police grand Dzhankshn, the largest city in the district, no longer hold adults to own a small number of drug.
The district attorney Pete Hauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss the charges on existing cases involving possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law until it will not change is our duty", he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of residents of Colorado, which voted, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the public and legal system will not be easy.
And contradictory reaction of people in different parts of the state naked ambiguity about local authorities to employees experiment with marijuana.
"District attorneys in this issue have a cultural barrier" - Sean McAlister, the Denver attorney who represented the interests of convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National organization to reform laws on marijuana explains.
"They long persecuted people for it that now cannot accept that it no longer a crime", he says so.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small amounts of marijuana are in the same as cocaine, is destined to become a pilot field in country scale to verify the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalisation and officials plan to expand the territory of the legal trade, but at the same time, they cautiously wait for instructions from the federal government still plan to consider selling and marijuana cultivation as federal crimes.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice department will give in on this issue.
Despite the arrests that have just received a broad resonance of dealers and their patients using marijuana on medical evidence, the federal government in most cases, allowed trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Fight agents of the office on drugs would break it into their homes to seize a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the shops of recreational marijuana governed by the state government which are covered under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on issues of the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado didn't wait for the actions of the federal government.
The presidential election some local authorities approved a moratorium on opening new stores on marijuana sale and so could not open until a year.
Last week, Montrose, the city in the western part of staff, nominated a six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week for consideration.
"We don't want to be in a position that we will give someone a license and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level", Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council said.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now the contradiction is available here between the results of local vote and objects, for which the state voted.
There are many other outstanding issues.
Petronella Uayett: me survivors from the Oxford that I am a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views did not start today.
How many I remember myself, I've always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and brother studied at Oxford and described it as an educational institution best in the world, the modern equivalent of an antique symposium subtab two foundations of civilization, free-thinking and tolerance.
Still, two weeks of study later in the Department of history of Worcester College, Oxford university in the late 1980s, I collected suitcases and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and began to cry.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper argued that I threw college because it was not pleased that my fellow-members have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Normann Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from stab cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, fled because they systematically poisoned and intimidation.
At all because of my rather unusual name or that I was in private school.
Me poisoned for one reason only, and in this glorified cradle of culture it looked a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Uayett, was the famous advisor Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of conservatives.
You ask why to remember it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students adhering to center-right views, at the same persecution.
This re-institutionalized and rising hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of the rights that is provided to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The Conservatives in the student club of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge announce that they "often actively isolate, subject to personal attacks and makes you feel like unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to join the committee on equal rights of the College of the additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was exacerbated by a documentary that has left recently on BBC 2 about politics in the student groups "A wonderland: young, smart and right "in that conservatives presented clowns and neo-Nazis.
Jo Cook, former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University who walk in Rolls-Royce was shown in the film, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.
At other universities conservative students complain that they do "scapegoats for raising tuition fees".
Luc black, 20 years, vice president of the Association of conservatives of Nottingham university, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said "in the university too great a focus on left increases.
People who don't even know us, believe us in advance audacious and with impunity violent children of rich parents ".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history of Corpus Christi College, whom the application for better protection was submitted, calling such an atmosphere "uncomfortable" and Stephanie Cheryl, 19, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, said that the attitude of the members of the student club carriers of center-right views dramatically worsened.
"It is a threat to both the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, and it is easy to normal life of club members", she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not simply to minorities, I was one.
I arrived in September 1986, a timid and shy 18 year old girl.
Oxford was in the fever with hatred of conservative party.
The year before the university vote stripped the former student, Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of reduced budgets for the higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week of a first-year student when students meet each other and teachers, I felt for the first time that was waiting for me ahead.
I didn't know what teachers not only made light of harassment of conservative students, but was also enjoying taking part in it.
Political affairs - a strike by miners, privatization and the opposition of the government to impose sanctions against the apartheid government, got into South Africa through the walls of audiences sheathe by wooden panels.
In my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not ready for that followed.
"Miss Uayett, the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, 'Please said, translate the first paragraph".
The text was offering me difficulty, I faltered.
Harry Pitt was very choleric man with a man like a pie.
"Thatcherites fundamentally do not learn French or simply brains are not sufficient to them? "he said.
Other students began to giggle.
I had tears in her eyes spoke.
"I advise you to take some initial lessons of the French in their free time, if you are, of course, not very busy, mixing in society", Pitt complained.
I returned to the room of the very unhappy.
That evening in college I sat at dinner one; then someone patted me shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student of the department of English, which was presented as a member of the Association of conservatives of the university.
"I know who you are, he said friendly.
  Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
With each suspected of supporting the Conservatives would be harassed.
It is hard for me, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so you will be more difficult.
The majority of conservative freshmen pretend that they are Labour ".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to play the hypocrite.
I insisted that agrees with everything he says to Margaret Thatcher.
Cunning failed.
A first-year student of the Faculty of philosophy, Politics and Economics who himself studied in Eton, said: "You're the daughter of the fascist pig.
You contagious ".
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
"How conservatives have sex? asked one of them.
  They bang each other, right? "
I felt like, should be, gay before the repeal of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt.
If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or I have yet to meet supporters only under the cover of darkness?
If I will be forced to become a labourite, and to hide the real faith?
Three years coming me began to seem hell full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, a conservative views, Norman Stone, a professor of modern history was not hiding.
He hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also that he was adviser Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speech writers.
In college he did not appear.
He despised it for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he has taken a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy", he said.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, sought refuge with relatives and impartial capital friends.
I told the father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
She didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s any political minds, there were adopted.
"But after all the same the best university in the world, he said plaintively.
  There of them are unable, not in the city of dozing spires...
Even my communist friends always behaved perfectly-the ".
His moist eyes grew turbid.
"Don't take any hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just jokes.
You will break my heart, if you cast university ".
I was exhausted by permalinks to travel to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a Conservative, did not withstand the pressure and refused the faith.
Next week at the seminar, when the next history teacher completely serious called me "an enemy of the people" I decided to do the same.
In the soul being burnt with shame, I recognized that "I was brainwashed over the coals by parents" and called them "the old fools".
The respite was brief.
My father was destined to hammer the final nail into the cover of the coffin of my career in Oxford.
At that time he wrote every week on two columns for the publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I didn't return.
Can call me a crybaby and rags.
But in eighteen years no one should be subject to such anger and intimidation in college.
That is more sad that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen prime ministers of the Tory, but also to this day is behind an unfair reputation of university, where value equality and free-thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegancy to glory"
About the event "Valentino: the master of sewing "which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Nati Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa and other famous clients of the Italian designer

This exhibition is the final part of the story that only character - "or Signore" Garavani, but it could not be written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition that opened on March 3, personal letters and photographs signed by the most tangible aristocrats, from the princess Salima Aga-Hang to Lord Snowdon, including Mari-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain abound.

In the public on models names like Sibylla Luexemburgskaja, Gloria von Turn und Taksis, Mette-Marit of Norway, with Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine.
Nati Abaskal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these customers said the first Valentino - as the first love, "it is impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was the pants, shirt, "vest" and a jacket from the collection fall-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that it gave me" - Nati Abaskal, one of the muses of the designer says.
"I prefer it to others for his femininity, for his great love for women because he underlines our beauty", former duchess de Feria adds.
I really like the colours he uses: There is a lot of light and they "approach" to his face.
The proportions are ideal.
The princess and remained trendsetter Patricia della Giovampaola D "Arenberg too cannot forget the first time dress in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will have age and an excuse to put on one of his evening wear...
Finally, what hour in the late 1990s came.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Eduarda de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, "corsage" about the fold and cut strapless.
"It was a dream has become a reality", Rodrigo's widow D "Arenberg says.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless", the Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires explains.

He sat at a table with the countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"It was perfect, age does not exist for it".
If it is said by the princess...
The heaviest profession in the world: miners from Kavakh-Idzhen
For four euros Indonesian miners risking life and limb, dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur on volcano top on steep stony tracks
There are people for whom their work - hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them Anto Vidzhaya, one of 400 miners who make a living from sulphur production in the volcano Kavakh-Idzhen located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descend into the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the depths of Earth, freezes at contact with air.
Having broken away vast stretches of sulphur total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets and carries them up on a steep rocky road.
To the volcano upper height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but are required to emaciated loaders more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail's pace, barely keeping balance and carefully groping the road to stumbleth and fall over the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them life as it happened to one tourist from France, which broke a few years ago from Kavakh-Idzhen's rocks.
Miners from Kavakh-Idzhen earn 5 euro for every kilogram of sulphur that extract
Appearing above, they make their way through between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, three kilometres to scale the mining company set up a bit above, at the height of 1.850 metres out.
It is a matter of PT Kandy of Ngrimbi, the company that manages since 1960 the volcano and better and not to say, workers to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro) to petrochemical industries, after all this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamit and even for sugar bleaching.
"As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) for each trip", explains us Anto who usually carries out three daily carryings.
It spends three hours for each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it appears next to nothing amount for such inhuman effort, it is three times what it would earn in the field.
"The day's pay to miners is very high by local standards where 15,000 rupees (1.2-propane euros) pay for the coffee a day and the average monthly earnings is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)" - the classloader who worked as a quarrier at the tourist island of Bali earlier explains.
Her salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the site was not as dire, but Anto came back with his family to Banyyuvangi, small town near the volcano, on a good reason that in Indonesia is the same overwhelming as sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus and brought her to Java that it had converted to Islam".
Anto has asthma, he labors to breathe, constantly continual cough, and at his eyes because of toxic gases water
At 27, Anto spent three years, risking itself in Kavakh-Idzhena that sulphur has already started to affect it despite a mask and special glasses.
It has asthma, he labors to breathe, constantly continual cough, and at her eyes, because of toxic gases emitted by the volcano water.
This is the price he must pay to achieve the dream.
"Two more years because I want to open shop will work or to learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punishable by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, the waiter or porter in hotel, but instead she is doing the work of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulphur did not stop following at night, when its distinctive yellow lines in blue and shines amid the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, shining itself the way, with the flashlight connected to his helmet he purchased on the money.
About 400 porters drag baskets sulfur on the shoulders of a volcano bottom
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not designing sulphur production for cost savings and does not provide any equipment to porters who work at the expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they did not even receive a part of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for shooting, which, along with the admission ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2-propane euros), guards of the reserve increase from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people mules.
"This work for cattle, not for people" - Badrusin, a stocky porter 42 who spent three decades, since college in Kavakh-Idzhena says.
The ability to bring to 110 kilograms, he insists he will suffer work "so much, how many will be able" because the money to education for their three children aged between 18 and 10 years should.
I will not resign, I will die here, because the volcano are my whole life
Although sulphur burns the throat and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so strong that no doesn't complain of a serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, arthrosis, knee pain and shoulder ulcers that were deformed under the weight of baskets.
Balancing with a basket on the back, Unaynik can lift now 50 kilograms at 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano three trucks transport on a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming distance at 18 miles on the narrow path among the bushes.
"I will not resign, I will die here, because the volcano are my whole life" - Unaynik declares, opening his mouth wide where there is no more teeth.
From his five children, a senior, 30 years, also works with sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation, one of the hardest classes in the world: in what human mules from Kavakh-Idzhen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education of a lack of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
I am a husband Patriot, you are my wife a patriot, we will fulfill our duty, and we will create a life!
It may seem unlikely that these lines are part of advertising mint bread, but in spite of this, or perhaps thanks to this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local sayings it seems "Let's put Bao (roll) in the oven" to laugh, fertility rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes hope that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an engaging way.
The creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use music force that people met "the national duty".
It only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world on reproduction similar, so we felt that is the subject that we should mention.
We knew that the government has tried to make a lot of things, for example to carry out the launch of beaches or to organize parties of rapid dating (blits appointments).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but optional worked.
So we thought why us not to make the most creative thing from can tackle this problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 children
Who do not take it lightly, so the Government of Singapore.
It spends 1.300 US dollars a year for policies to the enthusiasm of citizens on the birth of more children.
The state package for married couples and parents gives 15,000 dollars for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But it has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech party city in southeast Asia, also known for conservatism of the management and strict public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national authority on population is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, it was less than 2 - what is known as a substitute percent in 1976.
So why Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Vey of Min, director of the Office of policy of married couples and families of the National Directorate of the population, said that the reason for that "improved education" and "a wider range of careers".
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options with regard to the life goals and priorities, and weddings and family life", she explains.
These changes of social norms promote growth in the number of bachelors and postponing marriage and the birth of children, so the birthrate in Singapore declined.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront a declining population, causes outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants flourish, particularly Chinese who criticize to keep wages low and unwillingness to be integrated.
Immigration growth is seen as one of the reasons for that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the elections there was an attempt to solve the problem, by means of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling fertility has known impact on economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenses and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also are beginning to some unexpected consequences.
The government has a role that so many small housing was not built.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
A guide to urban development passed to control the number of small apartments known as "a shoe box" that can be built in some areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a single way of life and remove incentives for developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Put, the director general of house-building company EL Developers, said that they "shoe boxes" sold much faster than more spacious copies.
They are more popular in the sense that the apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than apartments in the larger size.
As a result, our revenue increase.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules give clearer guidance for developers who put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project before.
Too over-extended
Singapore is the city-state.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in financial quarter of the centre, it seems that they will not have special effect.
"People are very over-extended, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this many people postponing it", the young manager said.
Other people can have children.
"But it is important for me to have their own time and money", another young man of 20 years said.
Men and women mention his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them to have children.

How it uses the definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Whether he understands the dangers to which is displayed during the discussion on the Internet in situations that would not share out of the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases they associated the term with "something very much mine" in the private jet, and "your password and username" when applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't load my greatest mysteries in the post" - ten-year-old Jorge when it seeks to clarify personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts two years said.
"It is very sensitive secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world", he said.
On FB I download beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games.
I also have a good time with friends.
"I would not share a photo that not mine, or someone acts stupid", he said.

"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example", said.
According to the boy, no one ingratiate with him and did not ask his home address or phone number.
"If I go, or demand, I'll just remove them from the account", he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after recommendation reading in Twitter.
Experience is not alien to the boy that it is now known as cyber-mobbing.

Key issues
Maryelos Porras, an English teacher and an expert on education and training, believes that to send children and adolescents, it is important to understand that the purpose of social networks, to inform.
"The Internet appeared as a means to information, but with the arrival of these sites rules of the game" changed, she said.
Porras indicates that the academic Mark Prenski, master of education at Yale and author of the work Digital natives and immigrants, invented these dates to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives they, children and young people who were born in an era of technology.
"We are digital immigrants should teach them while we continue to study", she says.
Explains that the topic is complex, "because we are asking to have some measure of what is possible or it is impossible to distribute, publish or say, the elderly, when the maturity lacks for this purpose".
"That they are selective, while the most important thing is to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about consequences", she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and adolescents, ask questions that force them to reflect.
"To tell them that they did not do this, it is useless", she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things that you wouldn't say the stranger, so why you do it on the Internet?
Or, it would be nice to you if posted the photo you like, what do you published with a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign photos from parties if you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
And another whether all need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online just as do offline.
The rules.
"Out of the Internet people behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles as should be on social networks", she said.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardiya, a university teacher, professor of primary school and a consultant on education, explains the need for heads of household politicians of social networking honestly read.
Understanding each of the points, they have a good reason to talk with children about presuppositions.14 opening an account online.
"For example, age and that it is allowed to distribute or publish", he said.
According to Gaurdiya, a key issue is to remind children the lesson "don't talk to strangers".
The summit of the Union of South American Nations ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
Vi presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the Lima declaration, which had previously and has been theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document was signed at the VI next Summit of the Union of South American Nations, however, sources from the office and the presidential administration indicated on the home page that he will transfer following the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it will be posted on the site of the Peruvian government.
On the text, they said the contents were made by Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement.
Access for journalists to information about the event was limited all the time.
During the day it was only broadcast in the hall for the press, video of the presidential assembly without sound with the message "the private meeting, the sound it is illegal".
The few information circulated among reporters, was transferred to press secretaries of some governments of the Union of South American nations that attended the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The list of state presidents, prompting hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, who asked more data was the only document circulated during the day.
Subsequently, the Administration of Peru's president sent the electronic communication of media reports "the final declaration" summit, but it is a matter of Humala's statement, rather than the official document that the summit ended.
Last October Peru accepted the III Summit of the South American and Arab countries (ASPA) and that time, despite the fact that he was required hard by the press, the so-called Lima declaration, which previously announced, too, was not widespread.
On the ASPA official site, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings the Peruvian authorities have tried that transfer systems for all journalists were provided, but as much as possible limited information.
The summit also ended with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court to resolve territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts on Monday in the Hague hearing statements on both sides, in charge Lima brought against Santiago.
"We will respect and follow a solution that would explain the differences that we currently available to the International Court of Justice", Humala, near the Chilean colleague said.
"Chile has been and there will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and the international tribunals", Piñera added, and greeted handshake of Umalu against flags of the two countries.
Confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice, was long before Colombia protested the Bogotsky pact under which it recognized a submission to the verdicts of the International Court of Justice following the decision to sea border with Nicaragua, which it felt wrong this week.
The summit took place in the absence of presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which membership in the Union of South American Nations had been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of his former president Fernando Lugo, did not take part in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and for the summit closing, shortly after noon on Lima time.
The head of state reading the final document that reported that 16 agreements adopted and action directions according to 31 projects among South American countries have been approved, the amount of estimated investment made $17 billion.
Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that the countries of the Union of South American Nations will take "important steps to the purpose of the South American citizenship for which we expand agreements on a residence".
He said that action to improve "cooperation in combating the uncertainty of citizens and against transnational organized crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, inexpensive Internet access in all parts of South America and noted by cumulative and effective way of the risks of natural disasters" are taken.
As Europe in crisis "economic association (Latin America) shouldn't have a triumfatorsky basis, and should serve to expand our manufacturing basis and expect a better future for our cities" Humala said.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 sign projects to improve communication of spaces of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and form new economic schemes "- the Peruvian president in the read the message said.
Among the projects he mentioned that five treat Peru, and are limited to cross axes in its territory from coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at big relationship with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
Also the outcome document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process will serve in the country to its repeated joining the Union of South American nations" from which it is now excluded.
The need for that Latin America remained the well-being and world region would be integrated, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another subject stressed at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos said before participating in a regional meeting that hopes to meet a colleague from Nicaragua, Ortega on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate a valid form of maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice challenged by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (on Saturday) maybe I will meet President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"Let's review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua would require discussion with Nicaragua", he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I will be able to say that we will deal with this maximally-possible civilized and respectful image", Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City where they provided presence on the introduction to the position of the new president of the country, Enrique Peña Ñeto.
As part of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met in advance for approval of a plan of action for 2013, which is aimed at dialogue and consensus building on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form Unasur while the involvement of the last of the countries is suspended.
Peru has temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of common citizenship is the purpose for which "South America, in this case and must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told state television of Peru that Europeans "were killing each other during World War II" in other conflicts, "but they now almost a homeland".
He defended, in this context, a project of the establishment of the South American citizenship, approved by members of the Union of South American Nations.
"We need to make the free movement of citizens and workers over a South American country as it is now happening with members of the Andean community, but there are reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian president proved, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the impact of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account of those who signed a Pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who give lectures, never undertake any obligation, and we South Americans, on the contrary, we sign everything.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum made by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder to Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret this decision because he did not betray the principles, and observed the "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He added that in due time "there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and process" will not be upheld.
It criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come to its territory for questioning about the alleged crime of sexual violence, while "Swedish law finds it difficult to implement it via video conference, which could be made of the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he came to our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonic problem, nothing serious" - the Ecuadorian president said.
What really is, so it is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of the prison in tiny spaces without being able to do exercises on air.
"It affects the health of any person", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the shelter granted Assange since June in Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts and stressed that there were talks in London about finding a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, we in this case do not use the word, but there were ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is found in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garson, leads a number of processes in various European authorities", he said.
Also suggested that "if Britain will provide tomorrow a security guarantee, it will end".
And if Sweden as permitted heavily_endowed by its law and as it has done in other cases, interviewing Senor Assange in embassy of Ecuador in London or to question him on Skype, tomorrow the problem would be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not suffer "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort the freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of press freedom is not spolit villains politicians, and a bad journalists calling for a profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
At this point he was happy to have these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries hegemons do not dominate Ecuador" and added that, being re-elected "will deepen the revolution to development continued in the right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to retain the veto of Paraguay in the Union of South American Nations to at least the next election, arguing that the organization "must be strong and not suffer opportunism and support of revolutions in the guise of legitimacy" because in reality "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president regarded "perfect sense" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which appeared in favor of the Nicaraguan sea sovereignty.
However, this decision is not respected.
It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and to continue moving forward.
He also expressed the hope of good end of the dispute on the maritime boundaries that lead in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed that "it is right to appeal for Latin America in international courts if the two countries agree to make a decision, no matter how hard it was".
The opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that believes this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult".
Correa assured that if they lose elections in February 2013, will leave public life.
Personally I was never interested in power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be adjusted only from the political power.
"My political movement seen exactly what I guaranteed this likely victory so it must accept that responsibility", he said.
If elected, it would be my deadline as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, the same.
"The decision", he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which had already been planned, routine and that is expected to pass campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the worsening of the health of the President Chavez", he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian government participated today in Lima in the VI summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrice was 21 years old when she was told that his analysis on AIDS yielded positive results.
"Me as if stunned", he recalls that difficult, despite all the step of a doctor, the moment.
The young man hid it from the family.
Having decided to cope with the disease themselves, he wanted to know about it as much as possible. And his effort was true - he had celebrated the 43rd birthday.
Fabrice is one of the "oldest" patients of HIV office of the hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) hospital where he was in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He lives with his diagnosis "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) 22 years. In the early 1990s he would be difficult to believe it is too little then existed treatment options, too few people knew about disease, also was biased against patients.
So even the director of the clinic for the Mexican Institute for Social protection didn't want to say goodbye to it, "because it had a cut".
In other words, in those days have AIDS was a sentence.
Now you can survive at this syndrome and to do so, without damaging the quality of life.
However, without knowing about the illness, many more people come when the virus has already caused damage "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in the right time, and the survival of the general population exactly the same", the head of HIV office of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva said, referring to that this was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent of the defeat of the immune system available to patients at the beginning of diagnosis, with the best life expectancy at those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with CD4 number 200, and to 50 years, when it was reported about 500 CD4.
In other words, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years", he explained.
To assess this progress, it is important to remember that life expectancy of Mexicans averages today 76 years.
Although mortality fell dramatically in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report from UNAIDS) that since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in a national database died is also true.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 death by May this year are already registered; However, it is claimed that there is a universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
  Why there are still lethal endings?
  What I think the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine it, things in our hospital so.
At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients are very late because they don't know about contaminated state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
It provided massive data: "Nine out of ten patients come when already have any opportunistic infection- You need to do to make a bigger impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and should therefore be tests to detect on a massive scale, for all people who will ask him ".
In offering experts and officials of the State Council in AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) and patients, like Fabrice who turned to check in the private laboratory, prompted only that it was made by his friend and, despite an early age agree it was at the stage of AIDS and even had Kaposha's sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think will die, and want to know anything.
"Time, all the same I die, I will be better to be cut three times a week", they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I know eat, I do exercises, I take medicine.
Today, his parents know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life as any other.
"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with shared responsibility, I take care of myself and another person" - listed Fabrice who agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO JALISCO to move the statement of those now in the context of the World AIDS Day, is afraid.
Let there be tested if there was a risk of infection, let as soon as possible learn whether they are HIV positive, so better and if they already have a diagnosis, we learn that can live like any other persons responsible.
This is his message summarizes the fight theme against AIDS that 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The abysses between programs in health and a simple citizen are great, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has dealt with the problem with HIV said.
And the largest is prevention.
In places on this task, "in fact condom distribution have increased, before we were given one or two, now we are packages hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are still does not have access to condoms", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections there are teenagers.
"Why are they to you? "it is a popular issue, with malice and condemnation from social workers, school consultants, employees of pharmacies and health workers which young people don't want to hear, a campaigner assured.
I propose to modify the inefficient allocation; that condoms were not only for chips and that hundreds of them was in machine guns in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It is not licentiousness encouragement.
This is not about beer and motel payment, the governor Emilio Gonzalez asked answered whether condom distribution is possible at his office.
"It is not sexuality, is best to make condoms available to those who have practiced sexual activity", he said.
Key details in Jalisco
13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) registered.
The state ranks 4th in the national ranking in new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92% of the infections belong to a sexual way 6% through blood and 2% to the perinatal way.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV as one recorded case is from 4 to 5 people who don't know about it.
Given the ratification of the decision by the court of appeal of the United States, which cancels debt restructuring of the Vitro Group, achieved through competitive products in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for a national company with branches in the neighboring country to solvency problems.
It seems that procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law, were not effective in the country of bands and stars, in conflict with international agreements.
In practices, approval of a decision reached on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale in court of bankruptcies of the northern District of Texas, leaves unwarlike Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of the seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
But the resolution is opening the door to the leading producer of glass in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, bringing into evidence three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of business notes that creditors should be regulated by the Code of the US to bankruptcy, the court of appeal of the fifth district located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerns the competitive products considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph overturns international judicial cooperation in insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, the Model law of the UN on international trade law Union was created for the purpose, defined as an arbitrator the American institute of Law.
Second, the verdict establishes that without the intercompany vote, acknowledged in a critical mass of competitive products of debt that had Vitro branches before the parent company, would not be reached the majority needed for the adoption of restructuring.
However, this capability is acknowledged by the Mexican laws.
In fact, the laboratory was not the first time the scheme is adopted.
There are a half-dozen examples including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debt guaranteed Federal institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voices of industries, in any case the creditors of Vitro who had fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely stervyatniki funds like Aurelios capital Aurelios Convergencia, Elliott Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of Appeal lowers the data.
On the other hand, he accuses the Laboratory of the difficult situation facing that came up since 2008, affected by severe economic crisis, which surpassed the United States military strikes on the country.
Meanwhile, the family firm Gonzalez Sada will show the decision appeal in court of appeal that the vote reached its plenum, that is, the five judges in view of the fact that three voted.
In the event of failure of a petition for a certificate which will require a process review from a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court will be shown.
Worse still, the court rejected a document sent by the government of Mexico as affiliate amicus curiae ("a friend of court") in that process, to which Vitro within the Law on competitive production follows described, signaling that it frees itself (himself) by their enforcement of the agreements signed by both countries to connect it with article 15 of the Law of the US to bankruptcy.
It is also noted that the country responded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, that is, to the rules for cases of cross-border insolvency that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Canon from two boards: they hit in Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
Given the complaints delayed for several months on the table by labor unions of Mexicana de Aviación against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, a trade union pilots association pilots have already found the bottle neck.
The court led by Carlos Diaz Chavez of Morino, just introduced a requirement of the criminal case against the National Commission on Banking and securities, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisor systematically refused to provide reports in the general prosecutor's office of the republic of the operation performed by the businessman to extract the secret fund F/589 of IXE bank of 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to buy shares of Professional management company of hotels.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of a network of Posadas hotels.
Surround Dragon Mart
Having met on weekends at a forum in the Caribbean university, a group of local and foreign NGOs, academics, businessmen and members of the common civil society approved the creation of a broad front for the opposition to the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We say as you know, the great centre of sale and distribution to Mexico, Central America and Caribbean countries of the production of the isolated country, with a residential area next to the staff of 150 companies.
Before Canacintra managed to unite the rulers of the south-eastern area for the opposition to a monumental forces that leveled parts of protected areas and raised serious threats against the industry.
The death of ACTA
Against the requirement of the senate rejected by the government to explain, under what conditions and circumstances, the ambassador of Mexico in Japan signed a Trade agreement to combat counterfeiting, known as an acronym in English ACTA, according to the Mexican institute of industrial property, the case has already passed into archive.
As you know, the event was executed in spite of the fact that the senate disqualified the opportunity to see it as violating freedom of expression on social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
A keen basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was due more than 60 years with the sport and, thanks to it, visited the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico store in memory so many basketball history, as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
After all, before the hemorrhage chained to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, the player of the Highest basketball league, the representative and head of BSN with Cowboys of Bayamon and president of the Federation of basketball.
"I spent many roles in basketball throughout his life, including a little at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the National team and the president of federation in the 1990s", Reyes alsoremembered during Primera Hora visit to his home to Bayamon where he lives with Isabel, a faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes does not exaggerate, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected for a long way, witness.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions it stores who remember his way through the Cowboys since the middle of the 1950s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his performance as a coagent or agent of the deal were executed.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed most of all because had the opportunity to be part of eight championships of Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, coagent or head.
There were many years of pleasure, including five championships, has gone from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, in a year of the debut of Jerome Minsi in BSN.
Since then, and from now on "Kuko" Ortiz, who was a great administrator "began to direct, Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartov who came here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me: "I you have a very strong player, growth 6 '7".
"You want?"
And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players who Puerto Rico had.
Boards then recommended sniper Raimonda Gauss, who granted citizenship and became one of our best goal-scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship to Bayamon, Gauss would help to win one more.
With Gauss I took pleasure in the championship of Cowboys, but already at a distance in that 1988 were the chief of the federation.
By then I preferred to have his achievements and achievements of Minsi as a national team.
I remember we won for the first time against the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the 1990 World Championships in which we received a fourth place came along and it had to be a bronze if not for the Canadian judge who made us to change the final game, said Reyes.
That team from the 1990 World Championships is the best team that you've ever seen?
He is among the best as well as that defeated Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that from the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the of the USA national team which was too similar to that which won us the bronze in the World Cup.
In the team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon system, FICO Lopez and 'Pikulin' (Ortiz) but also young (Javier) 'Tonyito' colona and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco, and Edgar) and Mario 'Quixote' Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s year because of a wound to the knee.
The team that was probably not the best in the state plan, but brought the gold medal and a great joy, there was a team of Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neukena, Argentina.
With role players like 'Kanito' Nyeves Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Jurruitner instead of players, suspended for the turmoil in the Pan American championship Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt that it was Pikulin Ortiz.
Its performance on the international tournaments impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico did not rule at this level as it was done by Pikulin.
And it without his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican head?
It is very difficult.
We had a very good young growth including by Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raimonda Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider the greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s, BSN was to 17 teams in the season.
What did you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to know, for example, regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now children travel and play too much, and it is excessive.
At least I see the fruits of mandatory certification and the course for managing directors, officers and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What you do now?
Most of all I listen to music, I watch music videos of my era at YouTube, I'm enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally I go to basketball.
And, of course, I enjoy society of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hegmen died
Larry Hegmen who was born on September 21, 1931, in Fort Worth (Texas) became world famous thanks to a leading role as John Ross of Ewing, who is better known as the "J.R". in the TV series "Dallas" in which it embodied an entrepreneur without the principles, angry and manipulating.
Larry Hegmen whose role oil magnate predator Jay Ar Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a greed symbol in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hegmen who returned this year, as J.R. in the new season "Dallas", died on Friday night because of complications of cancer, according to the announcement of the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros. company. The studio of production of "Dallas".

Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was near Hegmen when he died in hospital in Dallas, the representative Jeffrey Leyn said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, tender and talented, and I will miss very much.
"He was a true personality and led a full life", said Gray in a statement.
Cirrhosis was diagnosed with Hegmen in 1992 and he admitted that he drank for many years.
In 1995, he found a malignant tumor in the liver and he transferred transplant.
Long before "Dallas", Hegmen became popular on television due to the role of decent form in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie" broadcast by NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl genie who is played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with it under one roof.
He has also been the main character of two comedies which rarely appeared in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in film included the roles that have been well received by critics, in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But his masterful interpretation is delicious loathsome J.R. Hegmena on glory top brought.
The drama series of CBS about the clan Yuingov and other characters in his entourage went on air since April 1978 to May 1991.
Advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.? "designed for sensation creation around the episode full of emotions in which the character Hegmen almost do not kill, generated international discussions and millions of dollars that risked in bookmaker offices.
It also helped attract series record audiences during that time.
When the response in an episode of November 1980 was provided, on average 41 million viewers watched him and turned "Dallas" in the second for the number of views entertainment in history, after "MASH" final in 1983, attracted 50 million viewers.
It was J.R sister-in-law. Christine (performed by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. it prevented and then threatened that would accuse it of prostitution, should it not be moved away from the city, but others also had reason to attack.
Hegmen played Ewing as insatiable corrupt official with the charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and adulterous husband who wanted his wife an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) placed on treatment.
"I know that should be on J.R Tomb". - Hegmen in 1988, said.
It must be said: "Here's the honest citizen of J.R is based. Ewing ".
It is the only transaction that he lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also a heroine of original series, recalled on Friday Hegmen as someone "huge, both in and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of fans around the world, with the hearts of each of us fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of new release "Dallas" shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Record of five episodes of the second season was finished and the sixth was in production, told the channel.
Warner or TNT has not yet made the claim that will be with series after Hegmen's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, it was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during the marriage with a lawyer Ben Hegmen.
He tried his luck on theater stage of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force of England between 1952 and 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Akxielssong and married her.
A couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived a long time in the California city of Malibu, where live many celebrities.
In 2001 he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) of Tales about My Life ".
"I didn't include anything that would feel able to hurt anyone or affect somehow", he said Prensa Asociada at that time.
After a liver transplant he began to promote donation of organs and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help patients who feel fear.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go on operations, and after", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, it seems "fear not, it will be a little bit uncomfortable for a short time, but you will be okay".
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The process, which is investigating "Doomsday" begins
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic events such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester when the professor of religion Stewart Sharma has decided to make a course about the end of the world, he knew had an irresistible bait: the end of "a long countdown" Mayan calendar, on December 21 for which many people as seized on the evidence that the end of the world approaches.
But Sharma had no idea that it expected in coming months: The devastating hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddony" and the growing conflict which to draw Israel, a place where Christian theorists of the end of The times believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester from all", said Sharma this week to university students Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If you analyse what is happening in the world now, as if we have only 30 days, it was really good period.
And remember that bad it is good for those apocalyptic view.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on "doomsday" in this semester, theoretically, the last in history.
At Templsky university associate professor Barry Wacker gives the process "the media, Culture and Doomsday".
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spill over", he said, and the way in which offer a hypothetical scenarios of certain acts of man.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could erupt.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and studied how they related to the real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students that perhaps might plausibly and impossible", said Wacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, a professor of history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amarah Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, united to give the course "Doomsday" is called simply.
"We do not add '2012' to always be able to give the course again if the end of the world does not come" - Restall said.
Despite "inevitable destruction" students should learn, develop projects and pass the exams.
In Penn State final exam will be adopted on the eve of the Apocalypse that does not go to students of choice but to work "until that night in which it has estimated that there will come the end of the world", Restall said.
Courses were quite popular.
"Places ended in two hours" - Restall said about the process for students with a high GPA, in which 35 students registered.
We received an e-mail for weeks before the semester from people who asked if there are still places.
Students, in turn, say the course one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to console himself", Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the office of religion and sociology from Haddonfild said, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And apocalyptic mode of thought, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old student at the Department of psychology and nursing, said he was watching all the apocalyptic movies.
"I never heard of a course that would teach it", he said.
It's nice to me.
But none of the students interviewed - not to mention the professor, did not say that believes in doomsday date on December 21.
"Our first project mentioned a prophecy of Maya, and in some ways we discredited it", Julie Zeglen, says student last year at Templsky university from Uest-Chester said.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; It is a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concerns in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicted the end of the world.
The Internet caused increasing that speculation.
"Elsewhere, people don't think of it", he said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion at the University La-Sal who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows about any course about "doomsday" there.
"Philippines do not take part in the end of the world", he wrote, referring to the order of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Father.
Restall noticed that has long been said about the many days of the last court and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately start thinking of the next date" or to philosophize that on December 21 is the beginning of the seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely treat that date.
Some said they are going to go to "doomsday" parties.
"Maybe I will call one of your friends together to laugh", said Samir Ford, the 20-year-old student School of Communication.
