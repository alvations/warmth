What there is going to happen? CSSD not connait neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new elected representatives of CSSD in the city council of the capital will obviously have to overcome a real linguistic barrier to understand each other at the level of the town council with their ancient and new collegues of ODS.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the town council belonging in CSSD, to know if they know the argôt who was born in the course of dernieres years in the city council, when it was the partners of the current alliance that ran in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague put under way in the course of the previous epoch of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some some of the personalities, situations, and reasons of the metropolis.
It is with astonishment that he was discovered that the new elected representatives do not understand known terms trés well.
At least they say it.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I really do not know."
"I am a jeunôt in pragoise policy Lukas Kaucky, the elected representative in culture in the test of the vocabulary of the "sponsor" reacted.
And as for the political veteran, the elected representative Karel Brezina reacted similarly.
For example sense of "hole of golf."
"It is the only expression among those whom you offer me that I use"
Otherwise, I do not use the argôt.
Of the vocabulary, the daily Aktualne.cz of which published expressions in June of this year before the congrés meadow-éĺectoral of ODS, the writing chose 6 examples, first and foremost those who are linked with the city council of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the sense of "Voldemort," "the biggest hole of golf in Prague," go to the patisserie ," " nerve of beef ," " treason of the capital "and " entôler."
Three of the elected representatives agreed for the quiz, the quatrieme-Antonin Weinert, who must run education in Prague in future - promised a maintenance first of all but then did not take the telephone down.
The fifth elected representative Petr Dolinek bluntly refused the test.
"I take care in no way of these things there and how the representatives of citizen's democracy have a good time: I will not give my opinion."
"I take care currently of the way we are going to understand each other as part of our programmes," he reacted has t.
As he has been already heard, the elected representative Lukas Kaucky would not admit obviously in the legend above, that it is about influential Janousek on the businessmen and friends of the Romance ex-mayor Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing á' Kaucky and the only expression that he guessed in the test is "the biggest hole of golf in Prague."
"It is about the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it about newspapers."
"I am going to have to pay a course of language," joke t him.
Not only the bullfighter Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, the elected representative for environment, know that the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko.
Both Social Democrats know who is indeed Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the character - he thinks of sense "to go to the pastry."
"It is a question, I think, of going to a firm," Plachy is ready to guess that it is about the seat of the societies of Janousek.
On the same your Brezina reminds that he draws the knowledge rather of newspapers and of any vocabulary which he would use.
According to the candidates for tests there is no lexicon of argôt in social democracy.
"I asked for advice with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have anything of this type."
"They claim rather to be names some time abbreviations and symbols are used," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the socio-democratic Party, that the members of the Party call Hulda.
"I was called Briza to the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me as it, confesses Karel Brezina regarding nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and this walks.
The elected representative Weinert is Grandpa for the members of the Party or the least friendly old Baby, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before elections by frauds during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed " the small toy ."
Nicknames are as the only ones as the Social Democrats allow to use inside the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda very much, but the daily Akutel.cz recorded another nickname for this president pragois.
"Doctor of Law of nightstick" reminds it seems that Petr Hulinsky got his title of DOCTOR OF LAW JUDR.À the academy of police of bratislava.
The government wants to diminish torture of the "sorceresses," edited a booklet.
In the Burkina Faso, the women declared intricate have common features.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for example for reasons of health, are free and do not have child.
The one who becomes "intricate" is isolated not to threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destiny very seldom."
"The young women in good health are not either judged because they participate in job and deliver children," declares a sister who takes care in the capital of this country of Western Africa, the Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who were rejected by the society.
The local government decided to intervene against this "unusual social measure."
He edited a booklet which should help the witch-hunt has limit.
Affair includes a "hitch."
"More than 70 for one one hundred adults in the Burkina Faso cannot read," informed the daily Die Standard regarding the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of sorcery is common in other countries of Africa.
In Ghana, neighbour of the Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died having been tortured by three women and a man then burnt with some oil which they had sprayed it.
It is the server of BBC that transmitted this information.
The criminals maintain that it was about the bad eye.
According to their version oil which is of use for ritual unctions emflammée in the contact of the woman.
The oil burnt, he parried, when the team wanted "to dispel bad mind" of the woman.
The insulation of the "sorceresses" is approved by the persons of any levels of education.
The daily Der Standard named a 42-year-old businessman of the Burkina Faso: "The eaters of human minds always represented a danger," said he.
While the Burkina Faso tries hard to reduce the witch-hunt, Gambia not later that the last year even saw the President himself participating in it.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, threw a broad witch-hunt which, he parried, would have participated in its death and tried hard by black magic to kill the President also."
"Shamans of close Guinea come to rescue, brought to firm presidential election in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and of the personal nurse of the President, men and of the women chosen haphazardly dansdes villages of Gambia," pointed out in a message the organisation "Amnesty International.
To the farm the arrested persons had to drink a potion based on plants to hallucinogènes effects who caused besides other effects on kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive it.
On international pressure it is one thousand persons who were released.
The tenant of Bakal: Poèles heats up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing old man went out by the door of the centre customers of the society RPG BYTY of the "baron of the coal" Zdenek Bakal, the biggest owner deprived of flats to be rented in Czech Republic.
He carried a file under the arm with three new hire contracts for three flats: his, that of its daughter and of its son who is spirit to purge a trouble.
Deregulation made augment the rent to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to regulate 4100 crowns from next year for a flat 2+1 of second category.
"And there is not hot water and the heating works in the solid fuel," the man points on the new contract of his son with the power of signature.
"But I signed nevertheless" explain t him in motié angered and half relinquished.
The citizen's association of flats BytyOKD.cz which described nouelles conditions of renting as "indecent and indecent," recommends to the tenants not to sign and wait until December 7th, date in which will be published a note to explain method to be followed to complain.
But the man reacts to it by a wave.
"Says it, other one says something else" by frowning eyebrows.
The region of Ostrava becomes the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, it is what waits most flat in for Czech Republic rents of which do not correspond at the price of the market.
Aktualne.cz decided for this reason to visit personally the "laboratory."
The waiting room of RPG on the street Havirovska is one of four of the region of Ostrava and it is already full on Tuesdays at 09 am.
Just next to the door is held a guard of a society of security with an apparatus to call the clients.
A special button, "rent 2011," is lighted on the touch screen.
The single pressure and a paper with a number goes out of the apparatus.
You have no time to read your number "157 " which your number begins to light up already on big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a split second it is your turn.
After short instant, an old couple arrives to enquire about the rent, but the new rents do not seem to concern people in the waiting room.
The majority of people came to regulate common problems as everywhere - request of repairs, events concerning insurance and others.
In the region of Ostrava, people of more than 44000 flats of the portfolio of RPG RECOIVENT mails with the new contracts of lease in their post box since about mid-November.
RPG BYTY offers them increase of rent from 15 to 38 for one hundred.
the special counter for the new rents is opened to the public since November 18th.
"it works for week, it is therefore still on probation" the employee behind the counter answers, after an instant of hesitancy, when the client comes as journalist.
The déragulation and miners' ancient flats of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the Parliament and native of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats mentioned it of a way supported enough before elections and it fills from now on the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They even did not change me one could n of board in toilet, relieves in introduction the mentioned man.
However, it is especially, according to the employees, the pensioners that come to be sure that they will accept a discount on the new price of the rent if they sign now as promised it RPG in a special bargain.
It is a discount of the half of the sum of the rent which will accept other loctaires who will have signed their new contract before December 15th.
But the counter "deregulation" of the street Havirovaska is not really scourged by questions.
"Among 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 - 50 came for the rent," points out the employee in the counter.
And however RPG PORPOSE both on its site web and in the windows of annual appraisals on rents when he is necessary.
If both parts do not agree on the rent it is an independent court which will make decision.
'It is not about threats but only to inform on way unique and legitimate to act legally," points out RPG on the site web.
"Here nobody will go to the court" one of the employees of RPG Byty thinks and the man on the street owing the centre of customers gives him reason.
"I have 13000 crowns of retirement and I have 5000 crowns to eat, I do not have enough to go to the court," said he.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We will see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in media ask that nobody signs the persons and therefore wait," point out t her.
The regulation of rents ends in Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increase, according to RPG BYTY, is an economic necessity.
"And, besides, the current rents still do not attain necessary level for the simple maintenance of the fund for accommodation," reminds Pavel Klimes, manager of the residential portfolio of the society RPG BYTY, that it is just the negligence of the fund for the accommodation that returns the angered tenant the main reason of the increase of the rent is.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG it could with rents invest in flats 4 thousand millions, in four years of 2011 has 2014 should be 5.2 thousand millions.
The big screen hung on the ceiling in front of chairs padded by the waiting room of the street Havirosvka, repeats however some information pointed out in red.
'The increase of the rent in 2011 is 15 for one hundred and concerns not less than 31200 flats that is more than 90 for one one hundred flats of RPG."
"And it will always be in most 7.50 Czech crowns m ² a month," points out the screen.
The increase of 38 for one hundred concerns only 400 flats of the portfolio of RPG.
"In these cases there, it is about an increase of a sum really very low 19.66 Czech crowns in m ²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 flats.
RPG BYTY promises that deregulation will not cause a radical but progressive increase over 4 - 8 years.
She adds other commitments: all money of the increase of rents (cf. graph) is made in flats in the form of savings of heating - to be new windows and to be heating.
Those who sign agreement on the increase of rent take precedence.
The nursery school is part, also, offices understood the architects.
the administrative building Avriopoint of Brno is the new seat of the society Arch. Design.
Nobody would have been able to expect that it also shelters a tiny nursery school with all what is needed - walls of colours, inventive pieces of furniture, toys and finally miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October of last year, are possible become the children of the employees of Arch design there.
The society of plans-architectonics Arch. Design. workshops of which produced a big number of buildings in Brno, imagined its tiny nursery school of firm since the first draughts of the building Avriopoint.
She uses about 90 persons, especially of age to make children and it was important to her that the women architects and leaders of plans could fast come back to job.
At the same time as contracts of employment on time weak, the nursery school is a no-claims bonus offered to his employees by the society Arch. Design. as part of his social programme.
The constructors and the architects have so the possibility of alloying a job taking with care for the children.
They are the employees of Arch. Design.eux-mêmes who imagined this nursery school and with the help of direction they could get an allocation of the European Union and of the Ministry of Employment and of social affairs.
The tiny nursery school is financed by the means of the European social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and of the state Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the allocations of financing (at the level of 2.8 mil.de Czech crowns). They could buy equipment and apparatus and after two years assure a skilled personnel as well as the bet under way.
After the use of the allocation of financing (two years) the Arch society. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make work the tiny nursery school on its equity capital.
The preparation of plan lasted one year and it is the Economy rating society which helped to apply for allocation.
The care to the children is assured by a skilled personnel, all day long a nurse and a teacher of nursery school take care of children. the children can go to the nursery school without limitation of age but they have three more than anspour most.
As there is about a "tiny nursery school" him can be only 5 present children at the same time, but in the course of the day he are more who replace.
The functioning of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have even the right to use this school without look on hierarchic position.
Although he if agise an individual care and an education, the programme of the tiny nursery school is comparable to that for preschool education.
The children do not make there that to play but a quality education is also assured it - of the beginning up to preparation in the benches of school English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys and inventive games but also a computer which the children can use.
The presence of the small children in the society creates a friendly and positive environment.
The parents can at any instant control their child and have no stress of a delay to go to search the children in a school distant from the workplace of the parents.
The parents use therefore their working time in a most productive way.
It is not amazing that creates a natural relation of fidelity between the employee and the employer.
Arch. Design.s' is so registered among the societies which give a no-claims bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and that are friendly towards the family and through this programme reinforce the marketing of RH.
The home in bone fascinates even after 100 years. Throw an eye into the inside of Gaudi.
The toît resembles the back of a prehistoric saurien, the staircase in a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies in opened faces of fish.
That's how the home Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi is.
Because of its organic forms, the home accepted on behalf of places the nickname of Home in bone.
Organic forms, wild colours, unusual stony use, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, facade reminding of scales and everywhere presents of curves, here is all that am ypique for the Art nouveau of Antoni Gaudi.
The frontal facade of the home unwinds its lines of dream, its colours and nice textures which remind of nature and of animals.
In the course of more detailed observation geometry, rhythm and order thought accurately are seen.
At night the front of house becomes even more dramatic and is lighted so that the impression of brilliance of colours is reinforced.
Winding and torsion of forms also appears in inside with the same measure.
The wood copies in waves the frames of windows, the balustrades, the decorative elements of doors, the oeilleton and the small strips.
The home Battlo which stands in the district Eixample on the commercial street Passeig de Gracia in the number. 43, am born in the building of a home of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction made during two years and the home ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich businessman, first stressed the demolition of the vieile building and the building of one other very new but accepted fast the idea of Gaudi of an unusual reconstruction and of cheaply.
But one did not think by only Gaudi of the idea of Casa Battlo as home with numerous accommodation.
The architect Josep marry Jujol worked with him.
It is just on his plan that were born decorations for a flat of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade.
For the facade also worked of other artists and creators.
The common job for house plans Casa Battlo started with a cooperation in succés between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the building of the home of Gaudi Casa Mila and of the park Guell in which there are other writings of Gaudi.
Places nicknamed the home with heat just after its finishing because of its organic forms "the Home in bone."
Others, take into account the specific mechanism of opening of windows called it "the home which baille."
They say that in the top of the building there is a similar sword to that of Holy Georges the boss of the Catalonia.
Other elements of sculpture of the building contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi thought for the home of an unique system at the time of central heating, with vents of ventilation and of the typical chimneys.
Their 45 degree incline seems strange.
In the course of creation Gaudi absolutely did not respect directives of building at the time and is not allowed to hinder by them.
At the beginning of the building he got the licence on behalf of the city to construct, knowing, of course that data carried on the plans of reconstruction were so vague as two years afterwards during finishing the town council was horrified and asked for modifications.
He did not please, for example, the members of the town council whom the pillars of the building empiettent on the public pavement.
There has never been modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call from the city Josep Battlo asked (and got satisfaction) the permission to rent two higher floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and in the third a room and a part deprived of the flat.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery.
The whole six-storeyed home is shared by a staircase by which they achieve up to a terrace of independent toît.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the background of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked the modern concept of link of areas.
The common part can be completely linked up by opening the doors of living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or limit itself the space deprived for more intimate discussions.
The home with the reconstruction of Gaudi accepted besides new facades a not traditional toîture and two floors in more.
The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, of blue and white glass tiles with whom is decorated the courtyard and with the wells of light.
The game in two colours gives a maximum of light in all floors of the home.
It was simply enough to bet on principle that the white reflête more than the absolute who on the contrary absorbs sun's rays.
The home Casa Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the Fund of the worldwide Heritage of the UNESCO perhaps visited by each.
On the first floor of the home the most ample and the most splendid flat accessible to the public is.
The owners decided to cross this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued visits because they noted that it is about a profitable firm and they enlarged the field of visits in the common areas and in the loft including the terraces of toît.
The entrance ticket in the monument is really inexpensive and costs 16.50 euro; the students, the pensioners, groups and the possessors of tourist cards have 20 as hundred discounts.
Sum is nevertheless above the entrance fee in other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to smell the real atmosphere of the home with its fantastic turrets, you must fast find a friend among the inhabitants of the building and visit the home completely.
How to choose a mattress and a base: the women have other criteria than the men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the surface reserved for the bedtime, therefore the mattress and the base create a real base for a good bed.
They have to complement each other of course harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive:le weight, size, age, state of health as well as sex of the owner.
The type of inside in which the mattress is going to be put and the base is also important.
A typical example?
For example in the villa where they do not sleep persistently mattresses in latex are not appropriate because they "warm themselves up " slowly.
They have, moreover, the upper weight in mattresses in polyurethane standards.
It is necessary to turn them often.
If they do not have also enough channels of aeration in the heart and if they reside, on top of that, on a solid board, they keep humidity. Some mildew can also form there.
Habit is also decisive in the choice.
The one who crosses the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses with a rammollissante layer are often used, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all hokeyistes who returns from NHL complains that they cannot sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and coasts, they needed mattress with a rammollisante layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for the persons who suffer from diabetes with a confusion of the nervous system which therefore take badly information " of pronunciations and of skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specialises in the padded pieces of furniture.
It is for it that some years ago the mattress with the lazy foam won hokeyistes as well as other clients.
"Today everything walks well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have appropriate mattresses for example.
You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
She optimises her rigidity and her form according to absorbed heat or fits to the heat of your body.
Nothing lobbies on you and you will not turn round at night as after a difficult match.
You sleep simply better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against esquarres.
For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of feet, that is about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimal breadth for each for a bed in two places should be 90 cm is in very 180 cm.
For beds on the single place, singles for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm.
La commode de C'est demi-cadratin cas de visite.
'However it is a simple rule for the breadth of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should put down hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, Présidente de l' Association of the Saddlers-mattress makers and interior decorators who dedicates himself for several years to the problems of a healthy sleep and to the ergonomics of the furniture and the sign in the specialised schools.
For a bed in two places each needs its own base and mattress, therefore attention however during the achât to choose well the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will have only to take the base up to different height and it is not accomplishable on all frames of bed.
Mattresses bubble should have a minimal height of 14 cm, mattresses with springs at least 15 cm, of it count three centimetres for the layer of form and of ventilation at least.
"In touch or in position sat on the mattress you should not smell springs," Héléna Prokopova tells.
Every mattress asks for a type determined well by base.
The bed-base, when the mattress and the base are joined as Siamese sisters, has nothing to make in bedrooms.
Mattresses get some fresh air very badly; it is not necessary to wash him, what becomes fluently auhourd' hui.
And since overnight they sweat normally from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress begins reminding of a big (and blocked) sieve.
For it the specialists refuse to give publicity on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifelong guarantee.
But everything in sound but.
And for it an advice of experience on behalf of the sellers: for a mattress of 120 / 140cm, abandon, for the coating of the mattress, hygiene or washing but add rather a mattress of protection than vouspouvez easily withdraw and wash.
And even if at present it is frequent to fabricate coatings with closing with slide for all group, that is that after the opening there are two parts (for washing and size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the manipulation for the big models (and for the single person) becomes when they are withdrawn a battle between a light weight and heavyweights on a ring.
You have in your bed a rigid board instead of a base?
Never!
At the farthest for a bed intended for the visitors for the single night.
However equip the board (if there is not) of holes of ventilation and use the mattress with springs with a minimal height of 15cm with springs in sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation.
A mattress in polyurethane should not be part of a bed of this type.
For bases with small strips with unique position with 14/18 small strips, mattresses in latex or said sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and of coconut), are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more small strips, 28 and above, where small strips are doubled in the part of the bottom of kidneys and that it is so possible to regulate rigidity.
For mattresses in several positions you should not get mattress from springs because he does not answer the changes of position.
Next to the regulating of the rigidity of small strips it is possible to instal also what is called a cradle of shoulder.
It is about a special link of the small strips which allows to lobby or even to tip up the small strip so that the shoulder of the sleeper "integrates" well.
For the men "with so broad shoulders as with the back," it is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by the producers of mattress who for the "masculine" began using a rammollissante zone at the level of shoulders.
But they also think of the women - they give them once again a more soft surface at the level of hips.
For the most difficult client there are bases with wings or with bars with what is called a suspension multiforce.
Pressure spreads in more points and diinue tension.
But sure, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (big and filled with air) on good mattresses and base, most disparait.
The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tops have to attain shoulders only, so that the muscles of shoulders could have a rest.
Registered size is 50X60 cm which the Scandinavians by exmple prefer.
When they are lengthened on the side, the pillow must put in level (with the cradle of shoulder of the base or the zone rammollie in the mattress) the height of shoulders.
The modern mattresses have some more thing of common with the first based on straw and on grasses.
The producers still use natural subjects or miscellany.
Tendency is also in the mattress bio.
Raw materials based on pétrôle, from which the polyurethane is fabricated, are replaced with natural oils, as for example of the soya oil.
Almost all known producers just use the soya.
"The qualifier Bio for mattresses means that the heart is fabricated based on natural products," explains vasicek Petr of the society Tropico Plus.
The natural subjects are also used for the coatings of mattresses; one of the first ones was the aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules to it which develop perfumes of the forest or lavender.
There is difference between the man and the woman.
While the extract of plants of birch so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools down the body, "cools down " the man, coatings "heat" the women.
The extract of red pepper speeds up the circulation of the blood and is therefore hotter for weak sex.
The current favourites?
Mattresses fabricated from cold foam (it has more pores with a cellular structure unsettled therefore more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different cold rigidities of the ship's apprentices gives polyzones mattresses who know precisely where is the head, the bottom of the back and the feet.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and more.
Those who are characterised by their parametres for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments to be health.
In Czech Republic, it is Gumotex who attained the first place.
To economise for the mattress and the base is not simple.
It is possible to have two mattresses from time to time as part of special actions on behalf of the producers or of the producers for the price of the only one.
As for example the Magniflex society which offers mattresses Duofreeze with the foam with memo Memory sewed in the coating for 11990 crowns.
It is possible to take the second of course free.
The lazy epoch of the ship's apprentices or the viscoélastiques with an opened cellular structure and a big thickness was started with material Tempur with a "cosmic" rhythm.
It began as material for NASA PARCEQUE the astronauts suffered in the starting of the huge power loads.
Tempur rammollit in heat and hardens, on the contrary, in cold.
He fits therefore perfectly to the hot human body and distributes him an optimum pressure.
It is for it ideal against the slept trouble and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
The ship's apprentices viscoélastiques use not only for mattresses but also for products for health, as special cushions for the feet which relieve legs and venous system.
The Czech producers use for example the foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or the same type.
One to follow people more and more asks by the parents for apparatus who want to watch their children.
The fright for their child leads more and more people to think of watching them through GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search cars can be used just as well to draw the movement of the persons and to help for some cases as by exmple that of the baby Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as one limps with matches but will soon be the size of one watch.
Case of the baby Anicka moved a big number of persons and they began searching the means to protect their children better.
Even if price is to fluster their private life.
"We try hard to say all that it is not about spying but only about another means to diminish likelihood that there is another tragedy," declares Petr Pilin of the MACRO society Weil which is one of the suppliers of apparatus of tracing on the Czech market.
"I confess that there can be cases of bad job of such apparatus, as for example put it in the bag of a person who does not know, but I have not met such cases yet."
"The majority of people are clients who indeed buy the product for reasons of security, adds Pilin.
According to him the children should always know for which aims is used "limps it" and how use it in an emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not feel like carrying on him a thing of this type, it if in débarassera.
'And even the smallest can show a big creativity when it is a question of getting rid deliberately of something when they do not want to be under control."
"Mobile phones, which can cut themselves as these apparatus of tracing, have already brought the parents to long waitings," asserts Bockova.
According to her, fact that this type of apparatus could help in case of attack very debatable.
"If it is about a prepared abduction, the author is going to make everything so that the child does not have electronic apparatus which could locate him."
"Currently, it is the telephone."
"As soon as the equipment of tracing is going to develop, they (the criminals) are going to search them too because sale will be supported by a campaign of advertising."
"In such cases the criminals will always be early on the police," says the psychologist.
She confesses however that such apparatus can help during an unready attack by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the society RC MONITORING, which offers services of tracing so much for the cars which for the persons, asserts that to have this type of apparatus can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an attack.
"The apparatus can be defined so that it is in regular programme after determined period."
"In case the apparatus is destroyed, there remains however the last position of the person concerned."
'The more expensive apparatus also have an inclinomètre who signals immediately the position of the person which slid and is in position lengthened without moving," points out Cech.
According to him the clever said mobile phones which are equipped with a system of navigation, can offer a comparable service having formatted it with a special prosoftware.
The problem of the current systems of tracing is that it is belongs of a similar apparatus to those who are carried in pendant of the size of one limp with matches is in the smallest telephone apparatus.
It is always possible to lose them.
According to Pilina of the society Macro Weil, that is why tests are currently led to make apparatus which resemble common numerical watches.
"It will have advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to admit the apparatus of tracing."
"Or he will realise it after some time, what will have given to the police a little more time," he adds.
That the apparatus of tracing is developed in the form of bracelet or of pendant, it always utilisiera the same technology as to draw cars.
It is about a combination of systems of acquisition of a position by means of GPS (which is fluently used in autonavigation) and of a function of a mobile phone which alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonator fuses as she could go around the Czech Republic with. But she can hold only two years.
The army bought for 445 km of matches used for explosives.
Already the last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has reservations therefore for 225 years.
Problem is that the life of matches is from two to four years old maximum.
The army bought detonator fuses from the public company STV GROUP for 40 million crowns.
The general staff gave as reason of the achât of a huge quantity of detonator fuses to MF DNES where the soldiers use 60 km a year.
According to spare calculations to keep facts by the pyrotechniciens of the army, that MF DNES contacted, it emerges from it that even the generals, the officers in command, secretaries or the domestic personnels should have an exercise every year in explosives.
Alexander Vondra, Defence Minister and Vlastimil Picek, commanding of the army do not make exception.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of 60 km of detonator fuses.
At this distance corresponds 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the reservations of the army could meet it for 10 years.
If on the contrary it would be true that for the entrainement of base of each of the new professionals it is enough in most than 2 m of detonator fuses, as say it the experts, it means that the army with its new purchase assured - with also the consumption of special units and of genius - reservations for 225 mentioned years.
However the soldiers of the brigade of quick intervention have recently complained to the minister Vondra that they almost have not ammunition as their handguns and that the sessions of shooting are limited because of needs of money.
Regarding the lack of underwear they do not speak about it.
"And I am not taken the head if they buy at our place such a big quantity of detonator fuses."
"And it is their decision and they really know what they make."
"for us the army is a good client that we try hard as dealers to satisfy," says sales manager of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues the achât of hundred of km of detonator fuses due to the fact that the army will have this "ammunition" in reservation for 10 years.
Jan Decky de STV Group mentions however of only four years of life of detonator fuses and pyrotechniciens of the police and of the army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in stores, it can go even until four years," says one two who does not want that the name is published taken into account the criticism of the army.
The crossed delay of life, every munition must be tested to see if she remains honest and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
These tests are not however free and still cost some money.
The other argument of the ministry is a discount due to quantity for 445 km of explosive cordeux.
"They cost us 60 for one hundred at least than the supply of 245 km last year," points out the spokesperson Pejsek who makes the interpreter in the opinion of purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the detonator fuses of the pyrotechniciens of the police who neutralises the ammunition of World War II or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 metres.
And the police orders always only the necessary quantity of ammunition to be used before the end of their life.
It was established for reasons of security of pyrotechniciens and to be able to get from it more in a more flexible way types of more modern and more reliable detonator fuses.
the Ministry of Defence has big problems today as the neutralisation of dozens tons of ammunition coming from the time of the Pact of Warsaw when the Czechoslovakian army strong in two hundred thousand men got ready to move, cape on the Rhine.
What waits over the years for this Czech army that MF DNES contacted: neutralise hundreds of kilometres of old detonator fuses which she buys today "cheap ."
Untill today I take advantage from contacts which I got thanks to competitions.
The sale under frankness of its hotel helped well Lukas Pytloun for the place of victor of the competition of the best individual Businessman.
The victor of the competition of the best individual Businessman for last year was Lukas Pytloun, 28-year-old businessman.
His adventure towards the succés is as in a film.
Lukas Pytloun wanted to travel.
And abroad, he realised that in Libérec a site of quality accommodation to a reasonable price was missing.
His savings on what he had earned when he worked on foreigner and with the help of a banking loan he bought a small building of 5 flats half demolished.
Knowing that he was still student in trosième year of higher education, it was an audacious action.
"The report between quality and price of an accommodation in our region gave me desire to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began the first flat rebuilt to the foreign workers has rent.
He reinvests the benefit in the building which he transformed into pension with 54 beds.
Since this instant, his businessman's action allowed him to open in Libérec 4 pensions, two restaurants of style and two hotels with a complete capacity of about 300 beds of any categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was until everything recently four stars Pytloun designs hotels.
This year other one of identical quality arrived to him there.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel to Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of frankness and of other candidates for the frankness of hotels Pytloun manifested themselves," the number 1 of businessmen of last year.
"And for the sale of the licence for the putting into service of a large-scale hotel the victory in the competition of the businessman of the year served well, adds Pytloun with gratitude.
Victory brought him more popularity and to be known in Libérec and its vicinity.
"People admitted me on streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, that it was very nice," he reminds.
He recommends the participation in this competition to all those who try hard to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says that he uses untill today his contacts and knowledge which he would not have been able to get from other way.
"With those whom I met thanks to competition I began maintaining trade relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation linked to the succés had an impact also on the employees.
And he has 70 of it about.
"I notice at home especially fidelity and pride to have got involved in something that was admitted in general."
"It is not, and from a distance, the only result of my personal job, but the result of a great work of us all together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," says Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish to my successor a better year than the one that we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rpidement replaced by the effects of crisis.
Thanks to the sense of objective of winning Farmet has the worst instants behind one.
The one who came to search price in Slovansky dum for the first place of the organised competition for the Business company of the year by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the society Farmet.
Jury rewarded efforts with which it transformed a workshop of tools in Ceska Skalice into a business company in the turnover of 100 million crowns.
'I can say that reward encouraged my collaborators not only me my also and augmented our self-confidence to struggle against competition," declares winning today of the competition of last year.
At the beginning of the history of the society Farmet there was the desire to do something of useful.
And so when the state offered to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop by way of compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, refused a career in a business company where he worked at that time and created a society with some friends in the circle of his father for the manufacture of tubs in plastics.
Not for a long time afterwards they began specialising in presses for vegetable oil.
He became after eighteen years the biggest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The society was even known in the public not specialised after the succés got in competition through media.
"Not only our clients really better began knowing mark Farmet but also foreign partners who began realising that they collaborated with a society which got the biggest succés in its country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the past year not e took place in Farmet only ldans the euphoria of victory.
The valuation of the society had been made from the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009.
And just in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machines of engineering.
To the highest of the crisis, which really did not touch the citizens, societies were obliged to stop their plans of investments and to begin limiting their achâts of new equipments and technologies.
"We did not avoid this situation of course."
"Turnovers fell from 40 for one hundred, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time it is necessary to take unpopular measures.
But they managed situation correctly and kept bénéficiares results even if they were less than those that they had before crisis.
However in Farmet, they went on without compromise to be invested in research and development.
"We constructed with allocations a training centre and research centre, reinforced the presentation of the society in living rooms-exhibitions international and earned main rewards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything lets us to think that crisis is behind them.
The figures of affires go back up and with them number of employees also.
"To the new victor I wish this nice feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The inquiry which abolishes insane regulations.
The inquiry into the Absurdity of the year is for the fourth time a part of the clan of business.
Some absurd regulations could be abolished.
The not very glorious victor of this year of the inquiry into the Absurdity of the year was the obligation to bring in the offices of the documents that the civil servants can get online.
More than third party of 4000 voters voted for it.
For example, administrations of social affairs asked a paper extract of the register of trade while the civil servant can get it in two mouse clicks.
this changes thanks to the inquiry.
"The Czech administration of social insurance will ask no more for extract of the register of trade for the controls of payments of insurance," pointed out Jana Buranova, spokesperson of the Czech Administration of social insurance (CSSZ).
Bring to light all regulations and decrees which societies and businessmen have to fill in Czech Republic and make abolish those who are absurd is the sense of this competition of the Absurdity of the year.
This inquiry is even this year for the fourth time a part of the clan of business organised by Hospodarske noviny and has another bigger popularity.
If on year 3000 voters manifested themselves, it is at least 4000 this year who brought their voice.
And it is not amazing, he ya in our country the most various lawful obligations which are only slowing the firm down, and, it, more and more.
"We are perhaps to the number of documents to be filled for tax statements in the first places in the world," declares Karel Havlicek de l' Association of small and medium enterprises and the businessmen of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of businessman's activity becomes a proclaimed purpose by all governments these last years.
Compared with the whole world the situation in Czech Republic improves in no way.
According to the World Bank the Czech Republic is in 74 ème place as for conditions for the firm, that is 8 places more in comparison with last year.
The competition of the Absurdity of the year was set up for the first time in 2006 and goes on every year according to the same scenario.
Whoever can mention every year of administrative and bureaucratic absurdity from April to the end of September, last delay before the fence of competition.
To give an account him ya the site web www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the organizer of competition chooses seven candidates as antiprice " and lets the public vote during October on the site www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity which accepted the biggest number of voices is declared victor.
Up to the last inquiry of last year, it is a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and décrêts who lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by the businessmen but also the professional unions and the professors.
Among the "finalists" of competition, therefore among the nominating obligation is for example that the vehicles of maintenance of motorways and of expressways pay tolls, either that businessmen with twenty employees, repaint two offices and two toilets every other year.
the list of seven proposals is published on the site of competition.
The proclamation of competition, which begins always at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a happening in which participate regularly personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, head of the Association for the small and medium enterprises of Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, president of the Chamber of commerce of Czech Republic, assisted at the culminating instant competition.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts âtons in the legs of the businessmen and for it my objective is to abolish, every year, at least three dozens paragraphs which today are only complicating the firm," in declared Martin Kocourek, the Minister of industry and of trade.
Effort to abolish absurd décrêts is not a blow of sword in the water.
In 2007, what did not please people was the obligation of the businessmen to declare three days before to the office for the individual firm in the place where is firm, intention d' to go to an exhibition or a pélerinage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the ammendement of Law on the individual firm.
The second obligation most approved by a large majority in 2007, which was to declare to the Office of job a service trip for a foreign employee on 30 days, was abolished with the text of Law on what is called the certificate of motor insurance.
And everything is ok up to the third session of competition.
The Absurdity of year 2009 was the décrêt for the physical therapists to have a big mirror in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
It was changed by prescription of the Ministry of Health the year it last obligation to have a refrigerator was abolished.
A new category rewards the responsible business companies socially.
The ecological, humanitarian plans, of training or else sportsmen are assessed.
The novelty of this year of the competition of Hospodarske Noviny, which exists already for 5 years, is the category called the Responsable business company of year 2010.
The onjectif of this competition is the support of the fair and reasonable firm.
"We want to support the societies which watch the impacts of their firm on environment and lead a socially responsible activity," points out Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the operator of mobile phone, the Vodaphone business company, which is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of competition for the rebel of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the business company of year 2010, organised by the business company Vodaphone, the societies registered which have no succés with long-term single objective as the firm.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to edit.
Although the object of their firm differs one of other one it is possible to consider their activity of support and prediction as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, it concerns handicapped persons and personal problems or of health of their employees.
Among fourteen finalists for all Czech Republic the society of prosoftware pragoise And Netera is not example who supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who participate then in number of tournament in different sports disciplines.
Another example of business company responsible for the region of Pardubice is the Isolit-Bravo society which is for 17 years the main contributor in the fund of allocation which sponsors the handicapped children.
In fact to take care of employees having problems of health, it is possible to name still The old plant of manufacture of paper of Podebrad which uses more than 70 for one hundred and that, for it, got the title of the Responsible business company for the region of central Bohême and that was situated third in the region in the competition of the Business company of the year organised by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MIRYZ SOFT, a financial society, who won to have introduced softened up working timetables and even diminished till 35 am a week on average and, it, without, proportionellement, reduction of wage.
Shone déverné jury also announces it because she achête first and foremost to the Czech producers, supports a ditoyenne activity in close circle and is concerned about environment.
"We try hard to recycle the most possible so that our activity of firm and our administration have least impact on environment," explains Miluse Ryznarova, the executive head of the society.
the responsible IT ENLOGIT society of the Region of Usti also thinks of the health of its employees and set to them up for every laptop computer an ergonomic chair and a keyboard, encourages their working from home and uses services of catering of a local protected plant for its actions.
"We support foundation besides The man in the shadow which helps the community local Rom," says Ondrej Suchy the representative of the society.
In the very last rank a society of Washing and cleaning of the region of Karlovy Vary is, also for its activities, which participates in insurance reprocess his employees in the form of no-claims bonus above standards.
"In our society we contribute to the food, the transport, increase of skills and to leisures," says Joseph Strapac of the building society of bruntal Czasch, victor for the region of Moravia-Silesia.
Responsible society, all regional finalists for the competition of the Business company of the year of Vodaphone were automatically registered in the category, who had answered questionnaires in in room linked by the document for inscription and had returned it to the organizer before August 15th.
The incomplete or badly filled answers in the questionnaire were withdrawn from competition by the organizer.
"If the representatives of business companies in lists had not answered questions, they could participate in the competition of the Responsible business company but were not not disqualified of "main" competition the Business company of the year of Vodaphone."
"Independent inscriptions are not possible because it is about a subcategory of the main competition of the Business company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organising agency Bison&Rose.
In the Fund for Lands in Plzen, the police undertook arrests in the course of public competition
In the building of the Fund for Lands in Plzen, police anti-corruption undertook arrests these last days.
The detectives crossed handcuffs to the local and commercial businessman in real estate Lubos. G.
This one had tried hard to manipulate just a public invitation to tender for the regulations of a request of restitution so that the offered ground is got by a determined candidate.
This one had to pay to Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"At the moment I can only confirm that the police follows a person for insider trading as part of a public invitation to tender and call of a concour." leader of the Public Prosecutions of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing declared for the newspaper Pravo that it is forbidden to give more explanation because the inquiry is under way.
The policemen delayed after 24 hours this 46-year-old businessman on freedom.
To know how he could have an influence on a public competition, it is possible only to speculate taken into account in if not enough official information.
In a question of Pravo, the spokesperson of the Fund of Fields Lubomira Cerna pointed out that the policemen had indeed undertaken an arrest in Plzen on a separated workplace and, it, in the course of public competition.
"It was about a client and under any circumstances about an employee, she specified.
Public competition according to Surrounded has as true name "Call to be offered of rights for the transfer of fields according to Law on the earth" and is set up when several profitable candidates of right manifest themselves.
"These persons offer to them, as part of call, upper value of rights to resitutions who must be regulated before is announced the value of the ground."
"According to offered rights a classification of the purchasers is set up and the Fund of Fields transfers the ground then to the person who offered the highest rights," explained the spokesperson of the Fund.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, information concerning the persons who had registered in call and as he is, also, a bénéficiare person himself because having bought a big number of rights to restitutions, he had offered to the candidates for the ground not to participate in competition.
And he cashed undoubtedly by fact to leave.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his questioning.
Lubos G. avait des contacte largement au-dessus des les normes au FdT (Fonds des Terrains).
He appeared in the affair of the ex-leader of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was followed in the criminal to have edit fields for which they had already edited the decision of installation of a building.
Just Lubos G. had got for example fields intended for the building of public communications, in concrete terms in loco where must be constructed the artery of accés in the industrial zone of Borske Pole.
Later he exchanged him with the city council for a building in the historical centre of the city value of which is superior from far away.
The city council was obliged to accept because otherwise she risked jeopardising the building by a blockage of fields.
Household is going to pay a supplement of a hundred of crowns monthly for the accommodation.
Household will have to from January pay a supplement not only for all types of energy but also for water and cleaning up, the supplies of heating and in some places rents will also augment.
Families will have to therefore from January pull of their purse up to a hundred of crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity augments 4.6 for one hundred, the gas of almost 2 for more expensive one hundred, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth of more the supply of water and in many places the supplies of central heating will be also more expensive.
The increase of electricity should be near 100 crowns for household in flat anuellement more than currently.
However all suppliers diminished the prices of electricity given sensitive development to encourage the manufacture of renewable energy sources, notably the photovoltaic piles.
The gas augments reasonably but sure at the time when people more need it to heat up and have therefore the biggest consumption.
It is therefore possible to count also a hundred of crowns in more.
Although electricity and gas augment in all Czech republic, the change of the price of the central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the biggest villages which plan increase in prices.
For example household in Pardubice or in Hradec Kraloce will pay almost 50 crowns as from January for the central heating of more a month, the families of Libérec will pay more than 1000 crowns yearly.
For the inhabitants of Prague gets ready an increase of 9 for one hundred for water and cleaning up for case where the city augments the rents of facilities.
If rents do not change pragois will pay a supplement of 6.8 for one hundred.
The price in Prague will be still part of the lowest compared with the country entirely.
In Bohême of the north, where prices are already part of the highest, water and cleaning up augment 7.4 for one hundred.
The prices of rents are going to augment for example appreciably in 450 thousand leasable flats from January that is at the end of regulation.
For example the CPI BYTY society which has in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 flats, decided on an increase until 100 for one hundred.
Those who will not agree with the new increase of rents will be translated before courts by the society.
Regulated rents that people in pay about 300 thousand flats could augment next year of 10 for one hundred.
The Czech children saoûlent in the rum and in the fernet. The beer is not any more fashion and acts very slowly.
The fernet, the rum, the vodka and in an exceptional way also the best mark of whisky are stolen from the parents.
It is drinks which bring most often those who saoûlent, who are not another fifteen years old, in the hands of the doctor.
The children on whom one treats in the hospital for repetition do not make exception.
It results from the experience of the doctors who meet similar cases in the admission of departments children of hospitals.
"Beers or wines are not any more fashion because it is needed of time to be a saoûl."
'Tendency is really in strong alcohols," points out for Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of department children of the hospital of Horovice in central Bohême.
"When they succeed in filching a bottle to daddy in the cupboard, it is of sometimes of wisky but it is the fernet and the vodka who predominate'.
"The vodka has this advantage that they can blend it with the fruit juice and so not smell it," explains the Head of department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesperson of the hospital Motol, also gives him reason.
"In general, it is some rum or the fernet."
"It is the alcohol in fashion notably in primary schools today."
"In certain cases, it was about slivovice that they brought back the home," added Jurinova.
According to the head of department Pélikan, to see intoxicated children from thirteen to fourteen years old in admission to the hospital is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice for last year, he was in Motol where he practised ten years just in paediatrics where ambulances brought schoolchildren of the broad completely intoxicated vicinity.
"A girl was so hospitalised four times
"She acommencé the career in twelve years when she was brought with 3.5 for one thousand alcohols dansle blood with more a mixture with the extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was in the Park of Exhibitions of Holesovice in a party."
"What is interesting, it is that he did not appear strange to the mother that his daughter is away 48 hours" said surprised the manager du Département.
It is just the disinterestedness of the parents or their outstanding tolerance facing the fact that their offshoots devote themselves to the drink which are the main reason of the développment of the alcoholism of the children.
According to the specialists, they however do not speak about the dependency, in its strict sense, for the children.
"Under alcoholic term they hear that a chronic dependency in the long-lived alcohol with all phenomena which follow from it but that are not found at the children's."
"To those who use the repeating acool, it is rather about a significantly disadvantageous socio-family background," explained the head of department Pélikan.
According to the spokesperson Jurinova, about forty intoxicated children were hospitalised this year until mid-November in the private hospital of paediatrics in Motol.
Cases with a grâve intoxication requiring the hospitalisation are included into the stastistiques only.
The intoxicated children who are after the urgent care brought back at home by the parents or by the police, are not counted.
Besides cases of the children which sit down and drink a bottle of alcohol after the school, he exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves with whom it is possible to count: the day of the sorceresses, sylvan saint and the school end of year.
"Or they drink by disappointment after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of holiday."
"Of course I lived in the day of the sorceresses an admission of 7 intoxicated children all at once," underlined Pélikan.
The intoxicated child who crossed at night in the hospital désintoxciation there under medical supervision is paradoxically in better position than the one who came back at home and suffers the day after "hangover."
The headaches of morning caused by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutritious elements which organism needs.
"They are for it better shared out since they cross a very good party then a soft waking and nothing hurts them."
"They are only surprised of the place where they are," adds Pélikan knowing that from time to time it spoils the good mood of the patients at least with the note to be paid for their care.
The transport by ambulance and the hospitalisation on bed of intensive care can go up to dozens thousand crowns.
"From time to time, I applied it as a means of education by counting to these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend all summer in seasonal job to reimburse the single party," added Pélikan.
However, according to him, the companies of insurance of health in their managements in decline, which should recover on behalf of the parents expenses linked to care, do not treat cases of intoxicated children.
Two planes L-159 are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two planes L-159 of the five there everything, counters who the Ministry of Defence exchanged transport planes Casa C-295M, took off on Tuesday for Séville in Spain where assembles the producer of planes Casa-EADS.
It is the first time that apparatus of this type become the property of somebody else than the Czech army.
They were however abroad as part of exercises or of flights of demonstration.
It is two-seater versions of L-159T1 which were up to now in service in the Czech army and that were in a fit state of flight.
Lestrois remaining apparatus are single-seater versions of L-159.
These park at the moment at the place of Aéro Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol business company - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the department of press of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the planes of Vodochody is unknown at the moment.
'The single-seater planes L-159 envisaged for exchange were taken on planes stocked for a long time without its causing expenses or additional investments for the Ministry of Defence."
"Two-seater L-159 T1 was exchanged in the state," declared for Pravo Pejsek.
He jousted that the army will not stay without two-seater since the ministry signed in May, 2009 with Aéro Vodochody an agreement worth 200 unused million crowns for the transformation of four one-seaters L-159 in two-seater two.
The army took delivery of the first apparatus in July, the second being envisaged in delivery at the end of this year.
According to PEJSEK EADS promised to introduce planes into the equipment of some countries of Alliance.
"In the contract it is apparently pointed out that the one who takes planes L-159 in count is EADS and that they will serve in the entrainement of the pilots of country members of NATO."
"It is as a result the affair of the one who takes into account to determine how to accomplish it," pointed out Pejsek.
Hospodarske noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested by L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a plane Put and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 thousand million crowns was ratified last year by the government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence did not make appeal of offer and contacted EADS directly.
the direction of defence argued while exchange assures a future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought in Aéro Vodochody 72 apparatus and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of planes Put aura probably of judicial involvements.
the European Commission however lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of justice because planes should have been chosen as part of an invitation to tender Europe-wide and under any circumstances by contacting a producer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three planes the last Put, should come on the airport of Prague Kbely in two weeks.
A longer index than the annular is a sign of weak risk of cancer
The men with the longer index than the annular are displayed to a lesser risk of having a cancer of the prostate.
It is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
It can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our conclusions show that the relating length of the finger acts as simple test of risk of cancer of the prostate, notably for the men before 60 years," proclaimed co-author of study Ros Eeles, professor in the Institute for research on cancer to the university of Warwick.
The finger could so help to determine which men should submit to the test of the cancer of the prostate, notably by combining with genetic risk or other aggrâvants factors as the family antécedents of health, added Eeles.
During the period of 1994-2009 it followed with his colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients attained by a cancer of the prostate and at the same time about three thousand healthy men.
More half of the participants in study had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular.
For them as for 19 for one hundred those who had the fingers of the same length, they found the same likelihood of a cancer of the prostate.
In the case of those who had the longer index than the annular risk however fell to 33 for one hundred, for the men before 60 years the reduction of risk attained 87 for one hundred.
The report of length of both named fingers - formed during prenatal period - notably points out levels different from sexual hormones at which is exposed the child in the uterus.
Unless testosterone a longer index corresponds.
Previous researches had shown that it is just testosterone which foreign aid of a cancer of the prostate.
The pprofesseur Vacla Paces, renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of sciences, said for CTK that he knows about this study but that he does not seem to him, he parried, that the relation between the length of fingers and the cancer "is completely shown."
The Czech Republic is under the snow, D1 and D5 motorways are closed.
Tchéquie as most Europe is on Thursday morning covered by the snow.
On roads and pavements, there is mostly some compact snow, déblayeurs worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning the 89th and the 93rd kilometre towards Rozvadov because of several accidents of lorries and of cars enters and the auroute D1 in Brno towards Prague suffers the same fate.
Le dispatcher de Le de l'Automobile le club central (UAMK) l'a dit aux les renseignements
In the 91th kilometre a lorry was bumped, in the 93rd two heavyweights collided, accident made injured men.
Several cars also met in the ditch.
Problems are also on the motorway D1 in 185 ème kilometre towards Prague.
Two lorries collided there
The drivers should go out just after Brno to the 190th kilometre or to go by Brno and to enter the 182nd kilometre then to Kyvalka.
A queue of cars of several kilometres formed in this place.
Also on the motorway D11, there is an accident and, it, just at the arrival to Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow of several centimetre in thickness, thermometers point out - 7 degrees Celsius.
Queues of cars create for example to Prosek, the street Sterboholska is also blocked.
The surest means of transport is the underground.
Trams take delay for example on the line between the Place Charles (Karlove Namesti) and the Place of peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock the crisis staff of Prague must again meet.
Railways and airport also meet problems.
The Czech Railways have must abolish because of the snow 7 links of expresses.
Lines for example from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun have problems
The passengers should control current situation.
The airport of Ruzyne was closed since Wednesday 11 h 00 at night till 5 am.
Most roads in Moravia of the South is already roulable but by staying down alertness.
On the road of Vyskov, three lateral roads are impassable, on the road of Brno it begins having by places of the gusts of snow and on the road there from Blansko chaines are compulsory to pass some ways of communications in places put higher.
The region of Vyskov was part of the most affected places.
Up to now are closed axles: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it will perhaps be necessary to send déneigeuses and strawberries to snow.
It is not possible to estimate at the moment when they will be roulables.
On the road of Hodonin the caution am essential in the region of white Carpathes.
On the roads which are, taken into account the protection of nature, maintained only by the sprinkling of inert products, there is however a layer of 5-centimetres of snow informs CTK.
In Tchéquie, he fell between two-10 centimetres of snow; he fell most in Bohême of the north, with, often, up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the region of Moravia-Silesia, he fell up to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow coverage disparait in Tchéquie progressively.
The Americans have a new "clever weapon"
The American army sent in Afghnistan a new "clever " weapon, known only under the name of code XM-25.
The generals think that this new automatic gun will have an influence on conflict there with the Taliban and "go to change game" in their benefit.
The new weapon is as a definite great cannon
His projectiles are guided by laser with a some metre precision.
The special ammunition of 25 mm calibre developed for this gun and containing a highly high-explosive explosive, work in fact as small grenades.
It is possible to program ammunition so that they will blow up in the contact of the target but also in any point of their ballistic trajectory.
It is therefore possible to use it against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, a wall or a ditch.
He is not either protected from above and when falls it over a bloody rain of brightness of steel, it can put him out of battle also.
According to Richard Audette who took part in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon of infantry which uses "clever" technology.
"The soldier uses it principally so that he finds the target, sends him a ray laser which determines distance, gets so a definite point of aim, according to which it corrects its aim site and presses on relaxation.
"Let us say that you aimed at 543 metres."
"When you press relaxation, the weapon takes responsibility and draws at 543-metre distance more or less 1, 2, 3 metres, pointed Audette out.
400 delocalized jobs
The Fujitsu group delocalizes its subsidiary of Bad Homburg towards Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 collaborators are going to transfer to Astro Park their workplace who is currently in the office block of the Place Mareinbader in the region of Bad Homburg.
The Japanese Fujitsu group delocalizes its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As asserted it on Wednesday the giant specialised in manufacture and service of computers, next year in July, workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on the place Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred in Astro Park, huge complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße of the District Niederrad of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should regroup 100 other jobs still scattered until now in the region there.
The offer of renting was extremely delightful. Moreover, offices with aerie opened by Astro Park are better suitable for the working mode of the collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was fair tenant.
The managing director, Bernd Wagner, declared: "Frankfurt-Niederrad constitutes for us a primordial site having remarkable facilities."
He maintains that connection in the airport Fujitsu is just of a big importance for a total firm as.
The new move of an important firm inside the region provoked the joy of the winning yesterday and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The representative for the economic business of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), declared that once again, a "planetary actor" has so been won.
It is a "extraordinary relating declaration of faith instead of establishment."
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and the establishment constitutes an impetus mattering for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr Michael Korwisi greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
Direction very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It goes without saying that we offered to help this firm," declared Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relations would have been able nothing to change in difficulties of the producer of computers facing the owner of the building of the Place Marienbader.
When all is said and done, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is a question from now on of avoiding that such an exceptional place remains unoccupied for a long time.
"I have the hope that the owner and lessor of the building will prove to be co-operative."
Ten years ago, the building of the Place of the Town hall, used until now by the society Fujitsu and the "vertical baby" is placed side by side, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial plan of building of the spa.
Fruit of a joint plan of the municipality and of a developer of plans private, a new entrance of the city was created between the railway station and the Town hall. This one provoked many criticisms, not only because of the impressive development of the surfaces which acted in the past partly as parking, but also because of the height of buildings.
In 2001, the society of notation and of advice in investment, Feri, the producer of computers for the systems of distribution of trips, Starting Amadeus, so that Fujitsu, producer of computers in epoch still linked to Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, The German group of specialised Frankfurt Immobilien-Chancen bought back buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the property fund Morgan Stanley. One year later, these buildings were sold retail to the Spanish society Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group the seat of which is in Tokyo considers itself to be the third biggest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, she makes available computers and servers to firms and also assures essential service.
His branch established in the region of the Rhine-hand is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu counts surely much more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to become established in Frankfurt-Niederrad. Other present subsidiaries in this site are Fujitsu Services and a firm named TDS.
For it, 7000 square metres rented in the building Astro Park.
This old complex of twenty years, the name of which reminds of its plan in the form of star, shelters between others the seat of the Confederation of electronic and electrical engineering industry.
Expulsion of the server by Amazon - Threats against Mr Assange
Wikileaks feels more and more difficulties.
The supplier of Internet services Amazon evicted from his servers the site specialised in the revelation of confidential documents.
This attitude hides perhaps political pressures suffered afterwards publications of the hundreds of thousand secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, stays obviously in England.
In the United States, the site Wikileaks is attacked with always more force.
The group of cyber-activists " Wikileaks " has no more access to its server accommodated until now in America and searches a hébergeur from now on in Europe.
Meanwhile, the distinguished American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called other countries and firms to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is searched by Interpol, stays probably in Great Britain, according to information published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks exclu du serveur l'Amazone."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," pointed out on Wednesday (the hour place) the cyber-activists at the origin of revelations via social network Twitter.
Shortly before, the cyber-firm, Amazon, had abolished the documents of Wikileaks of its servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the cyber-activists had recourse to the Service Web of Amazon (AWS) to be able to attain the biggest number of accesses to documents.
Across Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Tremendous, our dollars are spent from now on on taking care of people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression poses a problem to Amazon, "they should cease selling books."
The television channel CNN, naming the office of Mr Liebermann, brought back that Amazon forbade Wikileaks to use its servers after the inquiry led by the collaborators of the senator Joe Lieberman.
The president of the committee of the Senate for the protection of the territory had threatened the site Amazon to orchestrate a boycott towards him/her, brought back the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have wished that Amazon takes this measure earlier taken into account the previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information" the senator asserted.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks acts in an illegal, monstrous way and without scruples. It making, it endangers our national security and in danger life everywhere across the world," according to a press release of senators independent.
"No firm aware of its responsibilities, that she is American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks to broadcast the contents of the stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, who is searched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, appears on the list of persons searched by Interpol.
According to information broadcast by the newspaper of London " The Independant ," the 39-year-old Australian saw in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where there happens he.
The cyber-activist always qualified as intrigues orchestrated by his detractors chases hired towards him/her by Sweden.
The spokesperson of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, declared in London that threats were hurled against the site.
"Appeals were even made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange was particularly feared for the security, declared Hrafnsson.
It is so why the founder of Wikileaks continues hiding.
Hrafnsson reacted apparently to statements made in North America.
In America, the ancient republican governor of the Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that representatives for revelations made by Wikileaks is followed and carried out for treason.
In Canada, the adviser of the head of government Mr stephen Harper declared on television, on obviousness in an ironic way, that Mr Assange should "be killed" and that Mr Obama could "use Drone."
Meanwhile, a debate started between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesperson of the president American, Mr Barack Obama, qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that assange Mr demands the resignation of the Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if this one was responsible for order given to the diplomats, and disclosed very recently, to devote himself to activities of spying.
"I do not know exactly why we must take care of the opinion of an individual possessing a Website," declares Mr Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are more important than the affirmations of a site web."
The American government crosses from now on completely to the test bench the protection of its databases.
According to a press release of the White House, Mr Russell Travers, deputy manager of the Centre of anti-terror struggle, was named responsible to struggle against escapes.
Mr Travers is made responsible for setting up " the necessary structural reforms " made necessary after disclosures of the diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to prove means by which all administration exchanges and protects information.
Besides, the American government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of the dissidents and of the activists if ever these were threatened by the revelations of Wikileaks.
"We implemented everything to get into contact with them" the spokesperson of the State department, Philip Crowley pointed out.
"We are ready to protect them if it proves to be necessary."
The university of the Ice
In '"Gelato university" from Bologna, the confectioners of ice for the best seasons of the year are prepared.
The introductory course of three days organised aimed at the future glaciers had a very big success and attracted the visitors come from everybody entirety.
In fact, where from comes all ice?
Du Glacier et de la la machine à glace.
The glacier, that is to say in German the confectioner a little gone out of fashion of ice, fabricates the cream according to all rules of the Italian art of manufacture of the ice.
The turbine with ice takes away the cream of ice of the window refrigerated with the aid of a spatula, the refreshed in the waffle and then begins selling it.
For knowledge, they do not need to go to Anzola dell' Emilia to the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know about it more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian business company Carpigiani.
The producer of ice-cream makers founded the university of ice in 2003 so that creams of ice taken out from its machines answer high Italian ideals everywhere.
The introductory course of three days organised aimed at the future glaciers had a very big success and attracted the visitors come of everywhere in the world.
The special courses concerning the ice of chocolate and stretching on several days are also given. Also, practical sessions are organised in the private glacerie.
In the middle of the crisis of quarantine, some persons dream about a new career, others dare simply to accomplish their burning desire on the smooth ice.
This time, they are 40 participants come from 19 countries of all continents, of Brazil to Saudi Arabia by way of Hungary.
Jacky, professor of art education come from the California is keen of movement Slow dance Food. He wants to offer in future an European quality product in the country of the industrial Ice.
Anke of Berlin advisor in management of firm is and she wants, after some years, to draw some thing of peculiar of this job feeling for nerves.
Two Egyptian young people dream to open a glacerie in Cairo.
A man native to Malta and other one come from Brazil would like to improve the quality of the dairy ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning woman came because her children love Italian dairy ice creams.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari explains first to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ice.
Good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency is decisive not only.
However, Luciano does not forget in the course of the training the cherry on the cake of national superstructure and, in general, of south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then she keeps another sacred dose of Romanticism."
The first stage in manufacture seems completely simple.
Luciano pours basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a big mixer which heats everything to 85 degrees favour an electronic programme, then gets cold immediately to four degrees.
It opens then a tap installed on the machine: he takes from it out a white cream of pasteurised base, foundation of all kinds of ice to the milk.
The training officer is immediately attacked with question: Is it possible to fabricate the ice by using natural substances only without stabilizer?
How is it possible to give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warns against fact to be allowed to mislead by spirit of the age.
The one who speaks only about ice "fabricated from natural ingredients," perhaps used stabilizers nevertheless: most often a natural product, for example of the flour of seed of guar got from the bean of from guar.
It is of course possible to fabricate the ice without using stabilizer, only it is necessary to sell it within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the client will crunch nothing else than granules of ice.
Les modifications de Certaines de la masse de basent sont permises.
It becomes more exciting with aromas.
The mister Luciano establishes difference between ingredients that fruits or confectioneries of the supermarket are acquired in the ray.
Besides, there is some powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all attract to pass you of dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should simply try."
Is in the recipes of sorbets in fruits with some sugar and cool fruits.
Is in dairy ice creams fabricated from the mass of white base which, by adding eggs to it becomes a yellow cream and constitutes, when some powder of cocoa, the base of all possible desserts in the chocolate is added to it.
Now, all participants in course have to pass to the use of machines to ice.
Luciano invites them from time to time to fabricate four kinds of ice: vanilla, in the chocolate, in the mocha and in hazelnut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less of aroma of vanilla or of other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of ice in fruits are also subjected to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more purée of fruits: from the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better.
The ice in hazelnuts does not include willy-nilly the taste of the nut, when it is made up to a great extent of hazelnuts.
The ice in the kiwi, very popular, is fabricated from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less of stabilizer.
"Alone a balanced mixture raises correctly the taste of an ice," asserts Luciano.
The manufacture of the ice is an exercise of calculation: if they use the purée of peach with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar has to be reduced in the basic recipe.
A supplement of sugar is necessary for the ice for the lemon.
Luciano introduces an apparatus with which he determines the content of sugar of different types of fruits (the winegrowers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the must of grapes).
Fortunately, pictures make calculations easier.
The manufacture of the ice does not require any more, as in the past, so much physical intervention.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the mixture of available ice is beaten at the same time to make it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures.
In spite of all automations, light breakdowns are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo bedaubs with purée of fruits up and down and, so, splashes his friends of studies when the control of the colossal bowl mixer avoids him.
The mister Luciano is of the opinion that a "incident the similar risk of occurring during every course: it is only a question of time."
The inspectors in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry which tests the culture of the genetically modified plants infiltrated the European Authority of security of food.
This accusation is formulated now by the brain tumour Testbiotech which is considered to be an independent institute for the valuation of consequences of the biotechnology.
"It rings as a theory of conspiracy, but us us informed well," declared on Wednesday in Munich M. Christoph Then, manager de Testbiotech.
Some information mentions what the president of the brain tumour Efsa for the genetically modified plants, Mr Harry Kuiper, as well as other experts Efsa are under contract with the pressure group Ilsi.
This last is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé or Bayer.
Mr Kuiper collaborated in a decisive way on the development of the trial prescripts of Efsa for the genetically modified plants and is, so, apparently in a situation of conflict of interests, according to critics formulated by Mr Then.
Prescripts worked out correspond word for word, by indents, to stands of the pressure group Ilsi and carry so the mark of industry which, at the bottom, would be controlled by authorities installed in Parma in Italy.
It is already the second time when Testbiotech reports a conflict of interest.
A representative of high rank for Efsa has recently joined unconditional or without transitional period the Swiss agroindustrial Syngenta group. It making, It changed camp.
A short time ago, even the Radio of Central Germany (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the authority of the European Union charged with control and industrial lobby, what awakened suspicion as well of the German federal Agency for environment as European deputies.
However, Efsa accepts the existence of no conflict of interest.
An opinion points out that all reliable data, including those of industry as long are exploited as they are of a good professional quality.
They do not forbid to the experts working as for Efsa to tie of contact with this sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr Kuiper supposes that he works for the international institute for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based in the United States.
This organism considers itself to be a neutral forum regrouping the experts who belong, between others, to the domain of sciences, of industry and of politics to assess risks of the biotechnology without being in the pay of a lobby.
In this affair, the independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that the genetically modified plants are accepted without any trial of feeding at the animals and that the impact of these plants on environment is tested.
"We want to know which are, for example, the impact of the genetically modified corn talk in the field" Mr Then asserts.
Current practice consists in testing only the insulated proteins and not every young plant genetically modified, what does not allow to obtain reliable results.
"If risks are not searched, how is it then possible to discover them? "Mr Then about an accusatory tone wonders.
It is also the point of view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientist performs researches since 1994 in the field of genetics and works currently on the polytechnic school of Zurich.
In this region as in the United States, and from now on also in Europe, the sector of industry tries to influence or to discredit the critical scientists.
That is why, there are barely still researchers who are not linked to societies.
In the opinion of firms, critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck maintains that "industry controls research on security."
The stony trace
Uli Gsell obtained it, in total 400 about kilogramme.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of the railway station of Stuttgart with her tube in the back.
There was demo.
It snowed.
History is known: In September, excavatrices had come and a lot of the north wing had begun demolishing.
The world of Stuttgart was not any more the same: Several thousand persons demonstrated against plan S21, transformation of the central railway station of Stuttgart into an underground railway station which will cost several thousand millions.
A lot of the wing was in ruins when demonstration resulted in the stopping of construction work.
Broken 6000, 7000 pieces.
Muschelkalk (the limestone coskittles) from Crailsheim, a loving and rude paving badly constructed between 1914 and 1920.
Mr Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor domiciling in Ostfildern.
He obtained some fragments.
"These stones are relics."
"They have not to disappear."
He declares enthusiastically: "a rock modest and cheap, simple and of the Earth."
He maintaining that by cutting it up in the saw, he smelt the smell of the smoke of cigarette.
Il ne sait pas le bis ce qu'il fera de ce le fragment.
Rocks have time.
Uli Gsell also.
the traces of stones of Stuttgart lead to an ancient munitions store of the French army in a forest located near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stony empire.
This 44-year-old man trades in old stones.
He bought all stones coming from the demolition happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or if they disappear in discharge" he declares in his office located in a hut, which was in the past a guardhouse.
He tells that he made the object of insults and of threats when in September newspapers brought back that he had buy the rest of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he negotiated during whole days with the adversaries of plan S21.
And he explained them that he could make nothing of the whole to oppose to demolition.
And if it takes place, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using stone.
About 200 adversaries of plan S21 later took one of the stony parallelepiped weighing on average 80 kilogrammes value of which is included between 6,50 and 14 Euro.
Some the guard as memory in also while hoping be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 loads suit of a lorry.
About the half thinks it is still stacked up in the forest, the rest being sold for a long time.
Possessing gardens, gardeners landscapists, Individuals.
They came of everywhere and took all what could enter the chest and the trailers.
These stones of scandal of Stuttgart were transformed for a long time into "Mäuerle" or into limitations of the flower beds of grasses.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular" said Mr Rongen.
"this political element had been."
He enters any ground in his car, goes around his large 20 hectare empire.
He studied of right that he left. Later, he undertook to study biology before being later interested in computer science and becoming finally a quarryman.
And a stony amateur.
Il stocke 40000 tonnes.
He accumulates treasures everywhere in Germany.
IL maintains that he is the biggest trader of the ancient stones.
He réfrène.
Stones of sand sculpted artistically are put down on the snow.
"In the past, They were part of the bridge of Marienbrücke in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he asserts enthusiastically.
"My favourite stone."
He sets off who goes up across the forest.
He points at a heap: Pierre of red sand, before, left the railway station of Karlsruhe.
And so on.
"Pretty travertin."
The parallelepiped was formerly part of the stand of Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and of stories, travertin of Cannstatt coming from the prefecture of police, the ruddy granite coming from the cathedral holy Blasien, the tuff coming from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a job, What efforts, what a sweat!
When Mr Rongen thinks that formerly stones were sculpted at the hand and moved with the aid of simple hoists and of carts drawn by beef, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such heritage was put in room."
He did not become rich, even less fabulously rich.
But this quarryman uses 14 persons today. Besides, stonemasons, sculptor, blacksmith, glass blower and gardener became established in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is gratifying," asserts the recycleur of waste.
Shortly, he must go to Cologne.
There also, there are stones to be saved.
Talented struggle to win high potentials
The bar knows a deep inflow.
16 students bump into each other to buy buns from the salmon, some sauce tomato and whites - mangers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
As part of a kind of competition of ideas, they have to speak job about the car of future with the concepteurs of VW, and, by passing, to know the Volkswagen business company.
At present, number firms Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities does not hesitate to go to hand to hand to competition to discover better brains and to get involved, as.
Their mission: Recruit graduate the most gifted as many as possible in amphitheatres before these last arrive on the labour market and before they are wooed by others.
And since universities do not publish statements concerning the performances of their students, they try to spot exceptional talents as part of practical plans and to secure the loyalty of them.
In the second day of the workshop organised to the technical university of Brauschweig the motorised group cajole talents.
A young lady of the service of personnel shares fountain pens, of candies and of cards including the logo of Volkswagen.
She speaks about the calendar of professional practice and of student jobs to young talents; she shows them ways to achieve the surrounding wall of the group.
It is Nico Selle of the technical university of Braunschweig that is responsible for the plan hired with Volkswagen.
For him, there are reciprocal advantages for both parts: "The students get into contact with this industrial sector and win in experience."
"As for the group Volkswagen, he can know the students, look closely at the serious candidates and appreciate those who are taken into account as collaborator."
According to Mr saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What there is once again, it is the offensive with which they try to earn the students.
"In the past, the accent was rather put on professional plan," asserts Mr Selle.
The struggle for conquest of new awarded a diploma will become more bitter.
In property of sectors, firms cannot recruit their collaborators any more by performing a sorting on a kyrielle of candidates.
But they have to extol their reliability and especially woo the highly qualified working force.
It is especially graduate existent of the courses of study of engineering which are in a very good position to negotiate.
According to the association of the German engineers VDI, more than 40 000 engineers' posts remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the predictions of VDI, the space relating to engineer's posts will still expand.
Novel Dykta goes to the hunt for talents as for KPMG, audit firm, office of accounting expertise and of advice.
He organises expensive events aiming at the recruitment of talents, as for example running cruise KPMG-RACE, at a kind of rally-paper where the rivals have to find their way with the aid of co-ordinates GPS.
The firm is so going to send eight promising students next year so that they go through in that way the United States.
The participants can incidentally visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the firm.
The one who must participate in it decides beforehand after two procedures of selection.
Only the cream of the cream of many candidates will fly off for the United States.
According to Mr Dykta, means used for the search of high potentials in universities is more and more important.
"We want to appear from the lot thanks to running cruise."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little of thing"
For the talented hunter that Mr Dykta is, count seems to be there.
"Untill today, we stayed in contact with all persons having taken part the last year in a similar action."
"Some of them are about to end their studies and want to address their requests soon to our firm." he asserts.
Outside the direct amadouement performed in the campus, small and medium enterprises go about things in a completely classical way by participating in the professional fairs where they devote themselves to the talent hunting.
"We try to attain the graduate by participating in the professional living rooms."
"For example, in the living room of solar technologies," points out Mrs Sitha Stübe, human head of resources to Solarworld, producer of photovoltaic panels.
This firm installed in Bonn uses about 1500 persons in Germany.
Mrs Stübe knows the problems linked to the relay.
Currently, 35 posts are put in competition on the site of the firm.
"At present, it is very difficult to endow vacant posts."
"It costs a lot and takes a lot of time," does he assure?
Another means to establish contact consists in passing by the professors of university.
Solarworld established a cooperation with different establishments of higher education, for example, the university of Fribourg.
"The professors point out that the student has the possibility of performing professional practice or of writing his plan of the end of study at our place."
Expensive advertising campaigns are announced at the specialists' of solar energy.
It is for it that the firm tries to make its advertising by heading with other qualities: individual ambience, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often, a big group cannot make it," Mrs Stübe supports, personnel manager.
For a long time the money plays no more title role in job-hunting.
The flexible hours of employment, the baby-sitter or guard of good possibilities of promotion constitute other decisive factors.
According to a study led by the institute Great place to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55th place among 100 better employers of Germany.
The institute constitutes an annual roll of honour of the German employers.
With this effect, he questions the collaborators about their degree of satisfaction in comparison with their job and with its context while looking at conditions - frames of the employees.
Personnel manager Mrs Stübe hopes that this investment will allow to raise the picture of the society to the job-seekers.
"I think that the candidates recover from it especially in external valuation as regards a potential employer," she declares.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) recommends the firms which want to build a good reputation as employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He recommends to his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, it means to take internal measures first of all.
"The best means for an employer to become delightful is to cross by his clean collaborators," he asserts.
It is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the strategy of internal picture, that is to say the creation of the brand image of the employer within his own enrolment.
"the satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When his employees are well treated and that they become identified with the firm, they make all alone the advertising of their employer to their friends and knowledge.
"It's as if they played in an orchestra," declares Mr Kriegler.
Obama curbs new oil boring
There will not be new boring of oil in the gulf of Mexico off the coast of the Florida, southeast State of the United States, in the course of the years to come.
The government of Washington pronounced a ban An equivalent ban and, so, definitely cancelled its initial plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new boring remains at the moment prohibited.
The secretary indoors Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion, in April, of the platform of boring " Deepwater Horizon " that is at the origin of this strict ban. This one must remain in force at least for five next years.
Facing this accident which in costing life to eleven employees and driven to the biggest environmental disaster of the United States, president Barack Obama, subjected to the pressure of opposition and of this sector, had pointed out that he was willing to allow the realisation of new boring in the eastern part of the gulf of Mexico.
The supporters of this solution so want to reduce the dependency of the United States in relation to foreign countries as for supply in oil.
The question of knowledge which carries the responsibility of the destructive oil slick in golf is not solved, to this day, definitely.
The British oil group, which is confronted with requests of indemnity of several thousand millions, is in the centre of accusations.
An investigating committee created by Obama must introduce its conclusions some time in December.
In October, the secretary indoors Ken Salazar had raised the frost of the boring decreed after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, different oil groups had immediately introduced requests relating to new plans of boring.
With more strict measures of controls and of more strict left luggage offices of security, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent authority of control, who discredited itself after many accusations of corruption, makes currently the object of re-form in depth.
At the same time, Mr Obama announced would abolish them profitable tax alcoves of the gas and oil groups.
The actors of this sector warn from now on publicly against the fact that the debit of feeding in the gulf would be distinctly weaker than it is case until now.
"The objective of the government is to kerbs the quick growth of the sector of the gas and of the oil" according to the result of an opinion poll current accomplished in the sector by the audit firm BDO, before the ban of boring pronounced on Wednesday.
Besides, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty which characterises this sector: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments approved in new plans of support were put back up to new order, to the detriment of growth.
The country Ogoni has dried up
The water which runs into rivers is oiled brown; she clears a similar smell to the one who exists in the station of petrol: Because of one escape, thousand millions of litres of crude oil destroyed the country Ogoni in Nigeria.
The men live on flight, on corruption and on the refinement of the oil.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do not exhaust yourselves," throws the ecological activist to the journalists to tranquilize them: "To you today still enough mud of oil in front of the duckweed."
The 37-year-old Nigerian tried to photograph a young person planted in the muddy water up to the chest, as well as the fatty trail which encircles him: This stage seems almost nice in the brightness of water to the colour of the rainbow.
It is not possible to realise that the basement is packed with brown tablecloths of crude oil.
On the bank of the river Bodo-Jetty, Esther Badom tells that, formerly, she gathered shrimps by whole buckets here.
But meantime calm waters completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge quantity of oil flew of an oil pipeline having blown up in the huge marsh.
The fishermen living in the small neighbouring city of Bodo have to row from now on during six hours to attain waters well stocked with fish: The country Ogoni located in the middle of the Hang glider of Niger is considered to be one from the most polluted regions to the world.
All expanse of ravages is blindingly obvious when the marshes of mangrove swamp crossings by courts of waters are covered.
Instead of a clear water, the motor boat cracks a brown cradingue water. Whoever plunges the hand there withdraws it very covered with oil.
Babies' roots of the mangrove swamp appear from the soil as licorices. The insulated palms sadly let hang their palms.
The clouds of birds are searched in vain, as it is habitually met in wetlands: Dices that the engine outboard motor stops, a ghostly silence beats down on this previous paradise which resembles a service station by the smell which it clears.
"What takes place here, it is war against environment" Mr Celestine Akpobari with a sad expression declares: "Our life is characterised by a permanent danger as regards health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where lives Ogoni is a battlefield besieged since dozens years: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered here; the first resistance was organised in 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa this one was later carried out. In 1993, the Shell group had to interrupt its activities of production in this region because these had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today even, the home-come Ogoni is forbidden this society: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are every day pumped thanks to more than 5000 wells of boring and 7000 kilometres of oil pipelines on the whole of the region of the Hang glider, three times big as Switzerland, oil fields of the country Ogoni are unexploited, because situation is there too unstable for this oil group.
Every about hundred metres stand in the water of steel trestles as strange sculptures: "Christmas trees" the heads of holes of boring are very affectionately indicated.
They have until 50 years, the corrosion up to the landmark gnaws at most.
Akpobari thinks that a head of boring of this nature breaks from time to time in piece, because a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to estimates of the experts, more than two thousand million litres poured on the ecosystem in 50 years: Every year, the quantity of oil equivalent to the one who passed in the sea during the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the biggest catastrophic environmental in the humanity history.
Who must carry the responsibility of persistent environmental pollution? the answer to this separate question actor.
For the group Shell, sabotage and siphonage of oil pipelines are responsible of more than 90 pourcent of pollution. The environmentalists for their part consider explosions of the heads of boring and perforated oil pipelines as main reasons.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner reproached the group Shell for applying in Nigeria the norms of security principally less strict than everywhere else in the world: Alone the rate of faults of behaviours is "even higher than alleures."
Some forms appear from mangrove swamps in a place which, seen from a distance, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of dirty grease and installed outside: They is completely bare and cover with dirty grease until the neck.
A fire glitters under one of many barrels which sometimes linked up with pipes, sometimes scattered without motive on the site must be répérés: a small underground refinery.
They make heat the crude oil in the barrel during several hours, they explain Michael, the team leader.
At first, the petrol enters a container by way of pipes, then, at the end of the behaviour of the drops of kerosene fall and some diesel is finally got.
That's how Michael and its four collaborators produce every day fûts four of 300-litre Diesel: "It brings to us back 34 000 Naira," about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the Hang glider take advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the biggest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only the single refinery.
The illegal refiners can sell at a less expensive price than that ridiculously low of barely 40 cents of Euro by litre of diesel: Because they acquire free their raw material.
this one is given by the "protectors" who put the network of oil pipelines pierces it everywhere across the country of Ogoni. According to the experts, the country loses in that way at least 16 million litres of crude oil on the whole of the Hang glider of Niger.
Only a small completely insignificant part of the raw material provisionally stored is illegally cleaned: Networks of organised crime which also count among his members of the politicians and of servicemen of high rank, load the lion's share in oil tankers and sell it cheaply on the worldwide market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate concerning question to know if it is necessary to allocate environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the mode of lax production is purely academic.
"If the oil societies were not received as intruders and if the foundations of the life of the fishermen were not so deeply destroyed, there would be neither sabotage, nor flight and illegal refineries."
But, Meanwhile, the relations of Ogoni especially in relation to Shell so much deteriorated that it was not more a matter than of the withdrawal of the group. "perhaps that the operators having other nationalities, as Chinese, révèleront better."
Then, Michael becomes nervous.
"It's high time that you skedaddle" the robust worker of the oil announces.
"The soldiers can appear to every instant."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by special units of armed forces, they will not certainly make the object of an arrest, but at most they will give them slush money.
Even the soldiers especially native from the north of the country intend to be of benefit as all Nigerians of the raw material.
"From any point of view, this shawl knack made fall our really low country," Akpori regrets.
The investigating officers discover structural defects in the reactors of A380
A380 suffers apparently from a big problem of security.
By examining an apparatus which performed an emergency landing, the investigating officers discovered a possible structural defect which can drive to "catastrophic fault of the reactor."
The Qantas airline wants to lodge a complaint now against the producer of the reactor.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the company Quantas had obviously had more chance until now: In the course of the investigation which she led, the Australian authority charged with the air safety noted that the reactors of some apparatus A380 introduced a serious problem of security, and she warns against a possible structural defect.
This potential fault could draw serious consequences away: She can cause coves of tiredness and escapes at the level of the linking of the behaviour of oil, as it is pointed out in a stand published on Thursday by the administration of ATSB.
She would have been able to drive to a "catastrophic fault of reactors."
Fabricated reactors Rolls-Royce and equipping 20 planes of series A380 are concerned.
The Airbus of the company Quantas, which had to land urgently on November 4th in Singapore, appears among these.
The Australian airline hired judicial proceedings from now on against the English producer of reactors.
She lodged a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court the seat of which is in Sydney. This step gives him the possibility of taking other legal measures against the society.
The manager of Quantas, Mr Alan Joyce, declared that his company would claim damages in relation to the incident happened at the beginning of November.
Rooms broke loose and the carrying surface was harmed during the fire of the engine.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is at the origin of damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must be replaced now in the world.
The Australian investigating officers announced that other tests relating to security will be accomplished on the superjumbos who is also equipped with reactors with questions.
Recommendations of security are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, pointed out the spokesperson of the ASTB, Mr Martin Dolan.
The problem of security is considered as mattering enough to inform all interested parties.
After the emergency landing of its plane, the Quantas airline had immobilised on the soil all its fleet of A380 during week.
Singapore Airlines provisionally immobilised three of his eleven A380.
The Lufthansa company replaced, by measure of precaution, the reactor of A380.
The two-storeyed plane is the biggest civil aircraft in the world.
The snowfall on all territory causes a chaos in transport
Germany very covered with white: In night, the snow fell on almost all country.
Chaos reigns over all roads, trains and planes are immobilised.
At least three persons died in accidents of circulation.
The winter makes shudder Germany: By glacial temperatures, almost all republic is covered with snow at night of Thursday, what drives to chaos in many localities.
In the north and in the East, the cover of snow attains 15 centimetres by places.
The circulation is strongly restrained on several motorways and on many roads.
On national A7 in Flensburg, the personnel of winter service worked in a permanent way, but them could not overcome some snow which did not cease piling up.
Besides, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The federal Office charged with shipping and with hydrowritten form (DSH) expects it of tidal waves take place sweats the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with levels of water possible attain 1,2 m above normal.
The masses of snow on motorways and on federal roads drew serious problems away in Saxony.
That is why the power station of alert of bad time Meteomedia announced the purple level of alert was announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it is the highest level.
By places, he fell 30 centimetres there of cool snow which the cool and strong winds dispersed.
Several lorries and cars remained wedged there at night.
Even in the land of Dresden china-Anhalt, the authorities of police announced serious disturbances on roads.
On the motorway A2, the snow and the wind drew away a break of the circulation and caused corks.
In Thuringia, snowfalls touched A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances of railroad traffic took place in Saxony, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
Main problems are: the snow on railways, trees thrown on railways, catenary or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, it was necessary to interrupt the interregional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg.
In Sallfeld, in Thuringia, a train ICE for Munich had to interrupt its trip.
The firemen and the paramedics had to supply 165 passengers of the train with covers, food and drinks.
Winds of snow swept roads.
Snowfalls drew away many cancellations of flight in the main airports of Germany.
According to a spokesperson of standard and information on flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesperson of Fraport points out that 40 flights were already cancelled in Frankfurt on Hand.
Winter service assures it a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers wedged in the airport are not any more numerous, nevertheless barely 400 beds are put at their disposal there.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a driver of lorry died during a collision with a train in a grade crossing.
The driver of the train was slightly hurt.
Because of present layers of snow on roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a lorry was caught in a grade crossing because the vehicle was immobilised there.
The driver died.
Four passengers were hurt in the train, that is why the road going from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed till the morning hours.
Besides, a 30-year-old woman died when her car made barrel on a slippery surface to Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will be certainly always soft and dusty, but it will swirl in case of light gusts.
But, the wind is going to get weaker.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by violent and quick winds.
It is however cold very, up to less 15 degrees by places.
Deutsche Bank searches a purchaser for its twin towers.
German Bank tries to part from its emblem: According to information brought back by newspapers, this financial institution searches purchasers for its two office blocks located in its seat of Frankfurt.
This building could bring back up to 500 million Euro.
Deutsche Bank has hardly just prettified the seat of the group: The twin towers located in the District of business were updated; in the meantime the bankers had to go back to their ancient service place.
Henceforth, the financial group tries apparently to recover the costs of renovations and it searches a purchaser for its two buildings, as writings it the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland," naming a spokesperson.
This spokesperson did not point out the reasons of envisaged sale.
He declared "we prove if it is more interesting to occupy buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to rent them out again later."
That's how the biggest financial establishment of Germany has already given its seat up, shortly after.
It is only in the middle of year 2007 when the bank had acquired the twin towers for a 272 million euro sum to the possessors of equity capital. She had then rehabilitated them.
Transformations aiming at optimisation at energetics gulped down, according to some indications, about 200 million euro.
A sale would bring back of course a lot of money to the bank.
According to information given by the newspaper, the experts of this sector estimate the value of turns, rechristened meantime "Tours green," at about 500 million Euro.
According to the spokesperson, they do not know currently if buildings will again be sold in a fund belonging to the bank or to the independent investor.
Thousands of persons mourn the miners who perished.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 persons had a thought as the buried miners who were declared dead following several explosions happened in a mine.
It had not been possible yet to take back up bodies because the security situation of the stricken well continues being precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners whose age is between 17 and 62 years had been buried subterranean.
A probe had been introduced into the stricken well, but no trace of survivors had been discovered.
Because of the strong concentration of toxic gases and of other explosions which followed, no rescue team could go down in the mine for reasons of security.
After the second violent detonation, authorities and administration had considered that the miners had no more chance to survive.
Until now bodies could not to have gone back up.
Today, parents and friends organised a holiday in memory of dead.
Thousands of persons had gathered under the sun bursting in Greymouth in the south of the New Zealand island.
They noticed two minute's silences.
To the memory of 29 buried miners, they installed that 29 tables on whom it was possible to see names, helmets and lamps.
Photos and personal belongings, among which clothes and surfboards, also had their place there.
Flags were put at half-mast in front of all public buildings of the country.
The New Zealand Prime minister John Key declared to the participants on memorial holiday that New Zealand fed the hope that the miners would go back up to the surface.
"But they have never returned home."
Mr Lawrie Drew whose son Zen was buried in pits declared that he cannot resign himself to accept the death of his son as long as he will not have seen his rests.
Besides the Prime minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in memorial holiday.
Miners of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion of November 19th.
The first-aid workers began putting a fire out inside the coalpit of the island of the South of the New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when the masses of explosive gases are moved, the burning temperatures inside the mine begin going down.
Go to Hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
The film director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the borders of the ancient type thanks to his film, " Walhalla Rising ," epic poem of the combatant.
Of what public could the Danish film director Nicolas Winding Refn well think by turning "Walhalla Rising"?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) having no that an eye is taken; he frees itself from his hangman and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries in turn. It seems ideal for the young masculine audience in search of a bloody action, just because our hero uses violent methods of assassination. When he is moody, he tears off the intestines of his enemies without waiting that these die.
On the other hand, till the end of the film, the one-eyed man says no word about his true name. Even other characters let get away, at most, in the course of one or two sentences some terrible shouting of death throes.
Otherwise, nothing is said and they feast in the terrifically nice hilly landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decor of the world of the Vikings, about thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more the mature film-makers having an interest as existentialism and as very good trackings.
When a film aims at several target groups, it's a pity that these exclude mutually.
The film director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," its trilogy relating to the drugs dealer shy and full of style, as a kind of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more prevailing informed mood or to introduce a little less brutality in the cinema showing art films.
Most sympathizers of the cinema of art have to feel horror facing the brain which spreads all around and in intestines.
The amateurs of action films die from trouble, when the one-eyed man boards, for reasons which it is freely possible to interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship for Jerusalem; they are drowned during eternity by peace and fog before the crew arrives in America and continues being silent.
It is not then amazing that "Walhalla Rising" finds no film distributor in Germany and that it exists only under format DVD.
It is especially because of splendid pictures of the misery which deserved some attention, but also because the picture of a palpitating film, every so often, hides behind a haughty and bloody appearance.
It is about dialogues in this film, nor about a consistent action, everything is ambience, a feverish dream was transformed into film.
The spectator cannot avoid it.
Refn grants him barely an instant of relaxation and cuts him slowly the throat with glacial pictures and a gloomy soundtrack, but especially with an intangible hate which flows of the heart of the characters.
Alone a young blonde boy, who is truthfully held beside the one-eyed man, preserve some innocence, all the others is enlivened by anger.
More than everything, the one-eyed hero to whom motives are never known, but who comes back from Hell any time to fight enemies and provisionally allies transformed into warrior, is perhaps in envoy of the very devil.
He represents deterioration, but perhaps also, only for those who are, of a very way, rottenness.
"Walhalla Rising" is a cryptic film which it is possible to detest or to admire, for purpose with irritation, with enthusiasm and with astonishment.
A traumatisante experience.
Mysterious jobs of earthwork
The international agency of nuclear energy (AIEA) has new indications concerning a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take position on this subject, even less to submit to the controls of the agency.
At night from 5 till 6 September 2007 towards midnight, at least four Israeli fighters frs 15 I attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building on the Syrian territory.
He is on the bank of the Euphrates; the biggest city located nearby is in 30 kilometres: it is Dair ace on.
Its name appears in the documents of AIEA, because it is a matter of the reactor which Syria constructed it appears with the help of North Korea in stony parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing of the intelligence services of the United States, the CIA, dating from the end of April, 2008, the common reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, the el-Kibar, would be very capable to produce some plutonium, who would allow to fabricate atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technology is valid for 1950s.
The CIA showed a video of presentation including pictures satellites vague.
Across computer-aided animation, she pointed out the probable site of every component of the reactor before the destruction of the power station which represents a copy in miniature of the North Korean model of the nuclear power station of Yongbyon.
On top of that, she introduced photos showing the building located nearby, or even the inside of this one.
It seems that the reactor was on the point to be put in operation, but he was not equipped with bars of fuels yet.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombing, they have barely more information than at that time and even, with time mystery thickens more and more.
The former president of the United States George W. Bush has recently revealed in his memo that before this attack, the CIA was certainly sure that Syria had constructed a reactor to be el-Kibar, but disposed of few indications showing this country developed "an active programme of nuclear weaponry."
Some agents of information in Europe prefer being more careful on this subject and speak only about one "supposed reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA as "credible."
They lack tangible proof, as well as in AIEA.
Questioned about the way he is sure that he is dealing with a nuclear reactor, a diplomat of high rank of Nations Joined gave only a laconic answer in summer by maintaining that AIEA had of "documents enough for asking questions."
Syrian indeed took away with haste the debris of the "unused military building" and undertaken a methodical levelling of the ground.
However, in June, 2008, a team of the experts of the AIEA driven by the ancient chief inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered to el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by the men.
Besides, AIEA accepted thanks to a Member state of the pictures of satellites of the commercial contractors showing the instant which followed the attack directly. it seems that these last are more eloquent than those introduced by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous limited partner, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
He is of this impossible fact for AIEA to establish their authenticity evenly.
Syria always assured that it had never accomplished a secret atomic programme and that it had not constructed reactor.
Damascus supports that the uranium found on the site comes from weapon used by Israel.
But AIEA challenged this argument after the analysis of particles by qualifying it as improbable.
Since then, rammed refuse any debate in this respect, just as about the pictures of satellite.
On top of that, Syria does not allow to the inspectors to perform a second examination on the site of el-Kibar and refusal the access to the debris of the building destroys by the bomb.
But, same Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime minister fulfilling the duties at the time of the attack, has recently declared: "We will never make comments on this subject."
That's how the inquiry relating to this affair trails along in length since June, 2008 without their reaching a result and without that it "is transformed more and more into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as admits it a Western diplomat of high rank in service in the office of AIEA in Vienna, finally it is about a serious violation of the treaty of ban of nuclear weapons.
AIEA considers that to make progress, it is necessary to clarify the existence of three other installations which have to have " a functional report " with supposed reactor.
Until now, the inspectors neither pointed out what installations it is here, nor which is their function or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper " Süddeutsche Zeitung ," they are known within AIEA respectively under the names of Marj ace-sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also of the name of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute Institute for Science and International Security (international institute of sciences and of international security) from Washington identified these localities and overdraft on pictures of satellites a complex near Masyaf which would be very probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is possible that he is in a military base or directly next to this one; it is exactly the reason for which Syria refuses the access of three sites the inspectors of the AIEA.
In Vienna, they maintain that the Syrians fear that the group of examination is in fact spies who would be sent in the name of the United States by AIEA to spy on military installations.
To tell the truth, it is an information given by the American secret agents who attracted the attention of the nuclear inspectors.
AIEA has information, including photos satellites, pointing out that vehicles made shuttles between three sites and stony parallelepiped to transport substances.
A Western diplomat of high rank declared in Vienna that at least one of the installations could "be of use for the production of the fuel."
He "would not have indications concerning sensitive activities," such as enrichment and reprocessing of the uranium; processes which are necessary to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor indeed works thanks to the not enriched uranium.
Nevertheless, it exists in the rigour of the credible hypotheses concerning following fundamental questions: where from should have come the uranium and where as it would have later been separated the plutonium necessary for the manufacture of the bomb.
They are unaware if rubbles, which could hide considerable traces, were stocked in three sites.
When the hundreds of lorries charged with earth will have disappeared, nobody will have information on the place of stocking of rubbles.
For AIEA, it, is unlikely that Syria makes examine in 1998 the salt mine of al-Tibni, located only in some kilometres of el-Kibar, on the other side of the Euphrates, to see if he can be suitable for the stocking of radioactive waste.
By analysing recently photos taken by satellite as for the famous magazine Jane' s Intelligence Review, the ancient inspector of the AIEA, Mr Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Photos taken by satellite show however that Syria undertook jobs of earthwork in three suspicious sites and moved huge containers when AIEA begun demanding the access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but it did not contribute to dispel suspicion.
There he tells himself in diplomatic circles that AIEA spent several months to draw up a plan concerning examination to be performed there. This plan had to allow in Syria to preserve possible military secrets. Alone the invested time shows which big interest the inspectors take in this affair.
Meanwhile, Damascus also treated with disdain of this proposal.
One year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna the destruction of the reactor had not mentioned, emergency would not be signalled for this affair, asserts, for example, Glyn Davies, the ambassador of the United States who recalls for some months what is known under the name special examination, one of the most powerful means which the atomic Agency has to implement its controls.
The manager of the AIEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to offer this examination, certainly already spoke of '"an option to which I am opened in future," but he still hesitates.
This means includes a huge risk: on one hand, he requires a majority in the Council of the governors of AIEA and a good many of 35 countries which are represented do not feel like there seeing situation knowing an escalation.
on the other hand, as this diplomat who gives to réflechir: "In it he would serve, if at the end they find nothing"
Love in times of war
This goes badly since Angelina Jolie made her debut in summer as film director.
She wrote scenario herself: it is a love story between a woman native to Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing about this history is furthermore known, but it is enough for causing the feeling of faintness.
One persistent rumour points out that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love her Serbian hangman during the war of Yugoslavia.
The federations of the Bosnian women immediately protested. In answer, some sequences of filming envisaged in Sarajevo were moved in last minute in Hungary.
Meantime, the film is made in Hungary, but in the stage of post production, protests continue always in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organisation of the women war victims addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie by the intervention of the Post of high commissioner of the United Nations for the refugees (HCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Pretty is herself ambassador of goodwill of HCR.
She is not diplomat. Some weeks ago already, she offered to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but these declined this offer.
"Meeting must be held in Bosnia," asserts Hasecic.
There were not love stories in concentration camps, and scenario of Pretty says a lot there enough on its attitude towards the victims.
Guardian brings back that the organisation of Hasecic recommended, later, to the post of high commissioner of the United Nations to withdraw ambassador's quality of goodwill to Angelina Jolie.
But, in fact, what kind of scenario Pretty did she write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which accepted copies of its scenario, gave after some hesitancy a permission of filming in Sarajevo, but they do not know why then did not come in spite of this permission.
Young author assures herself that she does not pursue political aims with her film, that while making a lot of efforts she put on up to date on Yugoslavian conflict. She supports that she wants to head with terrible consequences of war and to give possibility to all parts absorbing to express himself.
She remains however vague about contents.
That's how a second synopsis of the film circulates on the net. He differs enough: The lovers knew each other long before the beginning of war. He meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported in the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as security guard.
What constitutes however a big difference with version "a victim of rape becomes infatuated with her hangman."
That the film of Pretty begins long before war, of course.
The pressure which practises on her, so expresses itself Pretty, is "unfair and founded on erronnées information."
From now on, only the fanatics of Hollywood can give him peace: By putting this scenario illegally in the net, as many others before.
Let us draw us!

The experts of the Research institute economic and social point out that 100,000 Irishmen will leave their country shortly.
They envisage even a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
What represents a huge loss for a small country of 4,5 million inhabitants.
If these predictions come true, it will be a current of emigration comparable to the one from which Ireland suffered in 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in the course of which the Irishmen have enjoy a big ease, grief takes all place from now on.
Economic crisis touches however especially the young Irishmen, formed well, who knew until now only instants of happiness.
Loss of job and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everybody had a job, there is some money in excess.
But, meantime, three persons of ten of less than thirty years are unemployed.
The newspaper Irish Times publishes copiously the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything drifts away."
"There should be an uprising against the politicians and the bankers, but the one who has possibilities of it, leaves and our country so the whole generation."
"The last to be left switched off the light."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the labour union of the Irish students, sees clocking in a darker future because the government is only throwing some powder to eyes and gives no perspective of future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," declares the young 20-year-old student.
She sees her friends how block release not paid to other one holds on tightly of one.
She declares that worries are his biggest herself in four years is to emigrate.
"It is a sad and discouraging thought."
However the men as STEPHEN MCLARNON to try to approach this topic positively.
MCLARNON organises the living room " WorkingAbroadExpo " which gives a support integral on topic "to work on foreigner."
"But the job abroad constitutes for the new in profession an extraordinary occasion to make the first steps in the echelons of professional hierarchy," asserts the representative.
Its site web shows the photos of the surfers in Australia and surfers of snows in the canada.
The message is clear: To work on foreigner is not a galley, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For six months, Seán O' Donovan, knows what means be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing more to make in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he works Germany from now on with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector e.
A home of mode just goes out from earth to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue working on other plans Hannovre or Berlin.
Meantime, to Hear Donovan seldom visits his country only native, because it participates in an additional workstation, to be able to finish reimbursing credit contracted to build his house in the native land.
"Situation is already a bit crazy," he asserts by crossing the threshold of his home for the first time after long time.
"I make money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I did not live practically any more."
It bursts of an abashed laugh by crossing cold rooms.
The small home is in a residential zone with front gardens well treated, expensive cars of big marks are parked on paths.
Four years ago, to Hear Donovan bought the house together with his sister for a 380,000-euro sum, financed in 100 pourcent by credit.
"These were instants of madness, unquestionably, the money was easy," he asserts.
Is he afraid to see very collapsing because of credit?
To hear Donovan thinks one instant, serves again some hot tea and declares: "I do not have children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes of foible, I can leave again in zero."
The engineer of the building does not like the wailings which he often hears recently.
"Nobody must suffer from hunger, our situation is not nevertheless as dramatic as what was lived in the past here on the island," he supports.
"To work for a moment abroad, it is not what can go without worse, perhaps it is what makes that we first feel Irishman.
He laughs and speaks then about his father who went to England during the last big economic crisis.
"He was back having crossed seven years there and, in Ireland, life went on, simply."
This idea likes in Cian Tanner.
To leave the future and to discover how life takes place elsewhere.
In his honours list, He counts already some working years in London. It is the reason for which life should not be also easy in New Zealand for him and for his girlfriend.
But there is another thing which really worries him these last days: holiday to be organised on the occasion of its 27th birthday in Dublin.
He fears that she could not be transformed in party of goodbye.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he says by drinking a long sip of beer.
"A goodbye, this seems however worrying."
"Let us call this rather one party of goodbye, very slackened, uniting some friends, with some drinks and some games."
Democratic routine
The support of democracy in Latin America continues augmenting, just as that to the private firm.
Crime became one more great concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in a lot of the region.
It are sure of conclusions of the last opinion poll Latinobarómetro taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist there.
Given that opinion poll was accomplished in a regular way since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two linked elements come out again from results of the opinion poll of this year, performed in September and at the beginning of October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
Second is increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
The support of democracy augmented appreciably in several countries on the perimetre of the Pacific of South America (see picture 1).
For example in Peru, where economic growth attained 6% on average a year since 2002, the support of democracy passed of a 40% minimum in 2005 to 61% this year.
He also augmented in Mexico, where economy stood up having suffered a strong fall of production last year.
But only about the half of the guarantors in Mexico and in Brazil, both countries most populated with the region, persuaded democrats are, what brings down regional average (see picture 2).
About 44% guarantors of the region declared themselves satisfied of the way the democracy of their country worked in practice; it is about the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on 25% in 2001 (graph 3)
About 34% said that they trusted the Parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same that last year in both cases; but sharply up in comparison with 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support of democracy.
If it held out during worldwide financial crisis, it is indeed due to the fact that of many of country of America suffered only a short recession and benefited from a strong resumption.
Besides, a net of social security contributed to protect the poor people.
(The economic Committee of the United Nations for Latin America brought back this week that the proportion of the Latin Americans living in poverty augmented only slightly in 2009 and this year, in 32% once again went down.)
But mood varies (cf. graph 4) considerably from a country to the other one.
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is translated by a feeling widely shared by progress
What is rarer in Mexico and in Central America where recession was more strict and where violent crimes deteriorated.
It is only for the second time since opinion poll began that more guarantors across Latin America as a whole named crime rather than unemployment as being the problem the most important for their country (see picture 5).
About 31% say that themselves or one of their close were victim of a criminal act in the course of the past year; nevertheless, this figure is going down in comparison with 38% the last year and are the lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support of private firm and free market: about 71% guarantors of the region say that the private firm is necessary for development, against 56% in 2007 (cf. graph 6).
About 58% think that free market is the only system which will return their developed country, against 47% last year.
Interesting fact, 62% guarantors in Venezuela is of this opinion (and 80% support the private firm); even if their president of left, Hugo Chavez, puts a compulsory purchase order on many private firms.
Brazil is the biggest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% persons questioned (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged in comparison with last year) and Venezuela (9%, in fall of 11% for last year)
But the United States are considered as the most influential country by the guarantors in Mexico and in the biggest part of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this differentiation in Ecuador, in Dominican Republic and in Nicaragua.
A vote made dirty
Nobody expected to have general election improved in Haiti on November 28th.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country stricken and plunged into fear.
Ballot boxes and new polls, ballots dispersed in goutières, vandalized polling stations and threats were introduced
Polling stations opened late in the evening.
A lot Hatïens, including many who was moved further to the January seism, wandered in neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up leaving.
A dozen of candidates for the presidential election, fraud of which several supposed favourites, reported and claimed the cancellation of election.
Protests, sometimes violent, blew up across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmund Mulet, the senior civil servant in Haiti of the Organisation of the United Nations, considers event to be "a rather good election in many respects."
Observers of the Organisation of the American States and the Community of the Caribbean declared carefully that they "did not think that these irregularities so serious are, had necessarily invalidated process."
In other words, show goes on.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Prevalley, unpopular outgoing president, and in his candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on December 7th.
Second waited turn is envisaged for January.
Any hope in election is not lost.
Both candidates of opposition, Michel Martelly, musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, an ancient first lady, left their initial call so that vote is declared void.
But there can be problems if Mr Célestin, not much or with no observable support at the voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having achieved backs it up toura attains the second turn.
With an epidemic of cholera which rages, and more than 1 million survivors in the seism who still live in tents, they feared that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitïens wanted to vote but was prevented from making it because of disorganisation.
About 250 000 identity cards, necessary to vote, were not distributed shortly before election yet.
Stake is important.
The donors see the election of a government popular and legitimate as an important stage in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it is clear, the Haitian make it them - even.
La pointe des pieds vers le centre
Weeks having become suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, benefited from a wave of sympathy of the public who improved his rate of approval of 20 points, in more than 50%; it is about its highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, to transform it into a campaign achieved for a second term during an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which she would leave or not the intransigence of her late husband, precursor and ancient political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
Et, à ce propos, les signes restent confus.
Mr Kirchner, who continued managing the economic policy, even after his wife succeeds it as president, had habit to work out budgets which underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
It allowed to the first couple to spend at pleasure additional incomes.
The government of Mrs Fernández lost its majority to the Congress last year, on paper.
But opposition is divided, and situation sank into distress continuation on the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some of the members dissidents of Peronist movement in power joined Mrs Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian hit to the face one of his peers and where others accused the government of corruption), the Congress has not to approve the budget 2011.
"I am not going to argue," declared the president.
Currently, the budget 2010 will be applied next year, leaving to the president another bigger room for manoeuvre to spend at pleasure.
Economy overheats widely: it is likely to grow of about 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is now in 11,1% but many private estimates and the wage claims of labour unions, see this figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took up his posts in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority of growth and of reduction of poverty, rather than of control of the inflation.
He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private and purged sector INDEC, the statistical office, who undertook falsifications of statistics on the official inflation.
Can Mrs Fernández currently soften this policies?
She called to talks between private firms and union leaders.
And his civil servants say that they want to limit the increase of wage next year to 18%.
Economy was stimulated by high worldwide prices of agricultural export of Argentina.
But the inflation eroded the nudge in the right direction in growth further to a strong devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps reason for who Mrs Fernández show signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina towards the rest of the world.
This year, the government entered into an agreement with the bondholders who had refused a previous restructuring forced by the debt for which Argentina had not regulated its expiry dates in 2001.
Maintenant Mme Fernández semble s'approcher vers un accord avec les gouvernements de créancier groupés dans le Club de Paris, auquel il doit environ $6,7 milliards.
Kirchner always stressed the fact that it could not implicate a surveillance by the IMF, as he is of custom.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would give a "technical aid" to conceive a new national indication of prices in consumption; what resembles one is a prelude of the cleaning up of INDEC.
He is not clear if Mrs Fernández wants to stay in policy beyond the end of her mandate, supporting that her husband is not any more in her sides.
If she makes it, she needs to earn the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is very advocated.
When the Argentinians will be taken in their summer holidays in march, the wave of sympathy for her will have flowed back.
If she wants to earn another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, quietly, many policies of her husband.
A half cheer for China
The Taiwanese voters are if orientated towards a kind of a narrower union with the continent.
Of what Taiwan thinks of its elder brother located on the other side of the détroit?
More than 7,5 million voters came on November 27th, that is 70% acceptable persons, to elect the mayors and town councillors in five urban regions, as part of what is considered to be a general valuation of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr My became a substitute for feelings in comparison with the continent himself, having tied the innovative links of business, including a pact of free exchange partial, in the biggest reorganisation of relations with China as such since 1949.
Mr My successful the test, but hardly.
Although its Kuomintang (KMT) party wins three of five city councils, he failed to win the majority of voices.
Instead of it, the democratic-progressive Party (DPP), which leant towards the complete independence of Taiwan, won about 50% of all polls for KMT of 45%.
If it had been presidential polls, Mr My would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the part of vote of its party fell about 8%.
For the first time, DPP attracted voters, even with KMT in town councils.
Event revealed Taiwanese elections most main subjects of, including of lorries with rowdy campaign and flags of gathering of mass with girls who danced in minimal keeping.
A try of compulsory mysterious assassination was also perpetrated.
Sean Lien, son of Link Chan, honorary president of the KMT, accomplished an electoral tour for a candidate of the KMT on the eve of election.
A man of the crowd pulled on young Mr Lien, purely across the face, invidious and killing a passer-by.
Strangely, he was not determined if the shooter wanted to harm Mr Lien or to regulate a disagreement with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, murder had consequences to election by running distrust on DPP and by turning the voters to KMT.
Perhaps that the biggest winning of elections China was.
It was striking to determine how much the question of the continental part was away itself.
Instead of it, the candidates jousted with plans for the public accommodation and the job creation.
Taiwan enjoys its de facto independence habitually and detests the military threat of China.
So, KMT has tendency to avoid strutting about its links with the government of Beijing.
But this time, DPP also refrained from stirring anti-Chinese feeling.
It is the answer to a retake of conscience according to which the Chinese firms are necessary to the economic survival of Taiwan.
Mr My, from his part, demanded a confirmation to know if his policy relating to China was allowable for the Taiwanese majority.
It is possible to expect that the government of Beijing continues giving with commercial opportunities, in accordance with its strategy which aims at deluding Taiwan, back in the bercail.
China did not waste time for sending a negotiator to Taipei to organise a summit on protection of investments and medical cooperation.
Certainly, she would also like to see a political integration; but let us begin with the beginning.
It is better to wait for it after the presidential election of 2012.
DPP reinvented in any case.
Two years ago, he went badly: his ancient leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent in prison further to accusations of corruption.
President from 2000 till 2008, he was a provocateur in favour of an explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates came into the world conducted by Mrs Tsai and PDP implements everything to attract the professionals and the young people.
Mrs Tsai was greeted as a candidate of the DPP for the presidency, as Su Tseng-chang, which served under Mr Chen.
Their party is making as best as he can to show that he also can get involved with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans intended for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their discussions could have unquestioning place prior.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party introduces a "trustworthy alternative" in comparison with the approach thrown by Mr My about China.
Mr Chen seems exasperated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he declared that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained better results if they had stressed the fact that Taiwan is a distinct country.
He even ordered Mr Been able, a pragmatic, not to set his sights on the presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr Chen, DPP will find it difficult to choose between his potential candidates.
KMT has to make an introspection on his/her own.
Valuation of Mr My was weak; in spite of a dizzy economic growth, the candidates of the KMT did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be owed to a great extent to unemployment and to widening of the ditch between rich men and poor people.
A spokesperson of the KMT says that his office as well as his local branches will be altered.
The good results of PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwaneses see economic integration with Patterned as unavoidable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a distinguished leader writer, "the point of not return already passed."
Nominations to Grammy Awards: the singer of jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise chosen in the category " better new artist"
To perform at the request of a president, and people are required to acquaint themselves with it.
Esperanza Spalding, bass player of jazz and 26-year-old hand-picked singer by the president Obama to occur during its ceremony of the Nobel prize of Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of Grammy Awards this year with a large-scale nomination in the category of " the best new artist ."
Considering that Spalding is a face very known on the stage of the jazz since its album of 2008, " Esperanza ," nomination remains a bit mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of Grammy Awards according to whom an artist must take out no more than three albums before recording; what "establishes the public identity of this artist."
Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," indeed marked a step forward and, given its slightly engaging vocal style, the clever hand of pop and of funk and its Latin influence, it is possible to draw at least a line stippled in Spalding in comparison with the dazzling success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the voters of Grammy Awards by taking into account productions of jazz in this category these last years.
Elsewhere, the voters of Grammy Awards rightly honoured "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the category " instrumental album ," one transferred on a tonic shiver of a recording which was one of the primordial favourites the last year.
Among this Iyer, "Moody 4B" of the saxophonist veteran James Moody and "Positootly" of the claviériste John Beasley will notably be in competition.
Paper clip Shorty, favourite in the husky voice of New Orleans and invited frequent in "Treme" of HBO, was honoured in the category of jazz contemporary; who bows moreover strongly towards certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, JOHN MCLAUGHLIN and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiarised with the steampunk, earned some recognition deserved well in the category big group; in competition with rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose album " Pathways " of its byte s live was a nice example of the democratic hand of this bass player as leader of group.
Nomination of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards annual include a mixture of landscapes of musicians and of compositors of the whole world.
At the head of nominations, let us name "Deus ex machina " of Michael Daugherty, for the piano and the orchestra, with five " yes "; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three " yes ."
Among the nominating having links with the California of the South, there is the Estonian compositor Arvo Pärt as the Symphony n°4, "Los Angeles," a work which was ordered by the philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles and that opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Madolin Concerto of the compositor based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in lists for a reward.
Classical nominations are divided on 13 categories covering recording of orchestra, of opera, of chorale and solo.
A category for the classical producer of the year turns the spotlight on five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classical album are Symphonies n °3 and 4 Bruckner of the royal Orchestra of Concertgebouw; "deus ex machina " and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty du Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey du Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of Castrati" turning the spotlight on various artists; and the "Requiem" of Turning green of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the opera, the nominating are "Lulu" de Berg of the Orchestra of Royal House opera, "Mark Antonio e Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse du Ars Lyrica Houston; "Love from a distance" from Kaija Saariaho of Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chorus of the Theatre Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoé" of National Arthur Sullivan of BBC Orchestrated Wales of.
The compositors who are in position for Grammy Awards for contemporary composition count Pärt for the Symphony n°4, Daugherty for "Deus ex machina ," grunts Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted."
The Symphony n°4 from Pärt had its first one to the Disney Hall in January, 2009 in an execution recorded by the philharmonic Orchestra of Los Angeles, run by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and devoted to the ex-magnate of the oil Mikhaïl Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
"Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was nominated for its instrumental benefit soloist with an orchestra.
The compositor of Los Angeles said that he aviat writes the work of 15 minutes especially for the interpreter in the mandolin Avi Avital, which played the concerto with Metropolis Ensemble, assembling in New York.
"I wrote it by using sounds of the Middle East and big number of ranges and of rhythms of North Africa," declared Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85 years old, accepted a nomination in the category of the benefits of orchestra, to have run the symphonic Orchestra of Chicago in a recording of the writings of Stravinsky.
Among the instrumental soloists who accepted a nomination, let us name the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.

In the category of classical miscellany, the soprano Jessye Norman accepted a nomination for her recording "Racines: my life, my song"
The plan of the mosque of Temecula wins the approval of the committee of planning.
A plan of mosque in Temecula accepted the unanimous support of the committee of local planning after more than five hours of evidence public, often enthralled.
Critics were taken in plan by pretending that it made promotion so much terrorism as traffic jams of traffic.
But the commissioners gave a ruling on Wednesday evening when the new religious centre respected local laws and when it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many people well came to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahaïs, you mention him," declared Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, speaking on Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as American citizen."
"It shows that justice takes it."
"Opposition is really trifling," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good persons in this valley."
Session began at 6 pm and lasted till almost midnight with, mostly, of people pronounced for or against the centre, at the time of word almost also split, according to Press-Enterprise.
Debate continued on the site web of the newspaper.
"There is not America anymore," wrote a dealer.
"It is about another planet of the monkeys with misses Liberty died in the sand."
"America fell."
The planned Islamic centres also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including in Ground Zero, place of the assassination attempts of September 11th, 2001, perpetrated in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush reported violence in Temecula Valley.
Its congregation in the order of 135 families co-exists without incident in the county of Riverside many years but her wanted a bigger and better space than a warehouse which it rented on a property shared with a producer of systems of filtering of water.
The new 24,943-foot mosque ensconced themselves in the architecture of Mediterranean style would be composed of two minarets and would rise as high as 43 feet.
She would occupy a 4,32 hectare site on the road Nicolas about two miles east of the high school Chaparral.
The opponents can again call the town council against this plan.
A microbe tolerating the arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use the arsenic as one of its nutritious elements, enlarges the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements which were considered to be the basics.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"She can developed either with some phosphorus, or with some arsenic."
"That is why she is very particular, even if it is far from being a form of life really "foreign," commented Paul Davies C. W. de la l' University of State of Arizona, co-author of the report representing Science in the online edition of Thursday of the newspaper.
Six major elements were considered for a long time to be the basics for life: the carbon, the hydrogen, the nitrogen, the oxygen, the phosphorus and the sulphur.
But the researchers discovered that the bacterium, discovered in the lake Monoskiing, in California, is capable of continuing developing having replaced the phosphorus with the arsenic.
"They wonder what is still possible," declared Ariel Anbar D. of the State university of Arizona, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in research of life beyond the Earth because the researchers have to be capable of admitting life, knowing what life resembles, says Anbar.
Study concentrates on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, generated speculations spread on the Internet according to which the report could disclose the discovery of an extraterrestrial life.
It was not case.
Discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be capable of using other elements to operate biochemistry and than "standard" all the elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, on professor in the Institute of planetary Scientific research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the search party.
"This job is new because it shows substitution from an element to other one in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It was not a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, who ran study, chose the lake Monoskiing because he is endowed with high levels of arsenic.
The arsenic and the phosphorus are chemically similar; so, she speculated that a microbe displayed to both substances could be capable of substituting mutually.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar in that some phosphorus."
"Consequently, organisms find it difficult to differentiate these elements separately."
"But the arsenic differs enough so that it does not work exactly as the phosphorus; it enters indoors and, in a way, erases the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar.
The researchers gathered the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and displayed it to increasing concentration of arsenic to which she could fit and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but fact that he can live with the arsenic on the place raise possibility that a form of life using the arsenic can occur naturally, is elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology to the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which the arsenic could be replaced with the phosphorus, was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could walk.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she says; so, the researchers issued hypothesis that the first forms of life would have been possible use it.
It suggests that there could be other ways of forming life, not only way the life on Earth was formed at the beginning," declared Foster, who was not part of the search party of Wolfe-Simon.
Research was financed by NASA, ministry of Energy and national Institute of health.
Two last stolen dogs of exhibition were found in Compton
Two other dogs of exhibition on four stealing outside of a motel in Bellflower were found, the sheriffs of the county of Los Angeles have it anoncé on Thursday.
Four dogs of exhibition - two akitas two and corgis pembroke Welsh - disappeared on Tuesday when somebody stole the van Chevrolet Express in which they had spent the night outside a motel 6 Bellflower, announced authorities.
Two of the dogs were recovered on Wednesday afternoon and two others were found at the end of party Wednesday, declared to Steve Whitmore, the spokesperson of the department of the sheriff of the county of Los Angeles.
"Good news, it is that the dogs go well," says Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They were restored to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore refused to say precisely where the dogs had been found, in which district and which were the circumstances of their discovery.
"An inquiry is under way."
"We do not want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to give a comment on Thursday.
They were united on Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a shelter for animals of the county located in Downey.
The assistants of the sheriff found the van and both dogs separately in Compton.
Akitas - Draw, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - was safe and sound, announced authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis whom Rickard and Peek had planned to show in regional competitions this week, as for the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing up to their discovery on Wednesday evening.
Le coup d'œil furtif et Rickard, qui vivent à Redding, sont demi-cadratin ville ce le week-end dans le cadre du championat "AKC/Eukanuba" national de la Longue Plage, où ils comptaient présenter la Trace.
One waited for the other dogs to participate in the competitions of other tests envisaged in days preceding exhibition " AKC / Eukanuba ," declared Peek in the Times on Wednesday.
The California of the South is one of the stopping of the tour of canine exhibition of almost a month of the couple.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard proved in the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van outside, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a pup to Box, a hole Parson Russell and a Breton épagneul - who stayed with them in the room of the motel.
But they left Akitas and corgis, in the more thick fur, in the van where he would be more cool.
They a bit opened windows, so that the dogs could have the fresh air.
Peek and Rickard signalled the flight of the van at 6 am Tuesday.
Peek said that they would give a reward to every person who could drive them to corgis, provided with a microflea established to identify them.
He is not clear if a reward was granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to go red once again, the restructuring of MGM does not wait more than the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and of uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start from scratch.
A federal judge of bankruptcies of New York, officially rented the plan on Thursday "prepacked" by the creditors according to which about 5 thousand million dollars of debt would be erased; opening the way to the firm of entertainment, having 86 years of existence, to concentrate its efforts on production and distribution of films and of programmes of television.
With the decision of Thursday, according to which plan meets requirements of the code of the bankruptcy of the United States, no more legal obstacle remain in front of MGM to recover in stream under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the managing directors of what will be a lightened studio.
The personnel will be brought back in about 320 of 400 at first.
MGM will not indeed appear from the Chapter 11 as long as JPMORGAN CHASE will not have concluded an easiness of 500 million dollar credit, envisaged to finance new operations and productions of MGM.
She is currently distributed under licence by the bank of investment, which collides with 75 million dollars itself, and should be financed towards mid-December.
The process of restructuring of the studio started in May, 2009 when the bank of investment Moelis and Co was hired to recommend the direction on the way of putting its finances given that it had no means to pay interests coming to 300 million dollars a year.
In August, the managing director, Harry Sloan, was replaced with Stephen Cooper, an ancient CEO of Enron and an expert in rebound known for his job at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The tries of Moelis and of Cooper to solve financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy most than 140 creditors of the studio took much more time than envisaged.
After several months of debates, parts agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the society for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders among whom none of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 thousand millions more the creditors of which were in research.
In spring of this year, it was necessary to do again everything while the team of MGM had begun working on a plan of restructuring which, after months of disagreement and internal debates, was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM goes out officially of bankruptcy in next weeks, Moelis et Cooper firms accept several million dollar bonuses for their job.
Moelis and Co., who has already got 1,2 million dollars, will accept a 9,5 million dollar payment.
The firms of Cooper, which collected 375 000 $ a month for their services of direction of the firm, will accept a "bonus of success" from 4 million dollars.
To bore stiff and Birnbaum intends to restart the production of MGM, which took out only the single film this year, and to set up an annual list of seven or eight films which would go out from 2012.
They also have the intention of co-financing two films based on Hobbit ," with Warner Bros
The studio must conclude a distinct loan between $ 265 000 000 and $ 275 millions to finance its part in these two films, which must be accomplished by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who keeps MGM about 18% debts of, tried to accomplish a fusion of the studio with Leos Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, the recent debates between both societies did not lead to an agreement.
Toys Tech to support your budget presents in balance
Although the main candidate for the most marvellous toy of this year is IPAD, followed, perhaps, by the system of video game of Microsoft, Kinect, two can make an important hole in your budget presents.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five bikes BMX from 99 $ and that a game Kinect costs the same price as 10 skipping ropes classic of pearls, or about 48 boxes of Play-Doh.
But there are ways of keeping your budget presents in balance.
Recently, I visited three national sellers of toys - Wal-Mart, Toys " R " Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys which I could buy for less than 80 $.
It is clear that the Law de Moore evolved, the technological toy of this year is likely to have more force; while costing the same price otherwise a little less, compared with last year.
Besides, while there are generally fewer new toys linked to Websites, two of the most knowing of this type, Webkinz and Penguin club, have more offer.
And toys with piles button are in increase, as well as toys with rechargeable piles.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys " R " Us, unless opposite indication.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ for 3 years and more) is plush toys of the size of a Guinea pig which sing a note when to you to be pressing to them on the belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If to buy several from you, they will sing in harmony.
Attention: once you begin supporting, you cannot stop any more.
To combine song with dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, 60 $ for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Drawing inspiration the technology of Elmo Live of last year, doll animatronique of 14 thumbs plays games alternately as Simon Says and can make lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with blockage of wheels.
The children essyaé with the toy use Mickey as instructor of dance while their parents complain about a lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the eighties, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerised educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, 40 $ for 3 years and more), with a backpack filled with cards of game questionnaire conceived to transform a joyride into a session with an auto-correction and a filing cabinet of gates.
If you are distrustful when your child holds your smartphone, here is three autonomous alternatives.
The Mobigo de VTech (60 $, for 3 - 8 years) is the least expensive and the easiest to use, with a keyboard qwerty, although games do not educate as efficiently as Explorer Leapster (70 $, for 3 - 12 years), it is about the first big revision of the range Leapster, with a more luminous and more recent screen.
No version is compatible with the ancient cartridges.
The iXL of Fisher-Price (90 $, for 3 - 7 years) uses a system of type iTunes to give games and electronic books and is endowed with an entrance for card SD which allows to show photos of family.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is all five blocks barely bigger than a box of match, each having its own screen LED.
Objective is to form words by putting the online blocks before the time passes, it is ideal for an impromptu spelling bee.
More and more, toys have a kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in the shops of toys, bigger two are Webkinz and Penguin club.
To buy from your child an online pet of the Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix 'N Match Face Pack, 5 $, for 6 - 12 years) which understands a room marked with a hidden code.
When to buy to you back the line code, your child accepts enough credits to the shop Club Penguin for two articles in choices.
It can be about roller skates or about a pet toy Puffle.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($ 10, for 5 years and more) is last micro-robots with pile button.
The wrong animal moves fast on 12 vibrating pasta in silicone in unpredictable directions.
It is amusing to make a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way across.
She is also solid.
Ours resisted a fall of the table of the kitchen and even a momentary passage in the face of our dog.
Bring a softer side in the maintaining of order in China
Tang Shenbin surveyed a place of the city as an urban sergeant in training by surveying severely the nervous expenses, by issuing in low voice of orders with a military authority.
He wanted that the female members of chengguan - imposing representatives for public order in China, feared and despised for their arbitrary suppression and their tendency for violence - transmit some impression to group of audience.
"Be straight held!"
"Be sharp!"
Show them, he says, "what resemble the pretty girls!"
Four girls having barely crossed white adolescence in gloves, dressed in jackets and in identical trousers of olive colour, froze in standing to attention.
Four pairs of black shoes with heel, lined up with a ruler.
Four well-manicured hats perfectly stuck at the top of hair tied by a knot scratched in blue and white.
"Personally, I think that they have a medium appearance," said Mr Tang, scornfully.
"Models are pretty."
More than a government tried to cool the picture of the urban inspectors of China.
A city demanded that all new recruits have a certificate of the upper study.
The province of Guangdong exchanged the grey-green of uniforms for a more engaging so-called blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced baisser-les-yeux with the strong-arm tactics:: in 2009, a report signalled that 50 officers had encircled a wagon to uncontrollable snack bar by throwing black looks, firmly during half an hour, until the pedlar packs up again his business and leaves.
Xindu, an urban region of 680 000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to make a big operation of picture.
Since 2003, the region supplemented its street police in towns of 13 women, especially chosen to be their appearance, their curve and their youth.
Idea is to give to the rough-hewed police a softer, more female side.
Unfortunately, same Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to attract look to this underground urban brigade of China
And with good reason, critics will say.
Contrary to the police, these agents are allowed only to make respect local prescriptions by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media represents news of a different reality.
In January, 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat an observer in death after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste.
Last year, a textbook of training for the inspectors of Beijing, concealed and put online, described how to conquer the delinquents efficiently without issuing blood.
This year in Shanghai, a pedlar of watermelons was left with a cerebral lesion after a fight with five officers.
A video game impregnated with violence, available by online downloading, shows Chinese inspectors formed in the attack of the street sellers.
"Chengguan marked the government," deplored last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth debate on tactics.
The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning."
The sceptics say that approach is really far there.
After the region placed an advertisement in October to find eight new female recruits, a leader, appeared in The Beijing Evening News, wondered if the women had reals tasks or if they were only a tourist entertainment.
Answer seems to be a bit of two.
The announcement of the region demanded female, old candidates between 18 to 22 years, to have a nice silhouette and "five features of the face in good order."
They have to have the upper size in average, that is of 1,6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ thumbs.
The retirement in 26 years is compulsory.
The officers declared that job was physically too hard for the women of more than 25 years.
"It is their picture which is important," said some officer of region to Rednet.com, Website almost governmental.
"Firstly, the external qualities of the candidates will determine if they suit; it is about size, about weight, about features of the face, etc"
Then come temperament and "internal qualities."
The women of Chengguan are as vases with flowers, he said, adding: "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy manager of the office of management of the region of the city, does not adhere to this description.
But he noted that requirements concerning the height were standard norm in many Chinese offer of job for both sexes.
Such is the case of the exigeance relating to the order of features of the face.
That it means nice is a subject of debate among the Chineses.
Certainly, the persons handicapped or disfigured have not to postulate.
"We cannot leave a person who limps or a hunchbacked to come to serve here," says Mr Zheng.
"He would not give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who is on patrol on the place Baoguang near a monastery, is old of 22 and has pommelées cheeks with a mouth finely bent.
She does not consider the emphasising of her appearance as being sexist, at-elle said.
"Do you think that I have sexy air in this uniform? "she asked for a disillusioned air.
Xu Yang, his colleague in dimples 21-year-old, says: "Our job is to introduce the picture of the city."
They do not oppose to the fact that their mandate is limited, they said, because they feed bigger ambition of career than to dispel the sellers simply in the alleyways where they are supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team confronts a dozen of street vendors who move fast in foot or in bike, by trying to sell the most possible of buns or of bowls of tofu before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We have already said it to you several times!," said Mrs Xu while a seller runs away on foot, leaving provisionally his bike-cart with noodles.
The agents describe their functions rather as monotonous than arduous.
"It is almost the same thing every day," declared Huang Jing, 20-year-old, who studies marketing after job.
"Big routine."
One of the reasons is that the female agents have no power of their masculine counterparts to confiscate the property of the sellers.
They can only threaten to signal the offenders to their masculine superiors.
It tends to protect them from exhibitions publics sudden of animosity against bureaucracy which are common in all China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, rebelled after the spread of wrong rumours according to whom the agents of the chengguan had killed a seller.
In night, more than a dozen of policemen and agents of the chengguan was hurt, 14 vehicles of the government were overturned or put in fire.
Xindu avoided until now such violence.
But peace is hardly guaranteed.
Just two patties of houses of placid place Baoguang, where the officers of female were on patrol this morning, more than 50 persons gathered on the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorbike which was being repaired on the pavement rather than in a shop, as regulation imposes it on them.
The owner of the motorbike shouted in scandal.
An arm wrestling of 15 minutes followed before the policemen, with the sinister face, elbow in in jogs towards their vehicle and rush away with the motorbike and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years, a co-ordinator tied to the masculine team, stayed behind, the white badge turned to hide the name.
As the officers of female, the co-ordinators - men of 40 or more years old - play purely a role of support.
Contrary to them, they are not formed with a view to supporting an oilskin picture.
"Sometimes, we fight orally."
"Sometimes, we fight physically," says Mr Li said of a neutral tone.
"Mostly, it is the public who begins."
The prosecutors will not indict the senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice raised the criminal accusations carried on the senator John Ensign, following from an affair linked to a helper of an ancient campaign and to his efforts to get a job of lobbying for the husband of the woman, have anoncé on Wednesday the lawyers of the senator.
Decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat confronted by Mr Ensign, the republican of the Nevada who was considered to be a possible republican candidate for the presidential election of 2012 until the scandal around its affair makes the national headlines the last year and harm its career.
The office of Mr Ensign declared that he was "very happy" by decision, result of an inquiry of one year.
The senator could again be displayed to disciplinary measures taken by the senatorial committee of ethics.
The lawyers of Mr Ensign declared that the Ministry of Justice "had informed that the senator Ensign made no more object of the inquiry and that he had no intention of supporting of any accusation against him in this affair."
The Ministry of Justice refrained from comment on this subject.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise for many external lawyers of ethics to the Ministry of Justice, according to whom there would be significant proof pointing out that Mr Ensign would have conspired to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first announced in October, 2009 in New York Times, pointed out that Mr Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of her helpers, to get a job of profitable lobbying to earn the silence of Mr Hampton and of his wife, Cynthia, regarding the affair of the senator with her.
Mrs Hampton once served as treasurer during a campaign of Ensign.
Mr Ensign contacted some political backers to find job for Mr Hampton and, then, he defended their rights after they hired Mr Hampton to make lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and with interviews.
Given that Mr Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr Ensign, it was forbidden him for one year by law to make lobbying to his ancient employer or to the Senate as a whole.
The experts in ethics supported that the unusual agreement between Mr Ensign and Mr Hampton, who were close friends before affair, seems in contradiction with the ban said about the swivel door of lobbying.
According to the proof which became public, "there seems to be a proof prevailed facie of a conspiracy with a view to violating and substantial violation of the law of the swivel door," declared Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington who specialises in the defence of clients of an inquiry by the government.
Although the judge of the ministry refuses to explain the reasoning having driven to decision in affair Ensign, Mr Brand and other lawyers in ethics said that the ministry seemed to be wary of political chases after some cashed backs of high level by its section of public integrity, including decision appraises last year to leave chases against the ancient senator Ted Stevens accused of error of chase.
The federal prosecutors are apparently afraid to take weapon, declared Melanie Sloan, the general head of the citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington, a group of defence which accepted several complaints against Mr Ensign in affair.
"Cela dit fondamentalement que les fonctionnaires se classant haut peuvent supposer maintenant que les lois ne s'appliquent pas à eux," a-t-elle ajouté.
Paul Coggins, main lawyer of Mr Ensign, declared in an interview that he had accepted on Mondays a phone call on behalf of a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a monitoring the following day, saying to it that the ministry did not search accusations against its client.
The team of lawyers of Mr Ensign had collaborated with the prosecutors to try to persuade them that the senator, such as his office reasserted him on Wednesday in a press release, "had acted in accordance with law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify legal arguments that he had made to the Office of Public Prosecutor.
"I am not comfortable to go into detail of my debates with the Ministry of Justice, safe to say that we think that they made good decision," said at-il.
Last month, the federal Committee of Elections decided to leave an inquiry further to an independent complaint by the group of ethics, supporting that the 96.000 $ payment by the parents of Mr Ensign in Hampton violated the federal Elections Act.
The electoral committee declared that it did not have enough proof to prove that the money was very safe a present.
NV ENERGY, an important society of the Nevada which has supported the senator for a long time, is a firm for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hampton to find the job of lobbying.
An e-mail sent in December, 2008 showed that, after the firm welcomed Mr Hampton as lobbyst, the principal private secretary of Mr Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr Hampton and said to him that he "beat" the ministry of the Interior on a question in litigation.
Mr Ensign also participated in a lunch with Mr Hampton and another client of the Nevada, Allegiant Air, and he asked the secretary of the transport to fix a meeting in the name of the airline having urged Mr Hampton to make lobbying.
When news of affair surfaced the last year, Mr Ensign apologised to his voters and resigned from his leader's post in the fourth republican rank to the Senate.
Having supported a low profile during several months, Mr Ensign declared two weeks ago it had the intention of craving for a third mandate to the Senate.
By announcing that Mr Ensign was not any more the target of a criminal inquiry, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, declared that the senator hoped that the committee of ethics would follow fast the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to its inquiry.
The senator Ensign is delighted to follow his job persevered in the name of the people of the Nevada, she says.
L'appel de Cheshire pointera vers le Gazouillement
A half a dozen of them were knocking in the distance in the rows of the room of audience.
They sent all minutes of the reports of horrible stories via Twitter.
At the end, defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the trial of the affair of rape and the children tied to their bed in a home which was burnt down.
On Thursday, the trial widely followed by Steven J. The Hagues, who was admitted culprit of the murder of three members of the family Cheshire, in Connecticut, should result in the official end when the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by jury.
But the lawyers of Mr Hayes already have deposit elements in the court which sketch arguments of call, likely to occupy courts during years.
What is provocative, it is that the intense reports on trial - as well as use generalised and spread by the journalists of Twitter - created a "atmosphere of circus," an instantaneous and so spread saturation with incendiary details that jury was badly influenced by passions of the public.
Request could push the judges of call to be discussed on question to know if new technologies demand new rules in the rooms of audience.
"I made experience during this trial; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the rooms of audience undermines the rights of the person to an equitable trial," declared Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr Hayes, leader lawyer.
The judge of trial, Jon C. Blue of the upper State Court, laconically rejected claims in the judgement returned last week, maintaining that media "was carefully made sure" and that there was no proof according to which jury would have been enlivened by passion.
But it does not seem to be the last word on question.
Courts of appeal admit for decades that the media cover of well-known cases are possible raise questions on the equity of a trial.
In a judgement of 1966 which made its mark, the Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the condemnation of an osteopath of Cleveland, the Dr Sam Sheppard, for the assassination of his wife, supporting in its decision that there was a "atmosphere of carnival in trial" because of media.
Crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the programme of television and film " The fugitive ."
Some lawyers declared that the courts of call grabbed to see again half a century later the condemnation of Mr Hayes can be curious given the argument according to which of new rules could be necessary to manage the communications media of the rooms of audience, unimaginable at the time of the case of the Dr Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to get worried about the impact of new media" in large-scale trials, declared John J. Donohue III, a professor at the school of Stanford's Right which studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which it was arbitrarily applied.
The professor Donohue maintains that some judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of instantaneous communication from the rooms of audience could allow trials more just.
The case of Twitter is only one there among many others described by the lawyers of Mr Hayes, likely to be discussed during years; what postpones execution.
The counsels for the defence maintain also, for example, that Mr Hayes would have suffered a detriment when the judge Blue refused to allow them to put to the test the reactions of the potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal stages during the selection of jury.
Some of the jurors declared to have been horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years.
The counsels for the defence maintain that they are going also to question the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will support that the judge unfairly evicted one of sworn, who had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and that he excessively put pressure for a verdict by made the unusual decision to lead jury to deliberate in weekend.
Jurors were not sequestrated.
But their arguments on the effect of the intense media cover of trial could be the biggest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, deposited last month, that case dominated the media stage in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor's post and for the Senate of the United States.
They supported that computer media did not cease stirring the fire of the emotion of affair.
"The daily crush of the tweets of media, cameras and the journalists in front of the law courts," wrote the lawyers, "resembled nothing of what has had been before seen here, in New Haven, and perhaps even on a national scale."
Their accent on the cover of the system Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists declared that the affirmation, according to which instantaneous news was more incendiary than press releases delayed more slowly, was a luddiste view which would impoverish the policy of the Court governing the media cover of future trials.
But some lawyers declared that courts of appeal étaitent often attracted by arguments according to which social and technological changes required an adaptation by courts.
The lawyers of Mr Hayes stress this claim.
In their file, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which had overturned the condemnation of the Dr Sheppard because of the media cover of trial and they added that they would invoke the need of new rules for new media.
" This affair ," they wrote," represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can the civility bring closer to cleavages?
After a campaign marked by invective and négativité, a minimum of civility burst in Washington this week.
Is it about a harbinger of a true bipartite cooperation forward or of delusive instant before the quick return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between the president Obama and the leaders of the Congress produced no breakthrough on the big questions which must be treated in the course of the session of the "lame duck."
But obviously, there was at least a polished debate on difference of both parts as well as on recognition of their responsibilities shared to govern, rather than another episode where every camp wanted to score goals. space of notation supporter.
The public meeting of Wednesday of the committee on the deficit of the president was also civilised, in spite of political divergences which reside between the members.
It seems clear that the narrow correlation of several months created a mutual respect transcending the ideological ditch; but who, however, still divides the members.
It is barely sufficient to declare that a new epoch of cooperation arrived.
Both parts are now in a trial period and period of put to the test mutual insurance company with a view to getting signs of cooperation and of compromise, while trying to assess the borders of public opinion and of patience of the voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the meeting of Tuesday and the subsequent comments of the participants revealed a minimum of requirements or of accusations.
Philosophical difference between Obama and the republicans is too big and too deep to suggest a quick change of climate which existed in the course of two last years.
That it is about taxation, about expenses, about healthcare or rights, both parts stay in miles of distance.
However, Novembre election had softened Washington, at least in short term.
"He makes no doubt which things changed on tone," declared Pete Wehner, a civil servant of the administration Bush, supporting next to the Centre of ethical and public Politics.
"It is unavoidable after elections.
Elections provoke partisan passions and, then, them if estomptent.
It is well."
On some questions, notably those on order of the day of the session of " lame duck ," the republicans and the democrats have other choice than to find a solution.
The tax reductions of Bush will expire at the end of the year, and nobody is in favour of it.
Both parts want to find a way of preserving from it a part or a group, permanently or temporary.
Also, a compromise is possible on the extension of the benefits of unemployment, it would be only because the republicans cannot take the liberty of giving the impression that they are in favour of tax cuts for the rich men, while refusing unemployment benefits the unemployed workers.
After the at Home white meeting of Tuesday, more optimism glides over a possible agreement regarding questions recalled in the course of the session relating to the "lame duck," with the ratification of pact " STARTING New ."
But William Galston, from Brookings Institution, informs that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of session "duck blade" no ménera not willy-nilly in a better understanding between both parties when the 112th congress will meet in January.
Instead of it, he says, a period of disagreement is probable, or even unavoidable.
"Once the things which must be made will be it, the psychology in short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed the scepticism widely shared according to which civility would drive to a true cooperation.
"I consider most what takes place between today and on 2012 as a pre-show or a shadow-boxing in comparison with the main event of 2012, said at-il.
Reasons are closely linked to the composition of the new republican majority at the Chamber and at the voters present at the tea who contributed to his creation.
However the republican leaders are aware of danger if they go too much far, they know that they have to try to be as high as their promises to reduce public expenditures and to to abrogate new law on healthcare.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first reactions to recommendations of the committee of deficit which include to reform the code of taxation and to augment some taxes, to push back the pensionable age and to reduce expenses.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to themselves, imposed the question of deficit on the public agenda of a way which cannot be unaware.
But they need at the committee 14 voices, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they found it difficult to attain this number.
The biggest resistance remains among the elected representatives of the group; what suggests that there is on tax questions, at least today, not enough motives or will of compromise.
Galston envisages two stages in battles between the White House and the republicans of the Congress.
The first one will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, given that the republicans question Obama in budget, in taxes and in healthcare; to be then followed by a period of bigger bipartite cooperation.
What would be the reason of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, in spite of the partisan mind of the recent election, a majority of the Americans always want to see both parties working together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as in 1995, then both parties will notice attentively the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged in loss will have to change cape and find compromises.
But it would be nevertheless an optimistic point of view.
Partisan mind and polarisation are bigger today than they were it in the middle of 1990s and there seems to be one more ideological splits between Obama and the republicans of the Congress only there was then between the president Bill Clinton and the republicans.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a simple is a prelude to a more consequent election in 2012.
Considering this reality, civility displayed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But one will need much more efforts on behalf of both parts to find a ground of understanding on the questions which still divide them.
Disclosed American documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of "Kleptocratie" and gets until Kremlin a part of slush money and of money of protection which it gathers, signalled the embassy of the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the federal Service of security accomplish huge rackets which contribute to explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They gather some money not only of legitimate firms but also organised criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what the prime minister Vladimir Putin called "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money walks along upwards to the ladder.
The service note, which was sent to Washington under the name of the ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Website.
The note is based on sources names of which were censored.
She was written while Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is kept to a great extent representative for corruption.
He was discharged in October by the president Dmitri Medvedev but there were since then few traces of cleaning.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a leading construction company, always disclaimed the accusations of corruption in the course of the years; and he earned several trials in defamation on these accusations.
In September, he declared what follows in a Russian television channel, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It is mad, it is to throw, it is anything."
The Russians think, in an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupted; according to opinion polls.
But it is unusual to find information enunciated in a report of embassy; and it is prodigious to conceive that it would belong to diplomats of a foreign country to make it.
The direct link established between the government of the city of Moscow and crime led some persons to name it of "Dysfonctionnel" and to maintain that the government worked more as a kleptocratie than a government," according to the note of the embassy.
"The criminal elements enjoy one" krysha " (term used in the world criminel/la mafia which means literally" roof" or protection) which crosses across the police, the federal Service of security (FSB), the ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, as well as all bureaucracy of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a structure with three levels in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is in the summit."
"FSB, MVD and militias are at the second level."
"Finally, the criminal common places and the corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is about an ineffectual system in which the criminal groups fill a space up in some domains where the city does not provide any services."
The report points out that FSB tosses the money of the biggest firms and that the police target the babies.
A source, he said, "explained that the owners of firm of Moscow understood that it was preferable to get the protection of MVD and of FSB (rather than groups of organised crime) because, not only, they have more weapon, more means and more power than the criminal groups but they are also protected by law."
"It is the reason for which the request of protection by the criminal gangs is not so high any more."
The note signals that, although the collection of the money is spread, protection can itself be unequal; even those who pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest.
Those who do not pay fast see their business closing under a pretext or other one.
Medvedev recalled several times the struggle against corruption but he accepted not enough progress.
The note of the embassy transmits count-returns mentioning men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, until Kremlin.
"In its struggle against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," declared in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, guiding of "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class because in Russia is not."
Without policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is unavoidable.
According to Indem, the costs of corruption would come, on the scale of Russia completely, to more than 300 thousand million dollars a year.
The country was classified 154th in a recent opinion poll on the total perception of corruption by the non-governmental organisation Transparency International (countries are classified at least in the most corrupt).
The disclosure of the note of the American embassy, which has was realised that yesterday, late in party, Moscow time, will move with certainty of discontent within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be criticised, to a certain extent, for the chess of Moscow, it could occasion Kremlin to show that he is resolving problem.
Interviewed by CNN by Larry King, Putin issued hypothesis that the documents of WikiLeaks could be a manufacture and reacted with anger in front of the purposes which diplomats of the United States had disclosed by calling it Batman and by bringing closer to Medvedev de Robin.
"Problem is based on the fact that it is about our correlation, factor importing domestic policy in this country, he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that it would be accomplished with such self-importance, such pressure and, you know it, in opposition to the ethics."
The war veterans of the red Khmers made to confront past
In a schoolroom badly lighted with walls in low-grade decrepit concrete, the manager of the high school of Anlong Veng recalled the man who had constructed it, the last leader of the red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"Everybody here likes Ta Mok."
"It was a good leader; and he cared about his people," declared Sreng Kor Ma, 42-year-old.
Known as " the butcher " for his brutality, when he was at the head of the red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this bastion isolated from ancient red Khmers in the northwest of Cambodia where he made construct hospitals, bridges and other facilities; and where thousands of ancient soldiers of the organisation live even today.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmers went to the government, the longstanding fidelity is finally called into question in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum of the truth and of reconciliation allowed to the victims to face publicly people who had participated in regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook there of high school which, for the first time, teaches the history of the red Khmers to the children of its ancient soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, pronounced its first sentence concerning an ancient member of the red Khmers, by condemning, in 35 years of prison, the ancient leader of notorious centre of torture of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch."
In front of this evolution of situation, anxiety augmented to the war veterans of the red Khmers of Anlong Veng; complicating efforts of reconciliation and their wills to re-be inserted in the Cambodian society.
"There are resentments and fright among the ancient red Khmers but they are powerless to make whatever it is," declared Chhang Youk, manager of the Resource centre of Cambodia, an independent organism which performs researches on regime.
"For them, life under the red Khmers was glorious but regime became a symbol of the trouble."
"Situation generates divisions within families."
Under the reign of the red Khmers in Cambodia, from 1975 till 1979, about 1,7 million persons was carried out or died of hunger, of illness or overwork.
When the Vietnameses pervaded and overturned the government of Pol Pot - Joined in 1979, the rest of regime and its army ran away towards the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There, they threw an insurrection which lasted until the last of movements goes in December, 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary ran the guerilla of their base located in the Western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a continuation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of 1990s, after a peace agreement backed by the UNO drove to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, big groups of combatants red Khmers began making desertion to the government, culminating with the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and of Nuon Chea and of Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died from natural reasons in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by governmental force in 1999 in mountains close to Dangrek.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 by waiting for his trial.
Without their benefactors, most war veterans red Khmers sank into common, black misery in the rural regions of Cambodia; and there are many people who remain nostalgic of movement.
Although some high-flying officers red Khmers kept their posts of local leader to have laid down weapon, it is about farmers not qualified in weak rank and file.
"These persons benefited of little of monitoring after the capitulation," declared Sok Leang du Centre for justice and reconciliation which organises public forums in all Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are soaked in the agricultural utopian ideology of regime."
"They were raised in a frame where to be doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55-year-old, who joined the red Khmers as teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before becoming established in 1998 as farmer poor man of rice.
"The life under the red Khmers was good," he said.
"Ta Mok feeds everybody."
But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs."
The court of the ongoing red Khmers also caused worries here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, start the judgement of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and of her wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister red Khmer.
The mandate of the court is to judge the high leaders and the main representatives for crimes but he did not say if he continued beyond these four cases.
Would be needed more to tranquilize fears in Anlong Veng.
The last media speculations turned to Im Chaem, 64-year-old, ancient leader of region in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the red Khmers in 1970s.
In 2007, she said to the researchers of the Resource centre of Cambodia that she had supervised the building of the dam of Trapeang Thma, a plan where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a torrid party, Im Chaem came back from job to the field located near the frame house on stilt, on a dirt track outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun threw long shadows on the grass dried out, Im Chaem refused to discuss the past within the red Khmers.
If the court called her, she says, she would refuse to go there.
"L'évaluation de Le Cambodge demi-cadratin paix et ferme," à - elle dit.
"If there are more chases, there will be war."
The prime minister Hun Sen, who made desertion of the red Khmers in 1978, also informed again and again that an instability would occur if the court followed several suspects; although the experts and the historians question it.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury past, said the at-il.
But to confront past is all that Cambodia must make to go of the front, says Youk Chhang, of the resource centre.
"Reconciliation in terms Khmer is to re-link the broken pieces, he says.
"We must put these pieces together so that we could understand."
The centre produced the first textbook approved by the government on the red Khmers, "A history of democratic Kampuchea, composed of 75 pages."
It distributed him in Anlong Veng in June as supplement to the textbooks of history of the ministry of Education, conceived for the high schools, which contained less than four pages on the red Khmers.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng do not know that some details on the red Khmers, in spite of the links of the city in regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old, student at the high school of Anlong Veng, declared that the new textbook helped the students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book at home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court," he says.
"They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will follow."
Such resistance returned the process of complex and difficult reconciliation, declared Sok Leang.
Mais les publics de forum, le manuel et le tribunal le commencent à avoir un l'impact, à - il dit.
However, the red Khmers keep a powerful atrait here.
In the height of the mountains of Dangrek, a way, pervaded by the bad grasses and interspersed with plastic bags, driven up to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a roof of sheeting made rusty.
The body of Pol Pot was burnt here on a pile of tyres after its death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31-year-old, seller of mobile phone next to road, said that she did not know about it a lot about the man who was burnt in this place.
"But he has a big mind; and many inhabitants go there to pray, she says.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea and, later that day, she planned to walk towards the last place of rest of Pol Pot where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing chance.
Byelorussia agrees to abandon its supply of uranium of military quality
The government of Byelorussia announced on Wednesday that he is going to leave its supply of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this décison registers as part of a surprised victory of the campaign of the president Obama to reassure nuclear material worldwide
Agreement was disclosed in a published joint press release after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here Byelorussian minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, outside a summit on security.
The American government had tried during years to persuade Byelorussia to abandon the highly enriched uranium and the horizon last spring seemed to have cleared.
But the American representatives declared in Washington Post that some classified operations were accomplished with Byelorussia in the course of two last months to eliminate 187 books of the uranium of military quality from a research centre of Byelorussia.
It opened the way to an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the rest of material about 500 books, according to a civil servant who recalled the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of question.
Agreement seems to be one of the results the most important of the Summit of nuclear Security of 47 nations, organised on the initiative of Obama; where Byelorussia was excluded.
Obviously, it was beneficial to give an invitation to the Soviet ex-republic following the summit, in 2012.
"I am really fascinated due to the fact that they want a seat at the top of nuclear Security of nuclear 2012 Summit of security."
"It proves me that this process works," declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for worldwide security, a group of promotion of nuclear security.
Clinton qualified agreement "as very significant, important stage" accomplished by Byelorussia.
Obama got involved in Prague in April, 2009 to reassure all vulnerable nuclear material across the world in coming four years.
Since then, the American government helped six countries to get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Byelorussia would be the seventh.
A dozen of countries made it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Summit on the nuclear security of Obama, the Byelorussian president, Alexander Loukachenko, declared that the nation would never abandon its uranium.
"We kept some highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilogrammes of what is principally some uranium of military quality and of some slightly enriched uranium," said then Mr Loukachenko.
"It is our product... We are not going to fabricate dirty bombs, and we are going to sell it to nobody."
"We are going to use it for research aims, it is everything."
Byelorussia got closer to the United States some months ago; however, by demonstrating interest to reach an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Byelorussia, in October, was particularly complicated because the equipment had been slightly irradiated, pointed out representatives.
He was loaded on a special train which went through more than 1 300 miles up to an installation in Russia to stocked and be eliminated, pointed out representatives.
The second operation was finished on Monday and accomplished by air, according to the representatives.
The American government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, to a great extent to replace the research facilities of Byelorussia with some slightly enriched uranium; maladjusted for weapon.
"A meticulous coordination and an organisation were implemented with a view to reinforcing confidence"; driving so to the agreement signed by Clinton, declared Andrew Bieniawski, a representative for the department of energy specialised in the Reduction of worldwide Threat.
According to estimates of the Centre of Study of Nonproliferation James Martin, Byelorussia was this year at least 88 books of uranium of military quality, as well as hundreds of kilogrammes of highly enriched uranium.
Byelorussia tries to eliminate its supplies by 2012, according to a joint statement.
Relations between Byelorussia and the United States are tense many years, mainly because of hard suppression by Loukachenko des Droits de l' homme.
But the statement of Wednesday suggested a potential resurgence.
"Very pleased about progress on these questions of worldwide security, the United States and Byelorussia admitted that a respect augmented for democracy and Human rights in Byelorussia remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and necessary to the progress of the country and its citizens," she declared.
The government issued no objection to flights of the CIA
The government issued no objection to flights of the CIA with prisoners Taliban and of Al Qaeda in direction Guantanamo has foible of the Spanish territory, according to a telegramme of the ambassador of States Unis in Madrid.
It is shown by filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks in the daily El País, who adds that the first vice-president of the Government of this epoch, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that Spanish Executive is informed for "power to show that they exercised an adequate alertness over the foreign planes which crossed Spain."
In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe which accused human rights of complicity in practices opposite in to a dozen of countries, among that Spain, took place a meeting between the ancient North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president admitted that the report of Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero offside" and insisted the fact that Spain had nothing there to hide.
"From Vega underlined that Spain does not have objection as regards flights of intelligence by top of the Spanish territory."
"They only want to be informed" to avoid that they "Aguirre in a cable is unexpectedly taken," they relate.
The holder of the Ministry of External of this epoch, Miguel Á ngel Moratinos, signalled to the ambassador that Spanish Executive "wanted to give in this affair profiles him lower possible, even if, as she was at the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence."
In its turn, in the January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he is not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask for the declassification of the documents of the National Centre of Intelligence (CNI) and of the Ministry of Defence on flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain no accusing element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy having spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States showed their preoccupation nevertheless for "visible coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for déclassifiée information of CNI O of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between the independent investigateurs will complicate our efforts to manoeuver case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In the March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented him that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will make what they consider to be adequate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of an ignited rhetoric, by trying to lower the temperature."
The ambassador also expresses his preoccupation for the action of PP in this affair.
"In spite of its pro-American general direction, our experience suggests the fact that PP indeed will take advantage of any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero tolerated or was deliberately unaware of the actions of the United States which could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences as the Government of the United States," she signals.

The members of the Popular Party would earn 4 seats in the Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 18-N, PP could be decisive in the municipes of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase of polls and deputies recorded in last autonomiques elections, Catalan PP has already aimed at the dress rehearsals because, even if there is progress or not, perspectives are more than positive, because the number of polls which this training gets in this comices double normally the one whom it accepts in the Catalan.
So, the popular Catalans got 610.473 polls to the dress rehearsals of 2008, while in the autonomiques of 2006, they had got 316.222 from it.
The crossed Sunday, PPC got 384.091 polls.
If they support this ascending, desired tendency of a misappropriation of polls of PSC and fidélisation of the electorate of PP, the analysts of this training calculated the fact that, if there would be general election, PPC could past 8 - 12 deputies in the Congress, while CIU would also earn four (he has 10 of it now) and PSC would lose no more and no less 9 deputies (he has 25 of it).
This calculate would note that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular, ERC would lose a deputy - he has three of it now - while ICV would keep a deputy or earn one.
But if the agenda electoral stays, the most next appointment would take place in May of 2011 for the local comices, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in four capitals of province and in their relay at the head of Council general de Barcelona, one of the administrations who manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euro for 2011-.
As long the nationalists as the popular agree with the fact that PSC could lose the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would get the majority either the possibility of using their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
By taking into account of breaking up republican, it would not be unreliable that this training loses its representation in the city council of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5% polls.
PP augmented the number of polls in four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are persuaded due to the fact that they can be the protagonists of fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP recorded only a difference of 500 polls in comparison with PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, supports of very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met several times.
The popular recorded progress also in other important municipes as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, PP is present in 34 local governments at Catalonia and desires to form lists in a number maximum of localities.
The Catalan cell made easier thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Apart from seven prisoners in Barcelona, in Thailand there was three
Seven Pakistani and of Niger kept by agents of the police station General of Information of the Police of Barcelona formed a jihadiste cell which, run from Thailand, made passports easier for groups Al Qaida different, between whom "The Tigers for the Liberalisation of the Earth Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last being the author of the assassination attempts of Bombay which caused the death of 106 persons in 2008.
The Ministry of the Internal gave a big importance to these investigations, so as to make sure due to the fact that with operation Kampai " "was debilitated" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaida at international level and "as a result, its opérative capacity."
Investigateurs calculates that the cell, in two years during which it was active in Catalonia, could sent by the thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to the groups which included the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that his "combatants" could cross European Western borders and other countries with a complete impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one whom network jihadiste held opérative in Europe, it is for it that in investigations participated, apart from services Thai, other European police units, that is why in the territory of the European Union he could have next days of blows there similar to that recorded at night of Tuesday crossed in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (they kept Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and of Niger Babatunde Agunbiade), in Thailand other one, with the capture of Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung was unwound.
They props those who ran since Bangkok the cell established in Spain and in other European countries.
Catalan network - a part of which was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists the passports which satisfied conditions marked by " worldwide called Islamic Forehead ."
It is to say documents had to be in name of young men between 25 and 45 year old, with a long-lived validity and without visas printed.
Investigateurs underlines that until now they found no detail which links the prisoners in Catalonia with the assassination attempt of Bombay, even if the author of this attack, " Laskar e Taiba ," was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless it is necessary to remind of the fact that a few days before of that this assassination attempt is made, of Catalonia they sent that across an agency of transfers thousand dollars which were "invested" to buy cards of motives which were afterwards used by the integrant of the "commando" which killed 106 persons.
The Police took over abundant one material.
PP asks Farmhouse in Provence that he suspends tax complicity
The leader of PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had opportunity yesterday to display his conditions personally to Artur Mas to support his investiture as president of Generalitat, identical to the those displayed during the campaign and who come down to give priority to the recovery of economy and misses him philo-souverainistes adventures as the economic complicity is which the nationalist leader wants to approach in the middle of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans arrived at appointment with Artur Mas with the safety which gives fact to have got 18 deputies to elections the crossed Sunday, a number more than enough for being liked, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the trainings qu will exercise oppositions refrains in the voting of investiture.
On a possible understanding with PP future alliances depend that the nationalists want to support in the Congress during general election, but, for the moment, dialogues which Farmhouse in Provence has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as regards the president of the PP, to support an investiture "it would be necessary to eliminate all speeches souverainistes and independence," and economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the converging leader wants to subject even to referendum.
Both leaders share their bet to make slenderize the political apparatus of an autonomique administration very exaggerated and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of negotiation on the investiture of Farmhouse in Provence will take care on behalf of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Farmhouse in Provence has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will make him with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric maintains that the dead was not owed to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the centre of Olot do not eliminate possibility of that their night male nurse kills more than 11 old persons
The representatives for the geriatric The Caritat d' Olot (Gérone) gave a press conference yesterday to underline damages caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the male nurse who killed at least eleven old persons to whom it was responsible meanime that he worked on it.
The manager of the residence, Joan Sala, came accompanied by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of Caritat would be that to be able to exercise accusation against the representative" for the dead but "legality and responsibility make us take the processuelle situation of civil representatives."
And apart from the social discréditation where entity could suffer not to have discerned on time the criminal activities of the night male nurse, the big threat for Caritat takes now the form of an important indemnity which the lawful representatives of the parents of the victims already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates from August, 2009 and that from that day it did not cease killing.
The judge mentioned in sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - ancient patients of the geriatric - care he suspected that in a lot of case no doctor explored the dying personally but, being given the age and the pathologies of the patients, formality took place by telephone.
Caritat, across her manager, disclaimed this situation categorically yesterday and mentioned that "the lack of measures can have been at no instant the reason of what took place."
The lawyer of Caritat added that "in this affair there is only one indication of imprudence on behalf of any other person than the defendant is."
The person already called as " the Angel of Death " confessed 11 assassinations the day before yesterday and itemised that he committed the first crime August 29th, 2009 and one and a half month later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case he caused him death by injecting him a sober - dose of insulin, in difference of the first crime which he had committed with a sedative mix of pastilles.
The manager of Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the personnel of the centre to medicines.
The injections of insulin and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of nine crimes which the male nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the internal, used to kill them.
But the analyses of laboratory will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he searched a death for his first victims less cruel or by the opposite he burnt them indoors by giving them washing as he has already confessed that he made with three women that he killed 12 meanime - October 17th.
Caritat does not believe statements of the night male nurse, either confessed number of assassinations, they do not eliminate possibility of that the number is bigger and justify their attitude by different versions that Vila gave in its visits to the Higher level court and the lack of logic in the change of the way to kill having made eight assassinations successfully.
It is for it that they declare that they will stay at disposition of justice to clarify the range of facts.
BCE threatens
The investors have which react shortly to the yesterday threat of Trichet yesterday told that "markets have not to underestimate our capacity of reaction."
The differentials of peripherals closed in force and the actions of banks European suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not either underestimate the capacity of BCE to make a mistake and the euro barely recorded an incrément, what is an anxious signal.
What occurred yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as he collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will hesitate to lose fright.
One month ago, BCE has named us today to withdraw measures of liquidity and he will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who stay there.
Bundesbank demanded the revision of the plan of purchase of national debt because of its ineffectiveness and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity urgent and leaving only limitless access to week.
After Irish crisis let us hope that the current measures of liquidity "at least until March" are extended and they support the quarterly auction with limitless access at the end of quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that they will go on with the programme of purchase of obligations and that signal is even given to intensify it.
If they do not fulfil the prudent approaches generated, they will overturn the very good reaction of markets yesterday and if they go on blinded to withdraw the measures of liquidity, which God helps to us!
As well as during their meeting of May in which they maintained that they had not even envisaged the purchase of obligations and they have markets collapsé, history would be able to repeat tomorrow.
BCE must be believable and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought a lot, by causing a new collapse on the market.
Yesterday the bidding of milking in one year in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 millions in 5,28% in comparison with 750 millions in 4,81% bidding previous.
Even so, types in Portugal lowered 30 basic points in all curve, and reflecting apparently a change of feeling of market after the words of Trichet.
In Ireland they published the figures of the hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Figures estimated represent 10.000 short-term millions and 15.000 potentials and they have a delay until February to get the private capital or they will be nationalised.
Even if Ireland has no credibility not having discerned problem in July with the trial of stress, figures are assumables in the Plan of Assistance and help to reduce by uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get the parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not have another sufficient support, as a result Ireland stays in a home of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to unloose tension before the next Summit of the Heads of state and of Government on December 14th in which it is necessary to find a political compromise which shows that we are an union and that we all interpret the same partition.
Problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the hymn of Beethoven's joy remains it.
In Spain, the president had opportunity to introduce the plan of measures yesterday which the Council of ministers will approve on Friday.
Re-form pensions, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate job ring in hearings of the investors as four seasons of Vivaldi.
Double effect Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Stock Market suffered 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European Stock Markets.
In February difference, the reaction of the Government and of Bank of Spain was quick and radical and we benefit from effect surprised.
Today there is one bidding-key of an obligation in three years which will be benefited by effect Trichet, as a result we hope that this one is resolved with a strong request and helps to dispel doubts on our capacity of refinancing.
For Spain to ask for a Plan of Assistance would be an auto-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury is more than 40.000 millions in available liquidity, the triple in comparison with March, in very expensive types and they cut the access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, strategy must continue being that of the wife of Caesar, "apart of being, appearance."
Courage, we can take out there!
The president of Eulen will question the advice of Vega Sicilia asked by his sons
The storm does not cease in the conflict opened in the breast of the family Á lvarez, possessing Eulen and El Enebro.
David Á lvarez, founder of the group, will question, because he considers him "everyone of right," the judicial advice of El Enebro the fellow 16, solicited by five of his seven sons in which they will try to emphasise their majority and to take over organs of management of the tenured business company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Á lvarez and his sons Jesús Davids and María José grant their lawful battery for the new chapter of their litigation for control on one hand of the group.
The founder of holding company bigger of services of business for companies does not appear to be willing to give in in his litigation to be present in the organs of direction of El Enebro.
From his directorate he was excluded by five of his seven sons who were called administrators in the assembly of the shareholders of January 18th this year which protest is recorded in the Register of Trade and of Societies.
The judicial advice of El Enebro for the fellow 16, called by the magistrate sales and marketing person Numéro 2 of Madrid, opened once again the box of thunders within the family Á lvarez.
The appeal to the judge to fix the assembly is, until conflict is resolved, the only mechanism which guaranteed the convocation of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Á lvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Á to be lvarez as a "appeal despaired of the applicants his five sons to try, has foible a quibble processuelle, by defrauding Law apparently and by fooling right, to validate and to correct the assembly radically no one on January 18th," according to its doors-words officials.
This argumentation will be the base so that, once the assembly takes place, is questioned by considering that this one is "no one by right."
The same protagonists, who support a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate calls an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and tenured society of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, between other assets, the threads of David Á lvarez control 100% capitals.
The founder of the group of services solicits usufruct nevertheless on 51% capitals, according to the familiar protocols.
This affair is the thorough question on which the judge must decide after audience at the request of protest as which there is not another signalled date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software creates improvements on cars on time real.
As soon as Red Bull entered the world of the Formula 1 in 2004, its history in it exclusive world of the speed was marked by surprise and by success.
In first instant, nobody held in count options of a new stable which had just arrived, in spite of the ascending trajectory of last seasons, past in November, in the last stage of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering skill as pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, either the capacity of the engine Renault which projects its car, in the world of the Formula 1 they speak of the legend of '"arm secret" that the multinational Siemens company put in the hands of Red Bull to transform it in one winning team.
It is in reality about a powerful software of simulation of process which the German company threw on the market in 2007 with objectives very distant from high automobilistique competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument was used to create chaines of assemblage of plants producers of everybody, of stations of energy, instruments of high precision.
Objective is to reproduce, to simulate truthfully product or process before constructing it in a real way, by avoiding so defects and avoidable costs.
PLM made easier the development of the cameras of Cannon, planes of Sukhoi or of the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its plant of Formula 1 allowed Red Bull to create and to carry out "shortly after of the hours, almost real-time," modifications, changes and improvements discerned during shopping and trials.
Russwurm explains that the stables of year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams which was capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles every season.
In the team of Red Bull work 180 professional young people of high skills today who, equipped powerful computer equipment analyses and cast very kind of modifications on racing cars.
The leader of Siemens explained that PLM software is capable of analysing and of improving all elements of the racing cars of Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and elements of security are changed.
Changes can cross the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high-tech.
As only limitation of this madness of technological refinement there is 40 million dollar sum that every team of Formula 1 can spend every season as border to make competition easier.
Red Bull established the plant of high-tech to create and to produce its racing cars in a locality in 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for the journalists, are restrained.
All that takes place there is considered "top-secret."
The personnel for this duty counts 580 persons, enclosed two pilots, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The héro of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the huge technological resources which the mark of energy drinks has brings into service its participation in circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is invaluable and any notability.
The manager of technology of the plant, Steve Nevey, maintains that five years ago it would be possible to maintain that progress of R+D in the case of cars of shopping brought 50% victories and the pilots were representative besides.
Today these percentages changed and technology represents 85% successes, while the pilots bring 15% added values.
Nevey confesses that Vettel or Webber will be never replaced with computer science, because "they are unforeseen gladiators."
HP will instal clean shops in two twenties with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona its first exclusive shop in collaboration with its associate Bridge Reyes.
It will be the first of the network of 20 trade between 80 and 100 square metres which the multinational envisages to instal in Spain during two next years.
The company will count this initiative with 16 already present zones in centres multimark as PC City, Crossroad, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as example the altered shop located on Gran Vía of Barcelona, property of Bridge Reyes, with whom it has been 30 years since she collaborates.
The North American group prepared a plan to establish 200 points of leading sale in Europe in 2013, strategy which includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opening were those of Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, that of Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal next possible shops, even if she confessed that Madrid could be following destination.
The head of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of shops will always be the same, with the help of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group recommends and takes care of the conception of the exclusive furniture of shops (with products which can be touched in an interactive way), who in Europe will hold an identical picture.
Besides, HP covers the training of the personnel of establishments.
Helena Herrero disclaimed that it is a franchising and underlined that the exclusive network of trade pretends "to improve the service given to the clients and in PMES in purchase, assistance, post sale and even packing."
The shop of Barcelona includes a space with a pilot programme pioneer at worldwide level which resolves the possible problems of the computer equipment of HP in guarantee.
An online service links with one technical centre located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So, in 10 minutes we can resolve problems which can often take even two days."
"This system is especially conceived for MPES and users, because the big companies have already contracted desks of technical assistance," pointed out yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets on 'stealing ' a million clients from his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the executive director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be one year hard for banking sector, but rejects initially a new crisis of liquidity and predicts the end of the war of liability.
Nevertheless, he envisages a collapse of the margins of interests, which will be tried to compensate partly with incréments of committees and of price of credit.
Sabadell wait pick up in three years a million particular clients, his task to be fulfilled.
Sabadell found a way to be exploited during three futures years and to be able to survive so in a very complicated economic environment.
He bank will start in 2011 a new battle plan which will hold one goes labilité of three years.
Objective, apart to survive without necessity to use the public subsidies of FROB, is to earn a quotation of market by the illegal securement of a million new particular clients - 700.000 if they deduct those who could take out of bank, its big task to be fulfilled, because until now it forks out had spoilt more PMES and societies than particular client.
This year he picked up 250.000 particular clients and 50.000 societies.
Its quotation of market to the individuals is 3,5%, while to societies it exceeds 10%.
Another base of plan 2011-2013 is bet on productiveness, or what is the same thing, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as objective, provocations of which will be explained by it bank when he introduces the results of financial year.
Few banks dare currently to fix objectives and to make them public, because financial crisis disturbed all plans of worldwide banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalise this year the battle plan Optimum, establishes he ya is four years old, even if initially plan has been for three years, but the situation of the market determined its continuation for exercise furthermore.
The clients who let get away the cases of savings will be his main objective.
During a breakfast organised by APIE, Guardiola stressed the fact that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, indeed, thinks that the exit of crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Besides, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create workstations," what is fundamental for the survival of banking affair, has him insisted.
And even if he thinks that the war of liability - who penalises margins - is reduced, the price of the risk premiums which banks and cases pay for its programmes to get from liquidity already move at the price of credit to compensate for the fall of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and of financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We did not grip the tap, but differentials are higher," admitted Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to the network to limit the long-term credit and to augment the price of differentials - to see CincoDías of November 22nd and 27th.
He also confessed that the tendency of banking sector now "is to augment committees," but "there is a competitive frame."
The battle plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of accomplishing corporative operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "bigger dimensions will be solicited."
"Everything will move next year," he assured has.
He maintains that necessities of capital "augment tremendously" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
And he mentions that FROB can replace the market in the illegal securement of fund in the case of recapitalisations news.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive at the close temporal of markets, he diminished importance due to the fact that some banking predict already as a new crisis of liquidity.
He signals that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what took place in June, it is possible to get the short-term financing through rest, what attenuates crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second merger wave among cases
The managing director of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new wave of fusion of cases of savings yesterday and stressed once again the speed with which complies the restructuring of the sector.
When the trial of concentration of the cases of Spanish savings began, there were several entities which assured that they are not going to participate in this first stage and that they saved themselves for the second stage.
Nevertheless, the managing director of the Spanish Confederation of Cases of Savings (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations yesterday.
"I think that the biggest part of fusion was accomplished, it is not possible to say that the enlistment of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is a second stage, these are adjustments."
"Most was completely accomplished; it is possible that instead of 17 they go to 13 or 14, but all big processes were already accomplished under the supervision of Bank of Spain, which collaborated in this operation a lot also," underlined the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of the Leaders and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta displayed that the process of concentration comes true "at most possible high speed and we must be very satisfied of way that it comes true for the delays when they fixed in the past, not now, in the plans of business with it Bank of Spain," has emphatisé-t-il.
"The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28.500 million volumes of assets in 17 with 75.500 millions is an unequelled trial in history, by reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much bigger to comply in Basel," it underlined has.
Olavarrieta admitted that '"there is a series of little happy opinions on the slowness of process" which show "a lack of sérosité and of sense," because "what he Bank of Spain makes is to remind that it is necessary to respect the delay before end of year."
The managing director of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the strictest financial system of all Europe and "probably " of the world and he allocated to the persons who call him into question a "lack of knowledge."
The leader mentioned that being given current economic situation, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and of cases of savings, a system which began a "very important" process of concentration and "goes to the possible bigger speed."
He also reminded that Spanish banking sector came well through it of tests of stress which BCE accomplished in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin opted for staying in the euro, but he has establishes conditions for all Union.
The tensions of markets caused a governmental doble answer.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary tax reductions for PMES, regulation of agencies deprived of investment or 426 euro abolition of assistant to the unemployed persons without professional contribution in privatisation of 49% of AENA, of the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% Raffles of the State.
Of other one, the vice-president Elena Salgado, with the support of the former president Felipe González, unites with the criticisms of the chancellor Angela Merkel as regards her responsibility to detach current crisis.
How is it necessary to interpret these movements?
It is necessary to mention that the position of Merkel is not one error in its conversational policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining of the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, that shocks with that to support the ancient traditions of most his partners.
Facing European resistance, in Germany they begin speculating about three possible exits of crisis.
The first one, a strong euro, included by itself, Austria and Holland, between other countries, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems to be science invention, with a very favourable current of opinion, near one 50% populations.
The third, a new conception of the euro, online with German proposals for bigger one macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines in the countries which infringe them, of possible suspensions of payments of one of them and extension to the sector deprived of costs of potential adjustments.
German position is clear and it has been a long time since it defines itself, as a result now there is not place as excuses.
First, in 2009, when so much IMF as the European Commission stimulated deficit, the German Government invented one re-forms constitutional to prevent them from 2016.
It was the first signal of divergence between the fact that Germany thought that it was necessary to make (essential plans tax and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, ci - includes France, practiced.
The second blow of the country centres European was when Merkel hardly extended the decision to save Greece.
From this instant she made the object of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and publishing were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel re-expresses a clear position, by asking re-forms her of treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and to oblige at the same time to the lenders deprived to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it threw Irish crisis and rest.
But its proposal, good that a bit sweetened, was approved and, months following, we should attend process of re-forms the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013.
Germany drew a red line of which she does not think to cross.
And she says to all us that, even if now it is necessary to take measures with which they are can be not too much agreed, from this date there the ancient functioning of the euro would have finished.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries which infringe rules will be severely punished, they can be obliged in it declared in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also support one party of costs.
Germany signals us that we must follow a strict way of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productiveness and competitiveness and external pays positive.
An alternative based on debt and building, with huge holes in the balance of payments, as the one who chaired Spanish growth in the years of boom, will not be simply tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear him.
It is not only a question of seeing out public deficit in 3% in 2013.
What we are asked is much harder.
And what he should not absolutely make in these circumstances is to deceive us ourselves.
I hope that current turbulence lets arrive towards us a bigger calmness.
And that they could grab opportunity that they gave us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the president Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double statement (re-form them promised after the meeting of past on Saturday with the big firms and the yesterday announcement of new measures) suggests that, in spite of the critics of Merkel, the way to thesis was opened that it is necessary to put order at home.
But the red line which Germany drew is there, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities which are envisaged, it is not possible to exclude that to leave a monetary zone too much filled with not very serious country.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to us to say that she had informed us of it.
Sports and fraud of law
Tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax show smartness but not will to avoid a sanction.
The expulsion cooked up in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of November 23rd against Ajax in the Champions League made cast a lot of ink on the anti-sports character of such behaviour and if both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is well known, some minutes before ending match (that their team already won apparently), both players deliberately wasted time when they made errors to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
So, and seen that Real Madrid will end up being leader of the group, both players will fulfil regulation sanction during the next match of the match of dam against Auxerre and be able to pass without cardboards to the next stage.
Finally, the committee of discipline of UEFA punished with two matches the coach of the team, José Mourinho and different economic sums to the implicated players.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances as this one or the similar is not a new practice, otherwise rather frequent in the world of football.
She is so spread as she makes left the ethos, the rules non-written, but coherent, these sports.
A part of debate appeared in related case owes to the fact that this had one as protagonist team of the entity of Real Madrid (who in his hymn shows nobility and honour and who in crossed occasions condemned for a fine to his players for similar acts) and in orchestrated dramatisation, he seems, by Mourinho, who adds an episode furthermore in his dilated history of histrionic and provocative technician.
Anyway, debate asks if this type of behaviour not forbids expressly by the contradicted regulations the principles of sports, that is to say, if with this actions one fraud of law is made; because, indeed, they are respectful actions with the sports regulations, but seem to elude his sense.
Question is to examine the type of detriment which they cause in sports mind.
One of the property that includes sports mind is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with this actions was not endangers, that is to say there was not violent game.
Other one of this property to that they allude with correct game is to avoid that equips him with players infracteurs the opposite team, what is of benefit in an unfair way what is not case either.
However, fact paradoxical of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not adapt to the fact that they characterise cheating o normally as fraud of law, because its violation of rules was not secretly accomplished to try to avoid sanction, but their action precisely tried to be the most obvious possible to accept the penalty of the referee.
They waited and they accepted sanction readily.
Another question is the type of advantage that infracteurs gets of intentionnées examined errors.
Here it seems necessary to note that they do not put in a situation of disadvantage in the rival and an advantage in the same match either is got, because of course the result of action assumes fact to leave their own team with fewer players.
And it is not an useful strategy for the next match either, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course advantage consists due to the fact that the players will begin the next stage of the Champions League without cardboards which could threaten their participation in a future match.
But it is a long-term advantage, with some degree of indecision, because the team could be suddenly eliminated and apart it, with this action the players fulfil a match of sanction and pass to the second cardboard cycle, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cardboards occurs with one at least than in the first cycle.
So that, to climb echelons up, it is not so clear as it is an advantage.
After all is said and done, this actions are not opposite to sports mind, of which being part nevertheless the catch of strategical decisions which favour benefit at the farthest of what rules allow.
In our case, the players did not operate to avoid the application of sanction (it would indeed be a case clear of fraud of law), m otherwise they chose rather the instant in which they submitted to her.
They made a strategical decision without evading penalty or escaping that one.
Even if the border between genius and fraud of law is diffuse, in this occasion I think that there was a case clear of genius.
Debate, it seems to me, appears because of two factors: because there was two auto-expulsion and because of the way to transmit the head to cause them.
The trouble caused in the principles of sports by this actions is not so much ethical as aesthetics.
Offensive of the giving to pick up Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of celebrations self-financing by the employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euro.
As touron and raffle, when in December arrives also return have dinner to them on groups before Christmas which continue being the oxygen bottle for restaurants and entertainment of Barcelona, but because of crisis unblock in an offensive you with prices adjusted to be possible pick up to the majority client: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euro on dinners or meal, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To finish complicating accountancy, calendar of this year (as the night of sylvan Saint falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13th, having as result until now an avalanche of reservations of dinners for days peak (17 and 17) and almost anything previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult time, he ya many companies which eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To support tradition, many employees organise them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever is the situation, they ask for all prices of battle, confirms the president of Gremi of Restauraci ó of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers', currently, does not dare to predict how holidays this month will be.
"People thinks a lot before reserving."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," he mentions.
Affair will go well "for those who give quality to good price and with a good service," he adds, and reminds that the clients have the tendency to take an echelon down with crisis, so that the edge around 25 euro became majority in request.
In an opinion poll in various establishments of the centre the collapse of requests for the night of 17 is determined.
The Soteras group points out that there is an authentic boom of requests for this Friday, with claim to spend less than 30 euro, which they answered by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete 25 - 35-euro expressions.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, Founded It and others), the feature of the calendar assumed more preliminary reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We made the impossible to support the same prices of last year, with menus for all 19,95 - 30-euro tastes," they itemise.
YEAR Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QUQU and complete one of 23 places, stays optimist having discerned a development of the invoicing for the second semestre and of the good, although concentrated, perspective of business for Christmas.
Sources of the group mention that 18 a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends will also be who celebrate holidays ahead of time.
In to them six menus of group they added one for Christmas, with 30 euro or more as famous budget and perception of than there is a predisposition to spend one 10% more than the last year instead of demanding more details, as the Catalan wine fabricated according to the champagne method - ' Cava '.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies invite their employees once again and feeling that the volume of groups augmented little.
On behalf of the employers Fecasarm (which include entities as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of beginning seeing the final of the tunnel and supports that on the whole reservations are "enlivened," even if the clients "negotiate at the farthest."
It is true, the hope as regards festivities did not go down, indifferently of whom pay, he points out.
The Pakistani nuclear programme generates a great concern to the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with "a quicker rhythm than other country matters only."
Les filtrations de Les de Wikileaks confirment la la connexion entre les Taliban et le Pakistan.
The contents of correspondence between the American embassy of Pakistan and the Department of the State of the United States filtered by the portal Wikileaks confirm huge concerns that the Pakistani nuclear programme causes in Washington.
Apart from the flare and tasty details which give on the contents of dialogues and thought of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, documents reveal the fact that the cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security, instead of augmenting, "drops" and that unstable Asiatic country produces nuclear weapons "with a quicker rhythm than any other country of the world."
The feature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapon is not put together, but they are emmagasinnées by components to return difficult their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons of worries in Washington.
That's how the ambassador in Pakistan, Ann W. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the ancient adviser of National security, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear facilities of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of the nuclear materials of which noise runs and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The big number of persons implicated in nuclear naval shipyards and in missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as augmentative and a reason to support the nurse.
"Pakistan has to engage of the personnel with one strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; being given the fall of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who works in the nuclear programmes or missiles" the expert Yuri Korolev, the Ministry declared External Russian during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new of the material filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is cooperation every time more reduced between States Unis et Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and high Pakistani degree of production of armed nuclear technologies.
A dispatch of the Embassy in May, which qualifies communication as "frustrating" with Pakistan, supports what follows: "Transparency am often nonexistent; help offer stays without answer or is eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of National Intelligence for the south of the Asia, notes that "in spite of economic disaster, Pakistan produces weapon nuclear with a quicker rhythm than any other country of the world."
The ambassador Patterson also asks in Washington, during a visit of the leader of the Army, the general Ashfaq Kayani, that he makes understand " very apparently " to the representative that "the Army of Pakistan must finish with the tacit support to the terrorist groups."
À la chasse du chef de Wikileaks
Obama will number high representative in one for anti-terror struggle to avoid new seepages.
Interpol issues a red alert to follow movements and to locate in Assange.
Everything aspects linked in Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form complicated one maze where it is difficult to be certain on facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" "to locate and to follow movements" by Assange.
Nevertheless, it is not about a traditional order of arrest.
On top of that, this one is not new, otherwise him date of November 20th.
And this one has nothing in or even with the last filtering of more than quarter a million diplomatic documents of the United States but with the accusations of sexual abuse which the Australian confronts in Sweden.
On top of that, the creative lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police knows where and how to contact mister Assange."
20 the international police body having the seat in Lyons (France) dictated order at request of Sweden, but it was not it public to yesterday, having accepted the permission of the authorities of this country.
So, 188 countries of Interpol accepted indication to identify or to locate Assange "to get his provisional arrest and his extradition."
Even if Interpol cannot give the order of arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many people of countries members, according to explanation of the organisation, consider call red note a free way for the arrest - that the national body of the police must accomplish - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as it is the case of Sweden and England, where they think that Assange is.
Movement outraged to the lawyers of Assange, who yesterday published a letter dénonceant the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, of 39 years, proved to be disposed to answer by video-conference the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remind that Assange solicited and got the licence to go out from Sweden of the prosecutor of the case, that they compare with the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, leader of the security of Stalin.
"It seems to be a hunt, not a lawful persecution," reports the missive.
While the world searches him - and in Australia its mother defends the innocence of its son - Assange continues being in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Mondays he granted one from an indeterminate place interview to the manager of the magazine Time across Skype, a dialogue in which he asked for the resignation of the secretary of the State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to show that she was responsible to have give orders in graduate American whom they spy on to the UNO by violating the international treaties that the United States she signed, should resign," has he says.
Its opinion was insulted by the secretary of press yesterday of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "ridiculous and absurd" the request of resignation.
"I am sure in no way why the opinion of a type with a page web should interest us," it declared for CNN has.
Obama himself made responsible one high representative for the anti-terror struggle, Rusell Travers, for preventing new escapes of documents.
The trial of the spokesperson of the president Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange contrasts with the opinions which the politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who from January will chair the Committee of National security in the Lower House asked the Department of the State that he studies the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organisations "to confiscate his funds and to continue to every person who gives them contributions or assistance."
Even farther went Tom Flanagan, a Canadian presidential adviser Stephen Harper, who has to come back on his statements having said that Assange will have to "be assassinated."
"Obama should transform him into objective and employ a plane without crew or something similar."
A person who did not ask for excuses was Mike Huckabee, minister baptist, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"The one who is in the Government which filtered information is guilty of treason and all that is not an execution would be a too kind punishment," it declared for Fox terrier has.
Puigcercós searches peace in ERC with twinkles to the supporters of Carod
The republican leader will allow to the party a secret voting on his continuity.
Huguet offers a more plural executive and the end of the system of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve umpteenth internal uprising inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and the half of polls.
The president of the party is conscious due to the fact that his threat of resignation is not sufficient for the supporters of the ancient leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is so indistinct now that his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him headaches which he had with other lifeless currents.
It is for it that the leader of Esquerra will try to earn his new critics with twinkles which allow him to become hardened. up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to pronounce on the continuity secretly.
By ballots, not by raising the hand.
If carodistes wants to transport some vote of penalty to the president, they will be able it to make fright without any in retaliation.
In fact, the leader of ranks wants to avoid the picture of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews he maintained that he would not be considered ratified with the half more one of the polls, but he added, without mentioning percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would be good either.
The close persons in Carod demand to the president a little more that to put its position in disposition of the militance, a gesture which is not worth when Puigcercós controls the organ maxim between congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignation, they will try to agree with executive to a movement order until May.
For it, they hope to participate in the development of the document of strategical reorientation that direction will subject 18 to the voting of national advice.
Its intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for the promise of this one to program the congress for the autumn of 2011, what the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The leader of ERC confessed that the "polyphony" affects stability and that its objective is to make that once and for all the organisation is capable of washing its linen room in family.
In this line, the article which the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog results symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovaci ó thought that makes him that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" it's as if had been made.
And he listed five, of whom he underlines two.
The first, to "reword " executive so that he represents at least 90% militance, that is to say, to include new faces which come from the sector supporter of Carod.
Second can be the character of big news.
Huguet offers that ERC liquidates once and for all the assembly as mechanism of functioning.
So, he defends one re-forms statutes who allows the realisation of congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finish with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, a fixed idea of the team of Puigcercós was, which has already struggled in this sense in two last congresses.
In fact, convulses him conclave of 2008 made responsible direction for reviewing the model of assembly in a specific congress of re-form statutes.
This meeting remains incomplete, because the internal tide of last years did not recommend to approach this subject.
Now, without critical sectors in carriage, the instant could be good to take him back and to close it forever.

The message was disclosed after 42 republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation if the extension of the reductions of the taxes of the epoch of Bush and the financing of the government persist.
Such blockage, announced in a letter signed by 42 republican senators, could affect the vote of Law Dream Act and of other plans as ratification of the new STARTING treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned on the republican blockage of Law Dream Act and of other plans, the presidential spokesperson Robert Gibbs declared that he is intimate friend that once tax problem is resolved it will be possible to fix an agende for the rest of plans.

Nevertheless at least one of them, the senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he would vote against there and only a republican expressed his support for law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
It is for it that the supporters of Dream Act require the vote of several republicans if other democrats decide to vote against initiative.

With literature the finger on the wound is put
The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a promenade in which the participants made a display of narration
"Sex in the language, I understand him, but the finger on the wound? what does be hoped of me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela guest has open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle which celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was devoted to Sex in the language, her explained).
The finger on the wound" puts us in embarrassment," threw the writer slowly Argentinian to the public, most young people, who had met in the International Fair of the Book of GUADALAJARA (THREAD) to listen to this table softened by Marisol Shultz and in whom participated Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text devoted to Gonzalo Celorio whom Shultz defined afterwards as a big history, with Luisa in first person as protagonist who searches to know which is the "wound," she goes from a doctor to other one, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
Of the infectiologue she goes out persuaded: "patience is not my strong point, it is perhaps my wound."
At the end, afterwards one frustrated approaches with the trauma consultant who cut him breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explains him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst whom reveals mystery: "the wound is what is opened in reality, symbolism is the scar."
The protagonist should sigh relieved and concludes: "on the wound I only could know that it is who is opened in reality and that it does not exist," but persuaded due to the fact that pleasures and traps of the language must be very linked between them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played two with.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez displayed as a delightful narration as he called Praise to invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With keys of magical realism, he speaks about a famous charmer who touched clouds, made go back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damoiselle had lost, a narration which transfers to speak then America, big news which had from the beginning her own chroniclers and named to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticises excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervantès who invented us all writers) made fun of perjurers who appeared in stories introduced as real, but from an aitre way they would have never narrated that the history of America with an imagination which missed virtuousness even of."
Nevertheless, has it underlined, "the madmen and the liars have imagination the best" and here reality converges with lie, they do not know any more what part of narration belongs to a band or other one, where the literature of invention peaks.
It is indeed called the 'tradition of Cervantès'.
"It is thanks to his inheritance that they are what is narrated."
In its turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by invitation of THREAD with its round table owes Him on the wound.
The Cuban - Puerto-Rican has product of disputes of puts his on the big wound of social violence which its country crosses - and Latin America shares - fiddles and the sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poem the good songs contain a tacit commitment that am not really sure premeditated," her pointed out, having named that the reality of literature is communication and dimension of commitment which settles between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of this last.
The party is finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also underlined "it owes on the wound of the hired writer."
He considered that in the world which lived at high speed so in what concerns intellectual habits and control of conscience who turns to the advantage of dogmatisms, "behind every affirmation there is a baby not and behind every negation there is a baby yes."
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of reality, we must modify: and to modify means a lot of times to put down the finger on the wound and to disturb the persons who feel very convenient by thinking in caricature, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance and to disturb also in the powers which prefer the world in white and black," has he says, by inviting to recover sense to write.
Romano in the hunt of its first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he could attain decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in final, there is in more two different styles which are confronted, marked by their technicians, which find between them a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales, he had tops and bottoms in his career, but he could attain decisive series three times, even if until now he did not put in the thousand and it is for it that this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up finding consolation with sub-champion's medal, there remained a step behind the winning and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The santiste strategist arrived at his first final as entraineur in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when it held the reins of Morelia with whom he lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Fence 2003 he also arrived at decisive duel and lost once again with the total result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in Tournament Bicentenary 2010, once again against Diablos, Rubén endured a back once again, because his team made a match equate 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he got an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to get title and finally three of his players missed 11 metres and he endured jump in the result of 4-3.
Rubén lost two finales with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its rival in tournament, as a result he does not want to have the same fate, he tries to break loose from bewitching to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, even if he maintains that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be champion, I want to break no statistics, it is for a club, not for a passion which I have and as a result I will get title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the coxswain when they asked her whom would be her weak points in finales.
He remembers a lot the last final, which he assures that he learnt a lot, "the only lesson which we can keep it is that until the referee hisses the final, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because last time, with two penalties to pull we were already prepared for running and I think that it is a lesson, before the end of match it is not possible to celebrate."
He knows that this series could define itself by penalties, what does not worry it, because he entrusts in his players: "They never try to arrive at the series of penalties, they try to finish for the regular delay, but sometimes he remains us only prepare us, the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately destiny made us a bad turn, sometimes these are emotions or anxiety to hold title between our hands, hands he avoided us, it was of use for us as lesson for this final and we hope that they do not arrive any more in this situation."
Romano has opportunity now not to be any more a technician sub-champion and taste for the first time the glory given by titles.

In any form, the creature uses the arsénique as a way to live and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets without our voluntary atmosphere.
According to astrobiologistes, if these organisms use the arsénique in their metabolism, it proves that '"there is another form of life, second form of life, different to the one whom we know."
The space agency will announce the true range of discoveries in press conference of tomorrow, on Thursday.
In conference the géobiologie Pamela Conrad will participate, who studies the possibility of life on march; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who study Titan (the biggest satellite of Saturn), under perspective of that his chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.

He said that the bad state of streets and pavements affected because the tourists come there to go for a walk and they see riot and avoid close trade.
"The politicians do not know that a day means to close a firm and they do not know the destiny which is lost, elsewhere they did not do jobs for such a long time and without an adequate planning."
The hotelkeeper José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist has display the lack of prevention and maintenance on behalf of the City council.
"The municipe will have to take its responsibility and avoid that it passes once again, how to make it, therefore has foible of a preventive maintenance and to make corrective only," has he says.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of fact that it is a tourist zone they must to maintain it, but since inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the City council must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites which are neglected and incomplete, has he says, as for example Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city which has cleanness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," has he says.
"They not their paid the attention which is needed and this type of facts underlines something that is well-known for all, maintenance is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under secretary of Tourist Promotion, declared that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not correctly used and cast a bad picture.
He spoke about a series of places which have to put on online in group with the municipe and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, ordered and that it is delightful because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán gives many sites and historical places and culturaux that they should order first, to clean and to put us online to make them delightful to be possible him add to inventory that we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP asks for results the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, offered that the deputies take big responsibility to be an example for one better Sinaloa because of various provocations with which is confronted.
The sector of business of Mazatlán solicits a Working legislature worthy and free from agreements between parties and governmental Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and is confronted with one big problems.
Yesterday they installed the 60-è legislature formed by seven political force, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of the SECTION, three of the Party the New covenant, two PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of prudent approaches that the new integrant of the governmental Congress is a management clean and hired with the society and the different sectors which need a responsible legislative work and that the same models of mind of party or paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, offered that the deputies take big responsibility to be an example for one better Sinaloa because of various provocations with which is confronted.
"We hope that the deputies indeed exercise their right, free from agreements between parties because custom is that they make pacts to watch over their own interests and they are transformed into farce of carnival of the governments and of the leaders of parliamentary fractions."
It is for it that I ask that they certify the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that make the current Government advance.
"We will make sure that they do a worthy job and especially hired with the society and sectors because people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidentiality in crossed elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the big provocations of 40 popular representatives is that to grow and to add force by searching the economic growth of the State, because currently financial status is very complicated.
"The most important it is because they push economic growth, because they generate stimulations for the investment and facilities and it of a way will stimulate the generation of workstations."
As regards tourist activity, he asked that the new legislators give her the importance which she has in the governmental budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Tourism Governmental.
"I understood that it is the second Secretariat of the State with a more reduced budget and it is incongruous as important and generative economic activity of currencies and investment and which competes directly with the agro-industry."
Apart due to the fact that it is necessary to classify resources in tourist plans detonators which help to give sureté to the State and to update the Law of the Alcohol which the previous legislatures could not solve.
King magus is searched
Dolls, cars and bikes, between other toys, are wants it of children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, next day of the Wise men will be difficult to fulfil their phantasms, because their home is formed by no more and no less 12 persons and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspar will wear them toys and clothes which they want so much.
The family lives in an unassuming home of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live from day to day because their father has no stable job.
"Sometimes it is very difficult for us, because my spouse does not have work, but we sell tangerines and potatoes and in the afternoon I go out with 'plebs ' to be sold on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the babies.
Adelaida, of 4 years, wants a doll or a bike, and his sister Isabel, of 3 years, would like a doll Barbie.
In its turn, José Alfredo, of 10 years, desires for a long time to have one 'monster flat truck' and as his small brother Jesús, of 8 months, Cayetana suggests clothes of size for one year.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I said to him 'they will see, my son', because he was very expensive," remembers with sadness Cayetana.
For the bigger children, who was at the school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, of 11 years, puts size 12 on; Isaías, of 10 years, puts size 10 on, while Miguel, of 8 years, puts size eight on.
José Juan, of 14 years, needs one peer of shoe of sports, therefore one peer of size five and half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help to make reality the dream of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign king magus Is searched, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 presumed stopped drugs dealers
A dozen house searches was accomplished in Estrie, on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of a network of production and of sale of cannabis.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will face up various accusations.
House searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, predominantly in places which would have been of use for the production of drug.
"About 750 young plants of cannabis, four kilogrammes of haschich, of money and equipment which was of use for production were grabbed," pointed out Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Safety of the Quebec.
In all, eleven men and three women were stopped, among which both ruling heads presumed this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The stopped persons had to appear in the law courts of Sherbrooke in the hours according to their arrest.
They could face up accusations of production of cannabis, of possession with the intention of making the traffic, of conspiracy and service flight, between others.
These house searches took place following a long-drawn-out inquiry, which lasted very close to one year.
"It is the information accepted from the public who allowed us to undertake these arrests," specified Mr Ruel.
About 70 policemen of the regional module of inquiry of Estrie of the Safety of the Quebec, the Service of police of Sherbrooke and the State control of police Memphrémagog, took part in this police operation.
Underground migration will be able to continue without problem
The bill of the conservatives which, according to the government, should regulate the problem of boats charged with underground migrants, is obviously going to be beaten while three opposition parties informed on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I lean strongly on Charter."
"I stand with a party which created the granite under your feet," declared the liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, while he was encircled with deputies after the keeping of the weekly meeting of the caucus.
The Liberals pretend that the bill such as offered, who would allow to keep until one year every person coming from an identified ship as transporting underground immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of rights and freedom.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Giles Duceppe, also pointed out that he could not support bill, because he is taken in the bad target.
"We are against and it seems that all parties of opposition are against, then they will see what the government will make," declared Mr Duceppe.
The criticism of the NPD in immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected of the back of the hand critics wanting that its party is not rather firm concerning the underground immigrants.
"The neodemocrats agree so that measures against the conductors of illegal immigrants are taken and it is what we make by the intervention of another bill, C-35," pointed out Mrs Chow.
"We do not support the bill of the conservatives because it is taken to the refugees and imprisons the children during at least a year," explained Mrs Chow.
The minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of playing policy and of being unaware of the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians say in great numbers to the deputies that they do not tolerate this type of underground migration, these criminal operations which target Canada and that treat the country as a doormat."
"They expect that Canada takes to firm measures," the minister Kenney reacted.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, what would have been able to lead the country to elections happening its rejection.
A conservative however said to the Agency QMI that the government is going to ask for a vote so that every deputy who will oppose explains then in front of his voters.
New unit does not have unanimous support
In spite of the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to struggle against corruption and conspiracy by Jean Charest, many observers continue asking for the creation of a public investigating committee on subject.
The minister of the Public security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea does not date yesterday: Quebec would have consulted Department of Investigation of New York on this subject from last January.
The metropolis has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of Tuesday surprised it more of one.
It is necessary to say that during a meeting of permanent Council on the police services of the Quebec, on October 29th of this year, this measure was never discussed in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
It did not need it more so that the péquiste critic in public security, Stephane Bergeron, qualifies this announcement of "rabbit taken out from a hat" and of "solution knocked up on the corner of a table."
The minister Dutil as for him answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on possible future unit.
"You are going to see result when it is going to be announced, he contents himself with asserting."
"They are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the setting up of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest persists in not wanting to create this investigating committee, the more people think as you and me whom he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only means to have an investigating committee, it is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains as for shone Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and of gouvernance to the public Grande École of Public Management.
To go out of this dead end, he suggests therefore in Quebec giving a special mandate to the general controller so that he investigates conspiracy and corruption.
"It is necessary to be capable of enlarging the mandate of the general controller," he cuts.
He also thinks that Quebec could give to the controller the same powers as to a commissioner, allowing him so to make people testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only plan in the cardboards of the government Charest.
Quebec would also ask in Ottawa to change criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would emanate from the prosecutor of operation Hammer, which informed minister of Justice Jean-Mark Fournier that the case law is not explicit in this type of inquiries.
The federal minister of the Public security, Vic Toews, as for him confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, leans at present over some amendments linked to this file.
During operation Spring, 2001, which hit the groups of bikers, even if criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later made adopt Law on organised crime.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several watercourses reside under high surveillance because of strong rainfall which beat down on several regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide happened on Wednesday afternoon, in Shawinigan, in Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated in a preventive way.
In party, another sliding would have occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road subsided.
From Tuesday till Wednesday evening, strong rainfall beat down on several regions, that is from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
From 20 to 40 millimetres of rain one waited before Thursday evening, according to regions additional.
Sectors north of the river and in the valley of Outaouais were the most affected.
They could accept up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Properly to figure this rainfall up to the cast iron of the snow already collected in some sectors, is feared the flood of several watercourses.
Warnings of alert of inundation were issued on Wednesday evening by the Civil security of the Quebec for rivers Ouareau and the Black bass, in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, in Saint-Jérôme, in Laurentides, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, made as for them the object of vigils of inundation and resided under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, the strong rainfall drew away the flood of some lakes, in Saint - Julian, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken because of strong rains.
Ten residences must be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the flood of some lakes drew away the closing of several ways, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security resides on a foot of alert and watches situation nearly, pointed out Annik Bouchard, advisor in security.
The Centre of prediction of the floods of the Quebec issued from his part on Wednesday the warnings of strong floods for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Black bass, Batiscan and of the Wolf.
Dupont partly blamé
The animator of radio of Quebec Stephane Dupont suffered a partial back in front of the Canadian Council of the norms of radiotelevision (CCNR) for controversial purposes on casework and Haitian as well as on his rude language in waves.
CCNR judges that Mr Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that some purposes contained of "inexact information on casework, representations unduly negative of Haitian and of the rude language which is not suitable for programmes broadcast during day."
Council also concluded that a debate on the suicide, including the broadcasting of the name of two persons who had committed suicide, did not infringe codes on broadcasting.
CCNR had accepted several complaints about comments made during programmes broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was pronounced following a complaint of the common Forehead of the social persons assisted by the Quebec.
The group complained that sums named in the programme were inexact.
The animators have to introduce solid information rather than deceivers.
Concerning the suicide, the animator Stephane Dupont had thought that the suicide is coward's gesture.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the transported message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution in the problems of life.
"The majority Committee considers that implicated episodes by "Dupont midday" approached a delicate subject in an equitable and appropriate way."
No criticism was therefore kept in its place.
The last litigation concerned statements which followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean - René Dufort had then devoted themselves to a media one-to-one debate which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The animator of CHOI declared that he had given to help the Haitian because it was not possible to know with certainty that necessitous people would really accept the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not excessive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes a representation unduly negative of Haitian.
"I have already purged my suspension of three days thereupon."
"My file is virgin for one and a half year," declared the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee reports the broadcasting of rude language.
In every case, RADIODISTRIBUTOR CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond his obligation."
Consequences are trifling for the station which will have to, between others, announce these decisions once during peak listening times within three days.
A king of the kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely particular course.
The athlete who excels in "Sanda" (kung fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and punches Thai goes up on tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I began practicing martial arts as the kung fu and the kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve at the professionals'."
"In my case, I search battles a bit everywhere, since for those who do not like game on the present soil in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as agent of security and as made for the company UPS has just issued bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals in the amateur World championship of World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 till 30 October, in Édimbourg, in Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickboxing full contact and of boxing Thai, he explained."
"Currently, I get ready to go to China for World Cup of san shou."
"The combatants who ended among four first during the last World championship in every category were invited."
"I won the bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded tournament in the fifth rank, while I arrived third at Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting, it is that I advanced in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!"
The " san shou " or "Sanda" is a discipline native to China where punches and kicks, as well as projections on the soil, are allowed.
Duels take place originally on a deck and more seldom in a ring.
The most renowned pugilist coming from this form of battle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, admitted well in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has to keep only the single event in its career, he will answer the presence surely great tournament " King of Sanda ," Super Bowl of the kung fu.
"This competition is the most raising and the most prestigious in China, explained the nice fellow."
"It is a bit the equivalent of the Stadium Lumpinee (the biggest stadium of Thailand)."
"Ç' was a great experience."
Zemmal won the first battle, in semifinal of the category (80 kg), before losing in finale.
"The one who conquered me was a true pro, he analysed."
"There are four combatants by category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winning of semifinals confront one another in finale of their category."
"Then, the victors of every category make face to crown the single champion, the king of the kung fu."
450 millions in contracts without invitations to tender
Hydro-Quebec granted by mutual agreement 450 million dollars in contracts to business companies of engineering for hydroelectrical plan Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by business companies BPR, Dessau, SM group and Axor that got the most important, that of the management of plan, for a sum of 295 million peremptory dollars of offer.
This consortium called Energy management was constituted in 2004 in a concomitant way to be chosen by hydro-Quebec to entrust its responsibility to the deprived sector to manage this important hydroelectrical 5 thousand million dollar plan.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy consortium management took contract down profitable without there being public invitation to tender.
For the Party of Quebec, the appeal to consortiums of firms poses a serious ethical problem which risks eliminating competition and causing an increase in prices.
"It is the new way of making conspiracy and of slaughtering competition."
"That is people, instead of making this in a secret, supporting way make it of an opened way," declared yesterday the deputy péquiste Sylvain Simard in press conference.
Earlier in morning, Mr Simard raised question to the National Assembly because he tells he sees hardly how the interest of the public can be served in that way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, argued in afternoon, disclaiming vigorously that there is conspiracy as this contract.
"I begin having my trip," she cursed, supporting that PQ had been "dishonest" and "had missed essential."
She said that "it would be slightest of things" that PQ apologises.
The expression of consortiums is a common practice worldwide.
It is habitually about an alliance limited in the time which allows several firms for two or to regroup their respective expertises to answer an invitation to tender for a complex plan.
Eastmain plan includes a high level of complexity considering the largeness of jobs.
The construction site is under way and must be spread until 2012.
However, the contract was allocated without the free play of competition acting; there was negotiation.
Also, the expression of consortiums is not any more an exception in the Quebec, even for relatively simple plans.
As revealed him last week Duty, expression of consortiums in the sector of genius-advice makes the object of an inquiry to the government.
A quick flyover of the register of the firms of the Quebec allows to count more than 200 consortiums, among which some seem permanent.
So, the Dessau business company works in partnership with most its main rivals, among which CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-LAVALIN and others Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens, brings back to an one and the same legal entity, is Dessau.
As for the consortium Energy management, the minister Normandeau underlined that "the territory of the Bay James answers particular dynamics of work force and that hydro-Quebec answers it in a particular way since the seventies."
The big boss of the plan Eastmain, Réal Laporte, of the Power corporation of the Bay James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which made raise eyebrows on the fact that the contract of management of plan was granted by mutual agreement.
"If you go to invitation to tender and that there are few bidders, your prices are going to be more raised."
"You have two choices: or that you take people who are in this market and that you say: a satisfactory understanding and with a good price is going to be negotiated."
"But idea, it is that it is not the price which is important, it is the competence of people," asserted Mr Laporte.
This contract granted to the consortium Energy management is part of a long list of more than 50 000 $ contracts got by the Party of Quebec.
Contracts were granted by hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for plan Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After check, Duty counted 109 contracts of geniuses-advice granted between 2002 and March, 2010 to business companies or to their subsidiaries, notably of laboratories of soil.
SNC-LAVALIN made off 22 contracts, Génivar got from it 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting the participation in Energy management.
All contracts were negotiated.
They total 449 783 344 $, including the contract with Energy 295 131 564 $ management.
Sylvain Simard gave to understand that four business companies which compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM group and Axor) are "well-known to the liberal Party of the Quebec."
The minister Normandeau dropped that PQ is also linked to these business companies which "finance" it, before adding that it was rather about his leaders.
Barometre of responsible consumption - The "green" tag does not inspire confidence
More green, but frankly sceptical.
The consumer of Quebec little trusts in actors of the sustainable development, but also in equitable marks and in certifications écologisantes to guide his choices.
Worse, even if he baths in a media world where messages in favour of a more responsible consumption proliferate, he deplores a lack of credible information, deficiency which he qualifies even as brake in his commitment, points out the Barometre of responsible consumption, the first reading of which was delivered yesterday.
Even if they made augment the socially responsible consumption by said products in 2010, the natives of Quebec however seem to grant little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them tell they indeed do not believe the environmental commitment of firms just as the green advertising of companies, reveal the tool of measure worked out by the Observatory of the consumption responsible for the University Sherbrooke.
Other official report: the half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the equitable said products, but also the credibility of products and marks displayed as being ecoresponsible, points out the Barometre.
In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14,6% natives of Quebec.
The information in responsible consumption seems however primordial to stimulate this section of consumption enlivened currently by near the third of the consumers of Quebec.
Indeed, space and doubtful character of information would tranquilize the ardour of 46% of the consumers.
It is the second brake identified by the Barometre, after the higher price of these products.
Moreover, a third of the natives of Quebec claims to be so distrustful towards performances alleged by products or green services that they try to put in them between hands.
On another note, the consumers were near the half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed by mark of one or several products to answer their conviction.
At the level of 61%, they also favoured purchases to dealers of their district and the purchase of cultivated foodstuff in their region, points out the Barometre.
More green and responsible - the indication of responsible consumption attained 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Homosexual consumus of the Quebec wants to come as the king of recycling who tries to reduce his environmental footprint concerned about the protection of the animals.
But its social and ecological conscience however seems to stay outside its car, points the Barometre out: in 2010, barely 28% natives of Quebec pointed out having used the public transport or recommended the covoiturage to defend their green interests.
The walk and the bike were also supported by 39,1% participants in this large behaviour inquiry, which has just taken its first plate.
A loan of the State for redemption eXcentris
The government of the Quebec, which they asked to get involved financially in the redemption of the complex of cinema eXcentris by the Society Angus and the Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but in competition of a loan only.
The Society of development Angus and the Parallel, who hoped for a seven million dollar donation of the Ministry of Culture to buy back to Daniel Langlois the film complex eXcentris on the boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving again to him its full cinéphilique vocation, do not get what they claimed.
The government agrees to get involved in the file, but on its own conditions.
Rather than waited donation, government of the Quebec offers a loan sum of which would besides be less than initial waitings, that could constitute a viable solution on favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of sources coming from dispensaries of the State.
A foreground of action and a request of 12,8 millions had been already rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests had since summer saw again in fall.
A proposal and a plan of action were sent to the minister St-Pierre by the president of the Society of development of the cultural firms (SODEC), François Macerola, which pilots the file of eXcentris.
He forwarded him an ultimate report a dozen days ago.
Mais la la contre-proposition du l'évaluation d'armoire parvenue à la SODEC mardi.
The Parallel and Angus have until December 31st to answer it.
It seems however that the hypothesis of the donation of the State must really be moved aside.
Let us remind that the Association of the owners of cinema and of drive-in cinemas of the Quebec opposed to a direct investment of the State to support redemption of eXcentris, deducing that the Ministry of Culture has not to finance property plans, what it did not make for other cinema halls.
But several dealers of middle claimed one on the contrary economic aid substantial.
Daniel Langlois, the master of the house, during ten years carried at the end of arm the art-house cinema in his places of the complex having financed himself his building, what could justify an infringement on behalf of the Council of treasure.
The lack of rooms for the independent films is blatant in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to secure the loyalty of its customers.
The Angus society and the Parallel, with at the head Christian Yaccarini, pilot, for their part, a fund-raising campaign in the private, hoping to gather 700 000 $ to grow to the wheel of the acquisition.
Since spring, 2009, the only one of three screens, The Parallel, continues broadcasting films in eXcentris.
The purpose of the future purchasers is to open again three rooms on February 27th of this year by casting the very nice film of Xavier Beauvois Des men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Of Duty and they are unaware of what he and his group think of proposals of fall which are made to them.
The veil raised on complexé Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks bring out in the open what the United States consider to be the inferiority complex of the Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray at once the feeling of superiority of these last towards Canada.
So, the American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter has no Canadian-American relations in leaving mind to vote and thinks that the visit of the president Obama helped the conservative government to make adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, displayed over the public yesterday, give more crispy details than substantial contents to put on under the tooth.
A cable dated from September 22nd, 2008, am in the countryside electoral federal, relates to what extent the United States are not part of stakes discussed by the political leaders.
In the big astonishment of the American ambassador posts it in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives some explanation of this situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex conditions perhaps the Canadian political leaders to speak about internal stakes of the daily rather than to make carry this election on the United States (as during the campaign on the free trade of 1988) ," he writes.
The United States are therefore, he concludes, "proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing to speak about it."
The ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" as both countries have an intense political and economic relation.
"Logically, he estimates, the capacity of a candidate, of a party and some more than a leader of party to manage this essential relation should be a factor-key which the voters have in mind leaving vote."
The other expression of this important feeling is read in the cable sent on January 22nd, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires to Ottawa, preparing the president Barack Obama for its first visit in Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to assure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will show its first deficit besides decade because of a plan of revival from 30 to 40 thousand millions of dollars," writes Mr Breese.
Nowhere he is mentioned only the government had to prorogue the Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overturned by the alliance and that opposition parties returned its conditional survival in the quality of the offered plan of revival.
Another communication, dated of January, 2008 and signed by the ambassador Wilkins, tells Washington of the more and more negative picture that dramatic series broadcast in CBC return the United States.
The ambassador gets worried about programmes to Edge, Little Mosque one the Meadow, Intelligence and H2O, in which they notice not very subtle references to Maher Arar, to "No-Fly-List" or else to kidnapping for muscular cross-examinations of the CIA.
Another cable relates that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners of Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "case by case ."
At the end of meeting, it is written, "he delayed a paper to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to see again the file."
Let us note finally that minds warm up concerning the site WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an ancient adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of CBC that the representative for this massive escape should be "assassinated ."
He echoed under Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A worldwide plan to renovate lighting
The UNO offered to Cancún a plan of renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries yesterday with a view to getting a reduction of gas with greenhouse effect (GES) which corresponds almost to the third of the additional reduction which it is necessary to accomplish to stabilise planetary climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the wake of the big concrete plans which the UNO hopes to make adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of restrictive commitments of reduction by industrial countries.
According to registered plan yesterday, if the aglow bulbs which still monopolise from 50 to 70% markets were replaced with fluocompactes bulbs or, better, with bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the basics of 1,8 thousand million tons (Gt) of GES issued on the planet to light the human beings would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% worldwide programmes.
It is the equivalent of 70% of programmes planetary fleets of cars.
In Copenhagen, last year, the big broadcasting countries, as the United States, China, Europe and others, which Canada, got involved in voluntary plans of reduction which should get the total programmes of GES of 53 Gt in 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to subtract from this balance sheet another 5 Gt to succeed in stabilising before 2020 the increase in climate to 2 centigrade degrees to avoid that it becomes out of control.
In the aglow bulbs, 95% energies the rest recedes in form of heat and, that is 5%, produces light.
With fluocompactes bulbs, the expense of energy is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs in DEL, they reduce this need of energy of two times still.
Fluocompactes bulbs lasted on average from 6000 till 10 000 o'clock.
The new bulbs in DEL, as those whom threw the manufacturer Philips this week - this society besides participated in the study of the UNO - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and use 80% less energy than an aglow bulb, what gives an idea of possible economy with a plan of replacement which would apply to 100 countries.
These very new bulbs can also work with rheostats besides issuing little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
Several specialists showed reservations towards fluocompactes bulbs since they contain some mercury and that it is necessary to eliminate them as dangerous waste, what is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers set up left luggage offices.
But, points out the report, the main source of programme of mercury on the planet is not the fluocompacte bulb, but rather thermal power stations in the coal, which issue a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in aglow bulbs.
In the United States only, these power stations issue 25 000 tons of mercury per year.
The report itemises earnings which would make every country thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would spare so a thousand million dollars a year in purchases of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is the equivalent of 3,5 thermal power stations the building of which would cost him 2,5 thousand millions.
The Ivory Coast waits in nervousness for the announcement of electoral results
The general secretary of the UNO, Ban Ki-moon, claimed publication "without delay" of results of presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiration of prescribed deadlines.
"The general secretary underlines necessity for the independent electoral committee to finish his job and to announce interim results without more than delay, underlined a spokesperson of the leader of the UNO."
"He asks all parts of the Ivory Coast and institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative up to the announcement of interim results."
In spite of pressures exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral committee let through the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing results, three days after the polls of Sunday.
About forty minutes before expiry of the deadline, the president of the CIS had maintained on television that the committee "continued working" to announce results.
Calls increased on Wednesday in the world so that the CIS proclaims finally the name of the victor of the second turn Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara enters sitting.
But the Gbagbo camp counts on cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" polls in the north, held by the ex-rebellion of new Force (FN) since the blow of State missed of September, 2002.
Pascal Affi N' Guessan, manager of campaign of the president of the Ivory Coast, maintained that the maneuvers of threat of the voters practiced by FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
All election could be cancelled if complaints deposited by Gbagbo are kept by the Constitutional Council.
And the adversaries of Gbagbo think that most High Court of Justice of the country is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N' Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North which denies any link with the ex-rebels, judged "unacceptable" delay in the announcement of results and asked in Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go to the point of demanding victory.
Its allies maintain that Gbagbo blocks the publication of results because he knows that he lost and that to lodge a complaint in front of the Constitutional Council, having prevented the electoral committee from broadcasting results, would be illegal.
The second turn of presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to crown the process of reunification and of reconciliation of a country remained split into two during years.
The United Nations informed on Wednesday the political class of the Ivory Coast that she could be kept responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended 32% at the head of the first lap, October 31st, with 38% of votes against in Alassane Ouattara, which accepted the public support of the former president Henry Konan Bédié (25% in the first lap).
The unemployment rate remained stable in France in the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the sense of the International Labour Office (BIT) remained stable in 9,3% in metropolis (9,7% by counting overseas departments), show corrected data the seasonal variations interim (CV) published on Thursday by the French national institute of statistics and economic studies.
The number of unemployed persons settles in 2,631 millions in metropolis.
The data of the second quarter were confirmed in 9,3% workforce in metropolis and 9,7% with DOM.
Over one year, the unemployment rate is displayed up 0,1 point.
More widely, 3,4 million persons in underground France did not work on the third quarter but wanted to work, that they are or not available in two weeks to work and that they search a job or not.
The situation of the young gifts on labour market still degraded, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, carried to 24,2% in metropolis (+ 0,9 point over three months, +0,5 over one year) and 25% by including DOM.
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people from 15 to 24 years old were unemployed in the sense of BIT.
The seniors knew for their part a slight increase of the unemployment, in 6,4% in metropolis (+0,2 over three months as well as over one year), that is 482 000 50-year-old persons or more, and 6,6% with DOM.
Only 25-49 years benefited from a stability of unemployment in the third quarter, in 8,3% in metropolis (-0,1 over three months, +0,1 over one year) and 8,8% in all France.
The French national institute of statistics and economic studies does not publish monthly unemployment rate anymore since 2006, after a debate on its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the agency of statistics of the European Union, continues on the other hand making it and announced on Tuesday a 9,8% rate for France (DOM INCLUDING) in October after 9,9% in September.
Alexander Guérini interviewed under caution and put in detention
Alexander Guérini, 53 years old, running firms of treatment of waste and brother of the president PS of the general advice of the Bouches-du-Rhône, was interviewed under caution and committed to prison at home of stopping of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an inquiry into fraudulent supposed public works contracts.
Alexander Guérini was interviewed under caution for misuse of company property, misappropriation of funds and misappropriation of public property, concealment, active corruption, influence peddling and detention of ammunition, points out his lawyer.
"Alexander Guérini is combative and wants to explain all questions which the magistrate is going to ask him, and not fantasies."
"It is easy to follow it for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it is something else to prove them," had declared to the AFP its lawyer, Florence Rault, before the audition of its client.
Mr Guérini, brother of the man strong in PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to get a note to the judge before his audition to explain.
One of his fellows, Philippe Rapezzi, was also interviewed under caution on Wednesday evening and committed to prison.
According to his lawyer, Miss Lucien Simon, his client has never made something else than to make work discharges which he had to manage.
As for the attribution of markets or for funds linked to their functioning, he has never known it, said Miss Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, ex-managing director of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was interviewed under caution on Wednesday for misuse of public money and complicity, and left free under legal restrictions with ban to meet the protagonists of the file.
"My client could give explanation of the facts reproaches for that to him one."
"The magistrate instructor took into account it by not depriving him of freedom," said his lawyer, Miss Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been interviewed under caution and been released during the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with investment under legal restrictions for two of them, pointed out the additional prosecutor of the Republic Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, assistant general manager in the cleanness of Marseilles Provence Métropole (MPM), is followed for "influence peddling and passive corruption."
Two civil servants of the agglomeration of Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are interviewed under caution to the one for "subtraction and misappropriation of public property by a person charged with a mission of public service," other one for "complicity of misuse of public money."
Finally the companion of Alexander Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was interviewed under caution for "concealment of misuse of company property."
Among the persons who were confronted with Mr Guérini represent Stephane Brunengo-Girard, committed to prison recently in a parallel affair of fraudulent public works contracts touching in Corsica.
The investigating officers suspect its societies of having served for whitening some money of the organised crime.
The investigation is led as part of several judicial inquiries opened against X in April, 2009 following anonymous mails, for supposed fraud in the signing of public works contracts, especially in the course of study of waste.
From source close to the inquiry, investigations notably concentrate on the conditions of attribution and functioning of a discharge of Ciotat, which gathers the waste of Aubagne as well as of some cities of the metropolitan district of Marseilles (MPM).
Affair Clotilda Reiss: the Élysée Palace exaggerated the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July, 2009 till May, 2010, the fate of Clotilda Reiss, the young French seeker stopped in Iran for "spying," held opinion in breath in France, put alarmed diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
The whole under the attentive look of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents got by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World reveal some underwear of this crisis.
They describe how the Élysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going to the point of giving them advice for the treatment of their own crises of' "hostages" in Iran (the small group of hikers).
They show how the French representatives tried to persuade Washington where the liberalisation of the young Frenchwoman had had as counterpart no releasing of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian kept in France and searched by American justice for traffic of materials in aid of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put under a believed light the way the French presidency tried to manipulate media to accredit idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the liberalisation of Clotilda Reiss.
In reality, he was nothing.
A diplomatic telegramme written on August 12th, 2009 in Paris is called "Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases of hostages."
The adviser of the Élysée Palace for strategical business, François Richier, accompanied with the manager of Quai d'Orsay for the North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, discuss with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain him French method.
They recommend to the Americans to make it so much to repatriate their own discreet nationals of force in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "beat continuously" in media words " fundamental human rights ," "innocence," " immediate liberalisation ."
He is needed to abash the Iranian regime, sensitive to the picture.
"Make it especially since the Iranians ask you not to make it."
Because, crossed the tries of debates by discreet channels, "the silence no règlera nothing," the Iranians are "chief in delaying labourers."
Mr Richier adds that foreigners' arrest is "a familiar Iranian tactics: the hostage-taking for political blackmail."
He announces that the liberalisation of prison of Clotilda Reiss (who will intervene on August 16th, day when it takes refuge to the embassy of France) "will require the remittance to the Iranians of a broad amount of money" (230 000 euro of deposit).
And he informs that the Élysée Palace anticipates other crises of hostages, phenomenon which "is going to deteriorate."
The Iranians could "in the near future stop other one of about 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," he says.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilda Reiss went out of prison for twelve days, but rest blocked in Iran.
An information is broadcast: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States claim for a bootleg of sensitive electronic equipment towards Iran, is released in Paris, on decision of a judge.
The American embassy, as many observers, wonders about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which stalks Iranian underground networks of acquisition of equipment intended for the nuclear programme, the widening of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Did France accept a bargaining?
The liberalisation of the Iranian counters that of the Frenchwoman?
During a new maintenance with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Élysée Palace, he says, "was not only completely taken suddenly by the decision of the judge," but tried to oppose to it.
"There were lively exchanges between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (at that time Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot come back on decision" judicial notices.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains put under the '"narrow" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The adviser of the Élysée Palace dials a number of telephone, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilda Reiss in Iran, the Élysée Palace does not handle its efforts carefully, by means of press releases and of "escapes" organised in media, to make believe that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays an "important " and "influential" role of "mediator."
The Americans notice this activity not without irony, and note that manipulation carries its fruits since several articles of press reverberate French official version.
A telegramme dated from August 25th, 2009 recalls "the media 'blitz ' of the French officials."
On what is based so much "thankfulness" expressed towards Mr Assad, asks the embassy in Paris.
"In spite of their statements full of commendations, the French officials admit behind closed doors that they have only one vague notion of what the Syrians indeed made."
The document leans then over the reasons which pushed the Élysée Palace to be poured into this invention.
The intense effort of communication "aims at validating the policy of Sarkozy of opening in Syria," he analyses.
A policy thrown in 2008, which "had then been received, by many critical voices in France and abroad, as premature and unearned."
By "by exaggerated the Syrian role," Paris tries "to show in Syria which commendations she can earn by playing a constructive role in the region."
L'évaluation de L'objectif aussi "de semer des graines de discorde entre la Syrie et l'Iran."
The American embassy knows it about good source.
On August 11th, François Richier entrusted him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians made whatever it is."
"But we nevertheless thanked them."
"It should seed confusion at least at the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss rentre demi-cadratin la France le 16 2010 mai.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts it to the Élysée Palace.
In a press release, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, of Senegal, and of Syria, for their "active role in favour of the liberalisation of our compatriot."
No online games for the young Koreans crossed midnight
The South Korean government is going to adopt a said law "of Cinderella" which will forbid to the teenagers to play online games after midnight by blocking their access, pointed out governmental representatives.
A bill is going to be put before Parliament in December to ask the societies of online games to block the access to these games after midnight, to the young people of less than 16 years old, pointed out representatives of Ministries of Culture and of family.
"Many children play these games all night and have then difficulties in studying to the school and in having a normal life during day."
"We think that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," declared to the AFP JO RIN, the ministerial representative loads with it bill.
Online games will be again accessible at 6 am.
Societies will be one year old to get ready for the application of law, he specified.
The government also plans to ask the societies to limit the daily access time to these games for the young people for whom the parents apply for it, added the representative.
He is going also to put in disposition of people who claim him of free software which allows to limit the time crossed on Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most "linked " and newspapers bring back regularly news items linked to an intensive usage of Internet.
The country is also the outright champion of the worldwide competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea had won four gold medals to the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World championship 2018-2022: Fifa indicates the organising countries
In full storm because of suspicion of corruption, the executive committee of Fifa indicates on Thursday the organising countries of World Cups 2018 and on 2022, an eminently political choice where struggles of influence and lobbying risk overtaking technical criteria.
A thing is sure, the edition 2018 of competition queen of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Pays-Bas-Belgique).
That of 2022 will be much more exotic, the hoping international Federation to win new territories (Qatar, Australia), after the first one on the Africain continent in 2010, or to follow her establishment in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities part of delegations (David Cameron, the prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of the Qatar, the heads of Belgian government and Dutch, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of economic and political stakes of a world championship.
Negotiations behind the scenes risk therefore lasting until last minute.
For the rest, difficult to establish a hierarchy between the candidates.
According to the report of valuation of Fifa, the English, Spanish-Portuguese files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their rivals.
But these considerations will not weigh very heavy for 22 members of the executive committee at a time of the vote.
Sunday Times, at the origin of revelations having led to suspension for corruption of two members of THIS (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could so have ruined chances of the country, cradle of football which received the world championship only only once, in 1966.
BBC delayed a layer, on Monday, by broadcasting a documentary which pins three influential members of the IT, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Of what to dissatisfy Fifa and to put in embarrassment the English representatives, who launched into an intense lobbying these last weeks with David Cameron in first line.
The head of government hopes to reissue the blow achieved by his precursor Tony Blair, who had got in 2005 for London the organisation of JO-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore the coat of arms of England to the IT?
Nothing is less sure because the duet Spain-Portugal does not miss its culture trumps with its already ready stadiums, its expertise (world championship 82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and football.
But the absolute economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give a shower to their ambition.
The possible retaliation against the Englishmen and doubts on the solvency of Spain and of Portugal are only augmenting the quotation of Russia, become a weighty outsider in spite of the lacunas of its file (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But the prime minister Vladimir Putin decided not to perform displacement in Zurich and reported a "unfair competition in the preparation of vote," hinting at trouble veiled from the accusations of the English press against the members of the IT.
"They are covered with mud, they try to compromise them," threw Mr Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strong in the experience of 1994, appear as the logical favourites.
First worldwide economic power, seat of the main sponsors of Fifa, the country seems to have a length beforehand on Japan and South Korea, who built separately a very nice plan.
But these new candidacies appear premature for two countries having co-organised test in 2002.
Other threat: the conferment of the world championship 2026 in patterned, passionately desired by Fifa, who would indeed return Asiatic chances obsolete for 2022.
With the Qatar, which took out big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would follow the expansion towards new lands, but these two countries introduce more risks than certainties.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also suffer as a result of weakness of right TV paid off (because of time difference) by the European countries, the nerve of war for Fifa.
Second mandate: obviousness
From Gaulle had really hesitated.
Mitterrand had made believe that he hesitated.
Valéry Giscard d' Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no slightest hesitancy.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
A mandate in the Élysée Palace calls other one.
Therefore the current head of state will be candidate in 2012.
But obviousness does not make good household with the part of mystery tied to presidential function.
Then it is necessary to make as though doubt always existed.
In a sense as in other one.
In 2006, even without believing in it, the friends of Jacques Chirac pretended that a third mandate was not excluded.
November 15th, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of year 2011."
That he recalls in front of parliamentarians UMP, on Tuesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of " two mandates " therefore seeded a little of agitation.
Etait-ce l'annonce officielle de sa la candidature ?
They were far there.
The president was only reminding that the constitutional revision of 2008 limited to two the number of five-year terms.
He made an official report, an announcement.
It is not the first time when he recalls the presidential election, on the tone of humour, during such meetings.
"In the worst, or at best, you still have it for seven and a half years with me," he had thrown them in July, 2009.
Rebelote in May, 2010: "Do not think that I do not think about stage according to."
The purposes of the day before yesterday do not make him more candidate than the day before; they return him not less.
If they provoke comments, it is for a double reason.
The acceleration of running in the candidacy in PS, on one hand.
But this is not the entrance in lists of Ségolène Royal who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to come to light.
It is on the contrary because its candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many people in PS claim a cleaned up of battle more precocious than envisaged.
Bad opinion polls, on the other hand.
For the first time the voters of right would prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L' express).
"We have a candidate and there is not debate in UMP thereupon," the circle of the Prime minister immediately and carefully reacted.
"If he believes possible defeat, he will not be candidate," entrusts Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will believe he could always win," corrects Alain Juppé, relinquished in obviousness.
Euro: BCE forced to support its purchases of State titles
The last meeting of the Council of the governors of the European central Bank (BCE) of the year had to be a chance to specify the modalities of exit from crisis or, at least, to announce the stopping of a good many of the not conventional operations of monetary policy which owe if achèver at the end of the year.
Crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the institute of programme of Frankfurt will not be able undoubtedly to take the liberty of being also peremptory at the risk of aggravating a situation more than tense today on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be raised all the more.
Yesterday, on the occasion of press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, so greeted the active role played by BCE in favour of the resolution of the crisis of the debts of States in Europe.
She did not like to say if she thought that the central bank had to make more, by augmenting for example its programme of purchase of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflexion for my European (...) partners."
The day before, in Brussels, during his audition by the committee of the economic and monetary Business of the European Parliament, the president of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not prove to be more talkative as for his intentions, to be contenting himself with pointing out that the programme of purchase of State titles on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see on what we will decide" during the meeting of this Thursday.
The only certainty: BCE is going to keep its main unchanged guiding rate in 1%, its lowest historical level since May, 2009.
In facts, the purchases of obligations of the Treasury by BCE doubled last week, about 1,35 thousand million euro.
And, according to operators' inquisitiveness of market, she would have performed new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the eurosystem bought for 67 thousand million euro since May, 2010.
Among the operators of market, anticipations of a chase of purchases make no doubt (see page 29).
The economists either do not wait for notable change of cape.
If the operations of loans in more than three months have already disappeared from the armory of BCE, this last still undertakes limitless benefits of liquid assets according to generous conditions and for length spreading out from week to three months.
The economists expect today that this device is extended some months.
"I cannot imagine that she changes her programme in an important way."
"Otherwise it would be take the risk of causing new short-term tensions," considers Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit announced in the course of the first quarter 2011 seems more probable," Norbert Bräms anticipates for his/her part, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its interventions on the market of the national debt, "BCE should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to enliven an apathetic market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the importance of exhibitions of the European banks in the markets of sovereign debts of the euro area, the institute of programme does not have other choices than to support its presence on the market.
"It is necessary to him to take the place at all costs of the lack of investors on the market and to act of such kind to prevent a fad of outputs paid by the most fragile States," manifested an important bond administrator yesterday.
Because if rates of interest fly off, States will be embarrassed all the more to reduce their debt, otherwise to stabilise it.
The maintenance of the euro is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the round back
After the beginning of the week worrying for Italy, situation a bit relaxed, yesterday, with the low tide of rates 10-year-old bondholders.
A return to precarious peace.
At the end of meeting with the minister of Economy, the presidents of region told they had heard Giulio Tremonti to qualify situation of' "indecipherable" and to expect "unforeseen" weekend, what the person concerned then denied.
On Tuesday anyway, the distance with the German long rates had attained the record of 210 basic points and the price of the contracts of cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) had flown off to 263 points, drawing some panic away in Rome.
In Council of ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain, the distance with the German rates was superior to 400 basic points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, declared itself "strongly preoccupied" by "the turbulence of markets" and by the possible contagion from Ireland.
"Good news is that Italy, third economy of the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist in Hudson Institute.
Clearly, his problem is the absence of growth and the atony of tax returns which goes with, making run to the State risks it not to can any more cover its needs of financing.
The last predictions of Brussels were a cold shower for the government.
One waits from now on in 1,1% in 2011 and in 1,4% in 2012 for the Italian growth while the budget in the course of examination to the Senate banks on upon respectively 1,3% and 2%.
In these conditions, calculate the European Commission, public deficit will still represent 3,5% 4,3% GDPS next year (against 3,9% envisaged by the government) and in 2012 (instead of 2,7%).
Where from the rumour of a new supplementary finance bill which could be set up after holidays, for a 7 thousand million euro sum.
"If necessary, new measures of austerity will owe beings catches," estimates the commissioner at economic business, Olli Rehn.
At present, Italy accepts the support of the international institutions.
"The fundamental of its economy are in order and his count is good, we repeat it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator to the International Monetary Fund charges with it of Italy to the IMF.
"There is not problem for the time being, either on the court or on long term, because in spite of his important debt (119,2% GDPS in 2011, EDITOR'S NOTES), efforts of stabilisation asked in Italy are lesser than those asked other countries," notices Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question of political instability stays.
On December 14th, Silvio Berlusconi will confront a vote of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, following what preliminary elections could be organised at the end of March.
A period not very advantageous for the decision-making in the event of crisis serious would open then.
The Europeans reflect anticrisis in the strengthening of devices
Christine Lagarde has still beaten him as part of a press conference in Paris yesterday: "The Europeans, I think that he has been still shown on Sunday during the day and at night, support of course, determined, urged to defend their currency and their monetary zone."
Although very relating, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European State obligations brought some water in the mill of governments and BCE.
But it is not possible to speak about the beginning of normalisation yet.
The agency of Standard notation and Poor' s announced that she could degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, target most aimed today by speculation.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and of political visibility, which notably influences the banking systems," estimate the economists of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "the political time is slower than the time of markets."
Aware of this gap and of danger which he conceals, the European countries intensify debates to reinforce devices anticrisis already existent.
The informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and, more widely, with their peers of G20 are going well.
And it within sight also meetings of the Eurogroup and of the Ecoend of the beginning of next week.
BCE meets today.
In the menu, the fate of not conventional measures of support of the countries of the euro area in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Fund of financial stability (FESF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, began on Tuesday in Singapore a turn of Asia to inform the Far Eastern investors of the developments of crisis in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, he indeed prepares the ground.
The first programmes of titles of FESF are envisaged next month.
Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted to the agency Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase of funds mobilised by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
The countries which are in first line, Portugal and Spain, as for them, get ready to adopt structural reforms, notably in organisation of labour market.
Reforms which are added to the measures of austerity with effect more brought closer.
Lisbon and Madrid want to borrow a way different from those of Greece and of Ireland.
One and the other want of every price to avoid asking for an international help before setting up their own budgetary correctives and deciding on necessary structural reforms to give again confidence permanently.
The European backers, finally, discuss on available options to speed up the process of normalisation of the markets of sovereign obligations.
Passing through Paris, on November 24th, Axel Weber had idea first advanced that if 750 thousand million euro mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to delay the hand in the wallet.
The economists of Key Barclays, a leading actor of the market of European sovereign debt, judge that an extra money about 100 thousand million euro would be enough, "preferably " in the form of direct injection of liquid assets.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Mechanism of financial stabilisation endowed, this day, with 60 thousand million euro.
An advice with all chances to be attentively examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the conditions of market got worse.
Snow and glaze: 24 departments in orange alertness
Snow-covered episodes still procreate traffic problems, notably on secondary network in Brittany, and risk unsettling some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are from now on in orange alertness because of risk of snow and of glaze.
The Evre, the Eure-et-Loir, Two - Wean Vienna and, was added to 20 departments already in orange alertness, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later at night.

One going from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, waits for the concerned departments, and from 1 to 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm for the Paris region for layers of snow.
The concerned departments are those of the Charente, Charente - Maritime, Coasts of Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, of the Poitou and those of regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow-covered episodes are a suffisament notables to procreate traffic problems and to unsettle some economic activities, tells Weather forecast France.
In the Coasts of Armor, several departmental were forbidden to the heavyweights of more than 7,5 tons, among which axles Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The circulation on secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to the policemen who recommend to take its vehicle only in case of necessity and the circulation of some coaches TER was suspended for day.
The school transport was forbidden for Thursday in Picardy.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrain the circulation of heavyweights.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to most great caution on roads and to adapt their behaviour consequently."
The General management of civil aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights on the Parisian airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly because of snowfalls to come.
DGAC recommends to the air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, the airport of Gatwick, in the south of London, and that of Edimbourg, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Big Underground Paris: first financial draughts
Since the time when the debate around the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, thousand millions pleuvent.
In debate at least.
They recall especially 23 thousand millions for the Big underground Paris which the Society of Big Paris must construct.
To start this SGP, the State announced a 4 thousand million euro capital endowment.
In the theoretical diagramme, it is this sum which will then allow to SGP to borrow on markets a part of the financing of its double curl.
Today, they arrive finally at the first addenda there.
The corrected finance act on 2010, examined in committee of finances of the National Assembly this morning, contains devices envisaged to find the beginning of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase of the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first one, as it is read in the text of bill, article 15, is "to the advantage of the state-owned company Society of Big Paris."
She is estimated: "The product of this tax is 117 million euro a year."
The second is a redevelopment of a tax on the offices which already exists "to update it, to augment by it the product and to appoint this increase to the Society of Big Paris."
It would bring back how much?
Mystery.
It is not estimated in the text.
They are far from 4 thousand millions.
"He is added that these tax resources are added to 4 thousand million euro of the capital endowment which will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Society of Big Paris according to plan," it is possible to read in the preamble.
In SGP, this shocking system is not found.
"As soon as one created by recipes (both taxes, editor's notes), it is possible to cover studies over three years then to knock in 4 thousand millions afterwards, as it is explained there."
"It will be registered in the budget and drawn progressively."
SGP thinks that 4 thousand millions will begin being registered in 2013 for the budget 2014.
This device, in which 4 promised thousand millions still belong to the absent subscribers, risks causing an a bit agitated parliamentary debate.
First hearing on December 7th.
Les pirates informatiques vengeurs et espions demi-cadratin la diligence
Affair WikiLeaks has a double value.
On the one hand, she shows itself a visible scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal only in front of the hypocrisy which governs reports between States, citizens and press.
Of other one, she announces deep changes at international level, and prerepresent a future dominated by decline.
But let's go about things by order.
The first aspect from WikiLeaks, it is confirmation due to the fact that every file constituted by a secret service (of whatever nation it is) is exclusively composed of press cutting.
The "extraordinary" American revelations on Berlusconi's sexual habits are only bringing back what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi is possessing), and the sinistrement grotesque profile of Khadafi was for a long time for the artists of cabaret material with sketch.
The rule according to which the secret files must be composed only of already known news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookshop dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that every work repeats (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or Roses-crosses) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And it not only because the author of occult texts wants to do unpublished researches (neither nor knows where to search news on the nonexistent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only in what they know already, and who re-confirms what they had already learnt.
It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Idem for the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the leader of secret services (otherwise he could be, that I know, editor at Liberalisation), who keeps as truth only what he admits.
Information top-secret on Berlusconi whom the American embassy of Rome sent to the State department was the same that those whom Newsweek published last week.
Then why did revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person knows already, to know that embassies, at least since the end of World War II, and since the State leaders can phone or take a plane to meet to have dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, except for some small exercises of representation, were transformed into centres of spying.
Any spectator of films of inquiry knows it very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that they pretend to be unaware of him.
However, fact to repeat it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves for putting American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, idea that any hacker could pick up the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world hits not negligible the prestige of the State department.
Also the scandal does not put so in crisis the victims as the "hangmen."
But let us come from it to the deep nature of what arrived.
Formerly, at the time of Orwell, it was possible to conceive any power as Big Brother who controlled every gesture of its subjects.
Orwellienne prophecy had completely proved to be since, being able to control every movement thanks to the telephone, every performed transaction, the visited hotel, the motorway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the complete victim of the eye of power.
But when they show, just like that they arrive now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot avoid the control of a hacker, the report of control ceases being unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected representative as avenger of the citizen - is possible know all secrets of power.
How a power more with the possibility of keeping his own secrets can he hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel has said it already, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret will be able never to be revealed); it is true, also, that every knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or from Merkel is really an empty secret of secret, because recovering from the public domain; but to reveal, as made it WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets mean take from it away any power.
WikiLeaks harmed Sarkozy or in Merkel, but made a big surplus to Clinton and to Obama.
What will be consequences of this wound inflicted on a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in future, States will be able to put any more online no reserved information - it would return to publish it on a poster glued together on the corner of the street.
But he is also obvious as with current technologies, it is vain to hope he be able to maintain confidential reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state moved by air and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will be able to be maintained in future the reserved and private reports?
I know well that, at the moment, my prediction raises science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who move in a discreet way in stagecoaches in the uncontrollable routes, by being bearing only of memorised messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
Information will be kept in unique copy in locked drawers: at the bottom, the try of spying of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had opportunity to write that technology advances now in crab, that is to say backwards.
A century after wireless telegraph revolutionised communications, Internet restored one telegraph on (telephone) threads.
The (analogical) videotapes had allowed to the researchers in cinema to explore a film step by step, leaving forward and behind and by baring all secrets of assemblage, while now CD (numericals) allow only to jump of chapter in chapter, that is to say by macroportions.
With the high-speed trains, they go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by air, and displacements which he includes, three hours and a half are needed.
It is not therefore extraordinary that policy and techniques of communications return to horse-drawn carriages there.
A last observation.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was hatched in the secret of embassies.
Currently, it is the embassies which ask for confidential information the press.
Climate: how France fiddles with its promises of financings
One year after the Agreement of Copenhagen, it is time to examine the respect for the promises of financings fast released (said financings fast starting or precocious) accomplished by the developed countries.
And bidouillages French wholesale trades are revealed.
In the agreement of Copenhagen, the developed countries promised to give 30 thousand million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7,2 thousand million euro over three years and France 1,26 thousand million euro (that is 420 millions a year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU took out big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment concerning financings fast starting: report itemising the action of its Member states, press conference, big side event, distribution of booklets...
Operation transparency is significant and appreciated in its fair value: developing countries and society would like that all developed countries do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces to have cleared in 2010 2,2 thousand million euro, what puts it on the good way for the respect for its commitment of 7,2 thousand millions in 2012.
But when they look in the detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the agreement of Copenhagen, "new and additional," to assure that an additional effort is accomplished without being to the detriment of the Public aid to development.
Unfortunately, it does not exist agreed on what mean "new and additional."
While the European Commission had offered a harmonisation, some Member states which France blocked procedure.
Today, each chooses the reference which is the best suitable for it.
The European Commission considered year 2009 for example as a reference: the international financings are supported, and she adds to it 150 millions over three years as financings starting fast.
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year or in terms of level of public aid to development.
In the comparing, France thinks that the financings of " all new plans " of year 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is not reference to the expenses of the previous years or to the total level of Public aid to development.
In concrete terms, the sum of the support of France of developing countries can remain stable (or even diminish), she pretends to respect her commitment in " additional and new" financings...
Other crucial element, sharing out between donations and loans.
There still, it does not exist customary and each chooses its mode of calculation.
Some people, as France, consider 1€ qu 'lent is equivalent to 1€ given.
Evidemment, cela l'évaluation difficilement justifiable: l'effort n'est pas comparable.
If the usage of loans can be justified for some investments which are profitable (often plans linked to the alleviation of the programmes which are based on more efficient technologies), it is fallacious to introduce an euro which they are going to recover as equivalent in an euro which is given... At most, should be counted as its commitments only the cost of the loan for the country lender (that is the equivalent of a rate of interest).
But France has only make such reasoning: she "respects" her 420 million euro commitment being 91,5% of loans (389,8 million euro) and 8,5% of donations (36,1 million euro) - to see the document of the EU to prove by yourlself.
It is the only country of the Union to use the loan so in great numbers.
L'Allemagne y requiert à 46%, tandis que le Danemark, les Pays-Bas ou la Slovaquie (demi-cadratin autres) respectent leurs les engagements avec 100% de dons.
In other words, when the vast majority European Union puts 1€ to satisfy its commitment, France puts only 10 cents and considers that effort is comparable.
Pretty turn of legerdemain!
In summary, in its fast starting financing, France operates on a double fraud: on one hand on the evolution of action in time and in other part on reality of financial effort.
By spending only 36,1 million euro, she succeeds in making believe that she spends 420 "additional and new" millions on coherence with her promises.
The manipulation of the Treasury (because it well seems that it is Bercy who accomplishes arbitration) could have a double negative impact, at the same time within the EU (why other Member states would continue giving if it is enough to cause?) and in negotiations since developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of the precocious financings is only a small question, of relating short term, in comparison with all debates on climate.
But he could be a grain of sand furthermore in the huge machine than UNFCCC is.
Let us hope that it will not be case.
Anyhow, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of precocious financings.
First of all, France could announce a change in its mode of counting for 2011 and on 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and for equity with other countries of the European Union.
But especially, France could move debates forward on stakes of long-term financings (other controversial crucial chapter currently): they will not avoid the question of " the additionalité " or of the mode of counting of loans.
France could change its position to become so progressive on these stakes as it is it on others.
Hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive at Cancun next week.
A surprised announcement on the starting fast of France and on its vision of " the additionalité " and the usage of loans would be likely augment the level of necessary international confidence to advance in debates.
Alert in pesticides ingested by the children
A 10-year-old child ingests in day 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published on Wednesday of the association Future Generations (ex-Movement for rights and respect for the future generations).
The association, which tells that its results "do not have significant statistical value with regard to the weak number of analysed samples, but are illustrative of treated problems," bought between July and September food generally used in four meals and an encas in day by a child of a dozen years, in the supermarkets of the Oise and of Paris.
These meals types, including official recommendations - five fruits and cool vegetables, three dairy products and 1,5 litre of water a day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet of the plate is oppressive: 81 chemical substances among which 42 are classified carcinogenic possible or probable and five certain carcinogenic classified substances as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrinal troublemakers (PE), according to studies of several institutions such the international Research centre on the cancer.
"Even if, in quasi totality of cases, the lawful borders for every chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, they see well in our inquiry that the reality of the exhibition of the consumers in the possibly carcinogenic contaminating and/or PE is worrying," notes the association.
For breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk contain to themselves more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three proving to be as of carcinogenic some as well as near about twenty residues likely to unsettle the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, envisaged as encas by study, present of the traces of six chemical substances of which a fungicide however forbids in France.
The same thing for green beans of Kenya, included in lunch, on which study discerned traces of a powerful insecticide forbidden in the EU.
Besides, the hacked steak, the tuna in box, and even the baguette of bread and the chewing gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
For dinner, the steak of salmon was the "richest " with 34 discerned chemical wastes and even the examination of the plastic plate used to warm up meal in microwave was not exempt from it.
The final risk for the consumer of it "cocktails of contaminating" "is probably underestimated," according to study.
The Alliance Europe They Ecology environmentalists EE-LV, for his/her part, offered "facing the emergency of situation" to institute a moratorium on the use of pesticides, to stop "the increase of diseases of civilisation."
In July, a study of the European agency for food security (EFSA) mentioned the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables used in Europe, among which 76 in cereals.
