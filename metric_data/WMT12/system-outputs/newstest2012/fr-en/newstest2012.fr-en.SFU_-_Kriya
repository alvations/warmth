The Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of tymosenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has refused, in the framework of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft avoidance of the paragraph on charges of Julia tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
The members have refused on second reading of the draft amendment reducing sentences for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently in prison.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for having disadvantageous reached an agreement in principle with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The ruling is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted in December.
Tymosenko described the trial of political revenge of the regime and led to a process of suspicion of bias of the Court also in the West.
The project to cancel the paragraph 365 of the criminal law on the basis of which the ex-premère Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have required 226 votes to approve it.
Victory Jamahiriya
The release or rebellion Jamahiriya already has its losers.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an undisclosed location in the desert and without him the war is over.
It remains to determine the winners.
As is customary in the region, the election winners are the Islamists, but is it the moderates and radicals.
The National Transitional Council decreed the law's normal Sharia and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a flight is cut out.
Women can forget the emancipation, the insensitive possible dela faith are punishable by the death penalty...
It is the Koran that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator society composed of warring tribes.
Libya will such an order as we cannot represent him and as we would surely not.
But our way of life is not unique, is not the best and probably not beneficial to the Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamic warriors have gratefully accepted the help of dogs infidels.
The only excuse is that this is not a américian General who led the NATO raids, but Allah which they hailed the greatness in each attack.
When it comes to pick the winners in Libya, the West does not belong
We fought the fire, used Islam and our poilitiques turned away from the dictator as political ally without it offers no benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq militarily, we do not deal with Libya.
There should be no problem for the premises to débarasser of "crusaders."
Does that without occupation of the land, oil companies will have easy access to the black gold libyien.
Perhaps not as much and the West can boast a finally desintéressée protection of human rights.
If we were to prevent these followers of the sharia.

The Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They have formed a human shield
Hundreds of students from universities have formed a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
By doing so they want to support the nuclear programme of their countries about a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then welcomed the death of had and to Israel.
Hundreds of students from universities in Esfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the Isfahan nuclear technology centre where is transformed the uranium.
They have shown clearly that they would defend the programme nuclaire of their country at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in its latest information that Iran has not ceased to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
It was reported in Israel of a possible attack of Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon at the site and then welcomed the death of had and to Israel.
In the event of an attack, whose objective is to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets were not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where is enriched uranium.
The diet of a child obese: do not take breakfast and takes the sausages for the dinner
More than a third of children ranging in age from 9 to 13 were overweight, 9 per cent of écoliersont an above-average weight and 5 percent are obese.
As the current research shows the obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important is the environment in which the human being and operates the models.
On the tables of obese children examples of the sausages 50 percent more often than among families with children in normal weight.
19 percent of obese had chips for dinner in the survey with advocacy "obesity is not a random"
For the families of the small big sport is also not a habit now, which is the case for most of today's schoolchildren, only 15 percent said that at least once a week, the Movement's parents found the time for active.
Investigation on 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students participated in primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "obesity is not a random," sustained efforts by the Assembly and the health insurance company.
 From the beginning it has more than 12,000 students in sixth at the third who signed up for the project.
One of the key factors that cause a dramatic rise in the number of children who are overweight or obese, is the lack of proper food and lack of physical exercise.
"only half the children questioned notes, for example, eat five times a day small déjeuner-en cases - lunch - goûter- dinner, which is the basic principles of good food," said one of the results of the investigation.
Without breakfast and sausages at dinner
The experts stressed the fact that for a healthy development it requires some basic details such as a breakfast at home at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat at my same time.
In the majority of families each takes his breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been identified is only a tenth of the population does not take any of breakfast.
The breakfast is the basis of a good food daily.
The survey has shown that in families of obese children are consuming more often unhealthy chips.
Almost every student - not to mention the weight - drink every day of sugary drinks (70 per cent).
More than 40 per cent of the children questioned the sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15 percent.
Prepares you tone food
Another part of the survey gave children selected (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) to prepare its own food from choices according to their own taste and their personal opinions.
"the preferences of Czech children of 12 to 15 years are far, to plan for a healthy diet, the ideal."
Among their favorite dishes, there are many cakes, meats and mills.
"the most alarming is such a big favour the sugary now," is shown in the results of the investigation.
For lunch they are pasta which have taken the lead just before the white meat.
The children have no wanted starches and preference for fish and vegetable meal was very low.
Cap on health
The survey also found that the children are ready to change their habits after they receive the information.
"during a check on a group of participants in the survey who completed the questionnaire after the meeting of awareness" obesity is not a random, "then attended a deliberate desire to move to a healthy diet," show the results of the investigation.
The most prominent was for the sugary now because the children began to prefer drinking water.
The children were ticked off the questionnaire, the white meat and fish as main course and reduce the sweet dishes and the "knedliky" (Czech spécialté pellets of flour for bread or potatoes).
The designer must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In an article for presentation on the way to learn for the designers, I started a little angry because there were many from the beginning.
I never thought to what would happen after that.
The presentations of three professionals of specialty, the clothing of characters and a seminar on what is happening on the ground.
And it will be worse.
As we approach the final exams and we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when it is a matter of course on Saturdays and Sundays is truly "packed."
This time we have with the Director alenka (over there was no boy) Treaty in the way we dress the woman without a measurement standards.
And the women of this type is the majority.
One has a small neck, the other of a boy, without curve, another of overweight.
The designer should know how presentationally ammenuiser arms wide, prolonging a neck or curves up necessary.
We arrived and nicely to emphasize the figure and also not to pay too much of a conspicuous of types of women as Jennifer Lopez with a strong breast and pelvic delivered and a fine size.
If there is such a difference between the size and the HIPS so that the skirts or trousers are not at all, it is the blow to the face.
And you will regret not because the clothing which falls neatly is invaluable.
In a skirt on a position you feel much better than that in shifting, enroule time and does not involve the belt and so on.
For those with a male appearance have can afford a clothing style Tucker, with pieces of tissue conjured, or embroidery.
Naturally, there are many other examples of appearances and I am happy that I have all week to sort through all the information.
But I also fear that in light of what I should do at home there too.
Each trainee got a celebrity to dress for day and evening.
We have to take into account the current appearance, the kind of mode of the personality, and his appearance.
I have to "pay" Miranda Kerr, that perhaps you know of the Victoria's secret campaign.
At the back of my mind, it is a pleasure, because it is better than clothing to Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has recently been almost 100 kilograms (do not take my statement, SVP, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We must cut and sew from magazines or look on the Internet, printing and work the graphics.
The moodboard, as we say in the end result, expresses our personal style and our relationship with the establishment figure.
Also reflect on the party's graphical styling is also important.
The designer cannot and only the physical but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on specific commodities trends for handbags, the coats, etc).
Mario kamenik, designer and artist, we have talked to all this.
But this,... until Sunday
The designer has a vision
Three guests of specialty gave a diversified aspect to Saturday's meeting filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, designer, Jakub polanka fashion designer and Ben RENC, photographer of fashion.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know the use.
And a talented designer knows work with a single dress differently.
The variability is paramount for this example.
Such as the trench-coat which had to be increased from conventional way with a Jean and a T-shirt as a light coat but it also can clothe the naked body, with escarpins and taking the photograph as a dress.
Or it enough to roll up the sleeves or neck and immediately have a new look.
"play with this," he stressed.
But I especially enjoyed the following advice: "for the work you need to know the rules" perfectly.
"then you can begin to break," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why it was trying to learn the rules, what to do with, where, why, while in the lifestyle magazines are sometimes seen something else.
No statement on the fashion.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer clothing must be more options than those photographed.
This is to say that for fashion story to be a 10 pages (and thus a dozen models) I have to be ready for "retailler" at least a fortnight.
And also, clothing and its combination with other elements appear completely differently than in reality.
We must reckon with this in a creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes half the succés has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna is not a super Singer but image and marketing have made him a star world.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of the services of designers still remains cautious.
And the faces sometimes view them as necessary (it enough that I know something, but what I come through the second).
And if someone is a styling from us, then we have to count on the fact that it teaches us with a high likelihood a completely different size (smaller) than he has in reality.
Then we have to navigate on Google and ascertain whether the news of Boulevard are State of the celebrity, if it has lost weight or swollen etc...
Honza and Mario we have asked Sunday about the heart that it is not enough to to move in the fashion designer and assemble models.
It needs to communicate with the people he dresses and it is so important to be a good psychologist.
Know guess people, not to flatter, maintain its opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and the use of new elements you cannot just throw everything and say, 'My God! horror.
"you will find few cases you find cute and that you do with what the focus," said Mario.
It has shown us what must contain the so-called "placovka" or bag of designer.
It is the one you fasten around the waist and that you on itself for all you need.
In addition to clear things such as scissors, the rollers on dépilation or pins to nurse, as well as nylon yarn (that the designer used to photograph of products such as bags, hats), special clips with which it closed a garment in the back, whether it is too much (the PIN or other staple are not utlisables because they could spoil the clothing) or a sewing kit.
For that we are not only of the people listening but have tried something so practice they have taught us how to accurately ressemeller shoes.
And during the photo in the workshop where the surface is equal, the shoe could spoil, let alone to lextérieur.
And so we have bonded and bonded.
We did not receive the scissors for not getting hurt.
It therefore really need skills.
Mario was good when he congratulated me for my generation.
My comptence State is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we have learned in the second weekend of course
I began to understand that making the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses, for everyone to say what he wants.
The need for speed the run competes across America.
Revision
Originally a race without problem is due to a combination of mistakes stupid people who have nothing to do with a routine morning trip to work.
It is up to a certain extent the ambition of everyone but is meaningless if nobody wants to do more.
The new party subtitled the run has produced great expectations before his release.
The Government promised to take a new direction with the series of arms need for speed already playing a kind of old and out from the parties jouables which would come not just with points.
So we were curious how will be the main added-on heroes in the fate of his car and does what it wants.
As already in the series NFS, the result is completely different than atttendait.
These are potentially racing games of arcades, but the whole suppresses because of some unnecessary mistakes which have existed for several years.
They are not really errors but rather an expression of idleness incomprehensible from developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are in the adventure whose main hero Jack has acute emotional problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal race across America.
You just behind the wheel on the west coast to San Francisco and your Mission is the first in New York.
The idea has some interesting points.
The route is divided into ten steps and then in more than 50 races.
Which means that each race is on a different route and the steps in different environments which differ from each other quite well and are interesting.
The player did not feel that the game offered something similar.
Some environments are also fairly fine even if the technical chart is the same type that the earlier rounds.
Finally, this is not the end of the world.
But the actions across the desert in autumn landscape or in snow-covered mountains of high is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in more from time to time interspersed with an unusual component.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm which you significantly reduced the visibility.
Then in the mountains, you must pay attention to what an avalanche do not fall over.
In addition to the different races are well arranged the one behind the other.
There are only a handful of people, but that is enough.
There are some moments you seek to surpass the number of opponents (as in a conventional) then you chase race against the clock (classic duel with the timer) and then you still face another duel with an opponent.
From time to time, you also the police entering the game and tries to make the situation reportedly rarely.
The novelty is crossing outside the vehicle.
It is, rather, una interactive animated when most of the time Jack flees to someone and you must help the banging on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
The surprise is that there are fewer moments of this type that what you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is that because it is not likely to affect and, in the background, in the elements that make up the game.
The code of conduct is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that currently there is nothing extraordinary, but it does not appear to be negative.
For the realistic simulation you go see elsewhere.
But while we can find better in the conccurrence the type of conduct goes very well with the type of design of racing.
So everything is OK.
The problems began to emerge after a certain time.
Has the diffférence's code of conduct, the crash has not yet been completed.
We do not expect this game a complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how is your Auto, this is not completely good.
During tight overruns touch you sometimes mutually slightly but otherwise your auto part in voltiges mad.
Or is in tatters.
Thanks to restart system that is not really a problem but that you really riles.
The restart is so that when you have broken the figure or you stepped into the scene the game you back under the last point on the route.
But you only with 5 redémarrages.
If you used the five redémarrages you repeat the game from the beginning.
It is more a tool, if something is not done properly, that you can really count on here.
Sometimes the redémarrages do not and we must find a solution by remémorrant route from memory the piece in question.
The major fault of this game is that the same actions were found in the same places.
For instance, there was some disagreement that we must move from a certain way or it doesn't.
Otherwise you meet on a given location of vehicles "civilians" in the same way that you come first, fifth, five seconds ahead of or a minute late.
What Angers the situations when you see easily slip the opponent between two oncoming cars and when you arrive, you, you must either be put aside and the conturner or braking.
It is if you go ahead of him because it was "calculated" in such a way as to the specific situation there always comes very close to your nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
During the time of the game, you arrive in some places, again without the time, and you always have the same opponent before you in the same place.
This irritates the more at the end of the game when going on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The enemy must at all costs be heard before you.
When it passes before you it obscures the view of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you go in collision a number of times.
It is understandable that the object of the game is to make something exciting and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you soon ennuyez.
And it is a shame, because through a simple code of conduct, the game is interesting and places with so many action that you do not have the time to follow everything that happens.
And it is if it is because of the unique concept of 50 routes, which the order of camel is that there are no chance of boredom or something else.
The change is the brainchild of car during races.
You must pay attention to the fuel pumps on the routes because you can change cars there most of the time that you enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for American cities, gas-guzzlers straight for highways and the super sports cars to exotic charms on the conducted very yaw techniques such as roads in the mountains.
And the challenges which are racing in specific areas that you know of adventure, is fine with the regime's main story.
You get not only the medals but also the experience points to add to your profile that is common to the challenges and the adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, number beginning to unlock.
It connects on-line with the function autolog which among others compare your results with those of other players and you provide other functions in the community.
One of the more difficult to understand is the situation blows in the last race of the adventure.
You get with your car in the subway tunnel (it is) where you unlucky in the dark on the way (it smacks).
Your speed indicator you said between 150 and 200 km / hour (presumably) and you get a subway train that you send the car directly on the scrapheap.
Has the editor we discussed for several days to know if anyone has ever considered the creators of this game or if they really take us for fools.
The technical side of the game is not extra visual, but the party is generally pleasant and in some cases really Super.
What annoys is only in extreme situations, the imagery is not the level and in some cases dramatically.
This is true of the accident with a large number of participants when imagery fluid does you no good anymore.
The sound is good and the track is the choice.
In order to please the largest number and particularly the most noise for a young audience a new track has been established in the style "I mixing everything," but it can be expected that nobody will buy the stake to the music.
General impression of need for speed: the run is really confused.
If the game had not these stupid mistakes we can safely say that it is the best of NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the sense of not being finished.
The amusement is really good, but prepare you for what it gets you in the eye with the force of a reflector airfield.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European européeenne:
The Czechs are behaving like négativistes and Euro-sceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has drastically cut the balance between the institutions'
"I did not expect to a war as hard."
"It will take 5.6 years before the situation is calm and that all players are accustomed to their new role ', as miléna vicenova began his presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations so understandable and visible, to the point that a large number of speakers of the Faculty of Law of the University Charles might envy, it revealed how she takes its motto "understandable and openly on Europe" very seriously.
Mrs vicenova has paid tribute to the work of Herman Van rompuye permanent, the new President of the European Council.
"from the outset resounded the criticism it is bland, a rond-de-cuir, that it cannot rempplir no mission and I must say that it has cut the impetus to everybody, because it takes its role to perfection."
"This is a man who listened 27 Member States, good communication with them and has a clear vision of the direction of Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for the common foreign and defence policy in the context of an answer to the question: "Who's Who in the European Union?" "has what telephone call, so as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater transparency of the policy of the Union faced with States, as is the China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibit our syrecky (cheese to paste cooked that feels very strong) 
Mrs vicenova also referred to the agenda which has lived, live and live in a time near the European Council.
She called the Czech presidency two years ago of succés.
The Czechs have solved the mounting financial crisis, the gas crisis or had organized a summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of gourvernement very negative and has damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic to the EU representation at this time is very busy.
In the words of Ambassador, "the activity became prominent" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that still continues to be resolved now.
There must also approve the new budget septimal who becomes very complicated due to the current economic situation.
As it is, the budget will be thin and economies, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything has to be solved in the framework of future negotiations.
Madame Ambassador recalled its slogans with which she arrived in Brussels for a Europe 'understandable ."
"I don't really like the abbreviations, foreign words, the jargons that nobody understands.
As must understand the people that it is true that in Brussels person does gherkins rods or warped, banana differemment major or that nobody has prohibition on syrecky ."
She wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more of Czechs in European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being the Eurosceptics and of people who see things that in their more negative than positive.
In addition it is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The result, she said, a number of factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of intent and a little support from the party.
Also the Czech Presidency to succés then stressed the force and the cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"believe me, when it comes to me, the Poles, the Magyar, Slovak, this French tells me: 'back, what you there and that is still the Visegrad Group?" and it is not at all happy ."
According to Mrs vicenova, in the near future that are new rules of tough fiscal policy that awaits the member countries.
This is the concept of a two-speed Europe, except at different speeds, rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro zone and other" from the area.
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of enhanced cooperation."
For starters, it was said that cooperation among countries that want it and those who do not wish to remain in their corner ."
"There will be a lot of similar institutions and there will be a two-speed Europe," Mrs vicenova are expected.
From this point of view it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuye to determine the basis by which all the issues that impact on the EU should be discussed among all members of the EU and not only the memebres in the eurozone.

The innovator IBM began the second century of his existence
If someone should seek the banner which expresses the nearest to the IBM strategy, would be "the long term."
For a wider audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet it has been 100 years since its establishment.
The basis of the long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, the visionary Thomas J. Watson SR.
It has left this slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to consider.
His slogan 'believe'! "became the footprint around which will develop the life of a future giant (and also the title of the internal newsletter that IBM began to publish in 1935).
That was the basis of the corporate culture soignement developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thinking of continuous movements towards the future.
IBM has survived one hundred years thanks to the fact that it was always true to its core values and however has not been afraid to change all the other around it.
It gave us during our first century of transforming technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will achieve even more "a délaré for the anniversary the current Director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A clearly prepared
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after its own employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American workers to vacation pay, insurance paid by the employer over a uniform of employee elegant and well prepared a system of rewards for inventors and the commmerciaux.
In the same way IBM has a well-prepared sytème relationships with clients.
The company had initially brilliant in the discovery of talents- as one of the first companies to have removed any form of discrimination and could thus have the choice.
The current plan is completely in line with the strategy because it will be an anti-discrimination femme- Virginia rometty - which should replace Palmisano as head of IBM.
She is working with IBM for 30 years and currently holds the post of Head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years is what we call the jamy, the brain- storming in line until derive much of strategies for the future and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm for almost 500,000 people work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that provide a secure position in the fields of business.
"since the early IBM had a concept of institution, rather than of a technology company," said rosabeth MOSS kanter, a Professor of Economics at the School of Economics at Harvard and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a firm technlogique but a firm that helps to solve the problems in the world of business by using its technology," added geogre colony of the consulting firm Forrester research.
As the firm itself says there is a difference between entering the market and create this market.
IBM - or the "Big Blue," as it is known colloquially in the United States, given its slogan- in 100 years it has grown up to become one of the world's largest companies.
This is obviously the firm technological versatile - it is developing software, hardwares, infrastructure, housing, services for the server products until the Council nanotechnology.
It has several patents of all US technology firms and five of its employees were awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among its findings stands for example the distributor of tickets, the credit card, the SWAp, the financial Bar Code or the diskette.
IBM has recovered this year with 220 billion dollars the second largest technology firm, according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it above Microsoft.
Overview in advance
It is not every innovation and invention that took the preference of the client and the time - for example, IBM had not passed the bet on a own os / 2 operating system, the miracle online service or an IBM computer pcjr:
"starting from the time when your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot émotionellement remain ensconced on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For that IBM had no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it is.
Unlike the example of conccurent Microsoft that at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In the IBM revenue, the services, which are trained for a fifth with software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
But in 1990 she was with more of the motié in the highest representative of hardware.
After the year 2000 IBM has sold assets to at $15 billion, in cettre period it has invested $58 billion in the buying of technology opportunities.
It continues in investments and even starting in 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to its first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who, during the Great Depression has also increased its investments.
It appears now that IBM is the current crisis without incident?
The share price IBM has progessé starting in 2008 in a rocket of 120 percent, the net profit of the company continues to grow.
The company's logo IBM is to change everything, but not its values.
It is reasonable to expect that the flexible giant master other crises.
IBM history: from the slices of cheese made up for flights in the cosmos.
The company International Business Machines (IBM) was born in New York, a hundred years ago; it was originally the name of complicated computing tabulating recording Corporation.
She took the name IBM in 1924 - originally it was a mark used by a branch of a company in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the year 80 of the 19th century.
They possessed the technology such as the old "pointeuses," the clock with the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles ranlett flint that until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the society.
Flint embaucha the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help lead the company.
The ITF then leader of the shadow to the founder of the firm, the Watson ideas that underpins until now the identity and the culture of the company.
Watson headed the firm kusqu' in 1952.
IBM, as its name said, began with the production of all possible machines for business - trancheuses cheese and meat until cash registers.
During the first four years during which Watson headed, the turnover was redoubled to $9 million and began the company's expansion in all parts of the world.
Watson was unique to the company if that after 40 years of direction is the son who held the seat of Director, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his direction IBM began development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s the people and the IBM computers helped NASA has guided the flights in the cosmos - on mercury, Saturn and the flight to the Moon in 1969.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM system / 360.
The classic PC which determined the standard computer of the time with the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sells its computers factory in Chinese society Lenovo, but acheta the consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to care for and services with a high added value.
The successful strategy at IBM in the past three years - is the concept smarter planet "a more intelligent" planet.
Its goal is the intelligent uilisation of technology in areas not yet exploited such as transport and urban management.
In the area of trade IBM has recently developed a platform "smarter" trade that helps trading manager at the trade round.
IBM also has a strong history in our territory.
It created its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Now, besides IBM RT, there is also the center of strategic outsourcing of Brno.
The central for Central and Eastern Europe headquarters in Prague, and there is also the team of international research and development for the recognition of the floor.

Ivette you can keep this donkey, I want no more!
Darina rychtarova (53) has said, that is!
After her husband Joseph rychtar (53) becomes a bodyguard and lover of of Iveta bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph woke up in his dream rose and returns to the House.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa may return to the House, but not as my partner," explained rychtarova.
When Darina rychtarova Donna asylum in summer to bartosova in her house, she was confident that the couple would not work.
When Iveta after 30 days asked to move from ricany, Pepa denied not the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved.
With the time Darina has resigned, accepted the points of her husband and ultimately say goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested to know with whom her husband layer.
If rychtar and bartosova separates there will not be a wife for him on the outside the door of the House.
"This is the biological father of my son, and if he wants to end his life in our common home, nobody will away."

"We do not set down together and it does not concern me to know where it is going, and whether she had any connection with.
I know this is my fault, I fell in love (D 'Iveta on me and I take full responsibility, "concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: This affects you too?
If you ask men to determine vices typical of women, all alike are able to break the "their channel."
My dear women, you are going to see in the following flawed women who come to pump the blood of veins of men.
The purchases
Your half you made remarks that are dependent on shopping?
Should you buy at least a garment in a week?
You simply buying and over salary packages at the time?
In your case we can talk about the purchases as a vice.
Some women believe they should restrict their passion to make purchases.
But you say, which responses to lèche-vitrine clothes shops, to seek for oneself of cute clothes and then tested all the booth at (the ideal of different colours)?
And although for most women buy is a hobby, it could be for a living hell.
You only remember how many times have you told your spouse simply wait to entry...
Dissatisfaction constant
"I am not too big"?
"I need to weight loss at least 5 kilos - I should start playing?
"I like?
Those sentences do not recall something?
Yes?
You are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the case that you should stop to take care of yourself, but a large number of men is allergic to the fact that their partner is still complain about his appearance.
The strong sex does not hesitate to say that increases the frequency of these complaints and more women become empoisonnantes.
The odre and cleanliness in the first place
It is like a merry-go-round infinity.
Wash the windows, pass the vacuuming, cleaning up the land, to the dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You made the remarks to your partner that it works with dirty feet on the ground, the children they had smeared the washbasin, fouling the window of the living room, and that gives you a lot of work?
If you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that we should not exaggerate and that the cleanliness and order should not be in first place in the family.
However, this desire harmless cleanliness may spoil your family relations and even peace.
The undermining of
"is this survêtement spent away."
"you put these accounts old socks again tomorrow?
"a wet towel has nothing to do with land."
If you on your partner this work to undermine so several times a day, you really break.
It is obvious that you fail to think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Perhaps that if people knew, the women would not have to do so much work to undermine...
The slander on persiflage
The slander on persiflage but also insults against someone are also present in some women.
The women are brought on relations and thus are happy to deal with issues like that, where, with WHO, how and why.
Perhaps each of us missed a small persiflage harmless here and there.
The hands on the heart it is a characteristic of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflent, even despise the other and to those around them, particularly in the work in a group of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
The attacker hokeyiste jagr participated twice to the Philadelphia victory during Monday's match NHL on the ice of Caroline and is now head of productive Czech players for the competition.

"I am really glad of it."
"I want to play on it."
"all these years in the NHL the other team players have tried to play on me, but now it is my turn," said jagr.

"This is no."
"We played the match only with an experienced player, the rest it were young people."
"but there is nothing to do, that's right," said Jacques Martin.

How have evolved the fares since 1989
Up in Czechoslovakia in 1989, there were only five State travel agents: cedok, sporturist, ckm, rekrea and autotourist.
Travel agents at that time offering travel especially in countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to West was very limited.
The Czech Tourists traveled to the holiday in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, the Black Sea and Crimea in Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception to the period from 1962 until 1972, when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia and the regime began to have a propensity for West and travel to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the nétait not authorized for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovak) to travel even within the socialist countries individually.
In the case where the Czechoslovak citizens to travel individually by example in Poland and the Soviet Union it needed a letter of invitation if not the individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agents at that time also offered trips to the West, however it is important to wait all night with a sleeping bag or have a "knowledge" in the travel agency.
And even after that there was still a long way to go.
The agreement for the currency which was vital to travel West was denied to people "politically incorrect" who could not travel at all.
The currency Czechoslovakia was not tradable, however, and it was not possible to obtain resources without the agreement of Western currency (currency) to travel to the West.
The Czechs often spent their holidays in the country where there were so many summer homes and chalets that the Czechs had bought and usually lasts until now.
The travel of Czechs have since been great since 1989.
Although until 1989, the holiday in East Germany and Bulgaria were up to, the Czechs have spent the last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries all over the world.
The great paradox of which we are not aware today is that the country is Croatia's most popular when it was not possible to go free until 1989 as part of the former Yugoslavia.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries in the West have caused an enormous wave for short visits mainly in Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovak could not long travel by plane to the West that everybody wanted to see at least a moment.
For example in Paris tour were the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income does not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of Czech travel itself at this time to prevail with its own Food Canning, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown, which has enabled our tourists finally after decades of Western be free to buy the currency.
Our standard of living and that the average wages have risen which caused around the year 1997 another important point.
Thanks to a growing demand for travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare towers with of air charters, which runs through contracts have greatly reduced the costs compared to what it was before.
During the late 1990s of the last century the Czechs had links without visas with the majority of developed countries of the world to join the US who later helped our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of tourism's, when was prepared the first charter flights to an exotic countries, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year of direct air charters are bringing the Czech tourists in the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It is more than exotic 100.000 Czechs who visit the country each year.
Yet an interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our development's arrived in 2008.
The 17 November 2008 the had abolished visas for Czech tourists and has allowed our country to be completely into developed.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history has spent more than half of their holiday abroad (50, 3 per cent) and for the first time in history has spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for a vacation abroad including utilities annexes. kroner per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but it is likely to end with a situation without solution "a pat"
So far, nearly 5mois Czech football is without President and it is likely that the successor to Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after a General Assembly to be held Thursday in nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on what rules of vote to proceed.
Without that agreement, it is not possible to vote for one of three candidates.
Jindrich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomas paclik are interested in the direction of the Czech football.
Hašek resigned in June and during his departure has called his colleagues has come together and find a strong personality to lead the football in the future.
Only during the era after Hašek Football came back into the differences between the Chambers of the association which fail to agree on a joint candidate.
This has fully demonstrated the 16 September when it came to choosing a new President.
The Assembly delegates met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiation has been blocked and there has not even been issue to deal with how to elect.
There is no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seems, the representatives also assessed and many staff members with full power.
In this single point there was a partial agreement since that moment with the assistance of the Office for the State and the law, that the representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
The differences still remain on the rules for the election.
It is all too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its negotiation scheduled or special, added nothing to the situation
Public opinion about the possibilitě have changed several times, but the problem still remains the same.
The question is: how can the third round to avoid falling into the PAT.
"The bone of contention is the following: either investigate the statutes or find another model," was one of the three Vice-Presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda representing professional football in the association.
According to the rules of model provided wins in the third round of candidates who received the most votes percentage in the House for which he is a candidate.
The Moravia is ready as are said to withdraw so that wins the candidate who received the highest percentage of votes of two chambers.
And the Czechs explores the condition that the winner would have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"only then it would lose the idea of two previous rounds and bicameral completely reject the concept," admits Svoboda which includes the objections of the Moravian and that it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the regulations in force.
It is surprising that Tomas paclik is also agree even if it believed that the rules of the elections established under the statutes most pelta benefit among all candidates.
"I hope that we vote to the articles of association."
"so that there is not yet an insane ideas conceived by a representative as in past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his talks mainly defined himself against pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future set and constructively.
"The possible today in European championship qualification should calm the whole world."
"The football will once again on a wave of happiness and Aure more drive for a cooperation" adds the jablonec officer who among the three was the greatest soccer experience in leadership both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is very tense.
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and the Moravians, but there are some trends to change the regulations to drawing."
"This can lead to a deadlock at the General Assembly."
"I hope that the sound reason will prevail" rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a joint agreement to all parties.
Some réuunions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire leadership of football will be full for the match.
The specially chartered flight in which must travel to podgorice inter alia the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and rajchl, has not been lifted for technical reasons and it sought an alternative to keep a part of the Executive Committee on the ground of retaliation.
At the end it was the Ministerial Meeting, which could take place Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport Joseph dobes would be very happy to receive the warring parties in the sports association the highest in the country and encourage them to reach an agreement.
In the game there are many: a State allocation, the credibility of the football and also the General Assembly of the European Czech sports, which must determine the direction of the Czech sports after the financial problems of sazka.
Paclik is off to fight for the post of President, because he saw no candidate correct.
If the Chief of footballers of Plzen Tomas paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile has responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (afrt) it would not campaign for this high office.
"If there is such a candidate I supported it, I fight for him and I do not come to the election."
"but in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," said paclik to the Czech News Agency (KTC).
The motivation of paclik is to compete with Miroslav pelta and Jindrich rajchl to try prevent pelta access for the leadership of the afrt that apparently would be given favourite for this election.
Paclik also emphasizes that mean the elections he would keep the post of Chairman only until 2013 year scheduled for a General Assembly.
He is keen in high-level civil and experienced a manager but is not linked with the world of football.
"I talk with people who have the profile," he says.
"For me this has been a terrible when some said they did not want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change that image," he added.
That, say, discomfort paclik above all is the relationship between pelta and the President of the Union's regional football of Plzen Roman berbr, rights to the controversial reputation who is known in the wings as lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates to the General Assembly.
For paclik it is not acceptable that pelta occupies the position of President.
"If they win, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"and with the support of berbr, who is a business, it would be less favourable to football," proclaimed paclik.
What worries the still is the fact that the name of pelta was pronounced in tapping a few years ago as part of an investigation into a bribery scandal, for whom's pelta has emerged without penalty.
"I do not know what prestige pelta would soccer."
"and how are seen in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA" said paclik, who said some time ago "if pelta becomes President, I sell the Club of Plzen."
In the case where paclik will come out to Thursday's vote, it would have to prove that it could cooperate with felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by paclik before the General Assembly in September that had ended in a fiasco, think the same thing.
"He (pelta) would be the first with which go."
"It was a big capacity"
"he would be able to show by example as head of the representation.
"but as manager of the Association" it would not be able.
"I keep my nose into what I do not know," said paclik which in September has attracted much attention when they voted for the cancellation of the Commission of arbitrators with ludek macela that has replaced Dagmar damkova.
Paclik argues that it would be at the level to lead the association.
It takes such as its capacity to lead private firms and that he also directs since last year the Club of Plzen who celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the premier division.
"I have the muscle to change anything in the world of sport and to provide a certain culture."
"I freinerais the influence of some interest groups that have, for example, tend to affect the Disciplinary Commission and appeal, which leads to bad taste," added paclik which chache not his antipathy for the head of the Sparta Daniel kretinsky.
It would also consider a closer relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose power to lobby to high-level policy would generate for the sport more tax money on games.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should be."
"for the tax on gambling as the State political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also tell where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not do its existing link with the club of Plzen as something negative even if he claims that the President of the afrt should be "above the parties."
Pelta is further linked with jablonec and rajchl with dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions of Plzen club to someone if I must return a year and a half later, "said paclik.
Pelta promised a new constitution for the afrt which should bring an end to the situations of Pat.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Association of football one of presidential candidate Miroslav pelta has promised that if he is elected, the afrt will have new regulations that should end in the future to squabbles over the rules for the elections.
The jablonec officer is before the Thursday meeting in nymburk very optimistic that the succés today of the representation of football should alleviate this squabble before the vote.
Pelta before the election in September, which has not been specifically promised to devote themselves to the national representation and the availability of financial resources if elected.
It was decided to be a candidate at the last minute just before the General Assembly and the past two months could well lead to defend its vision of the direction of the football and to present it in a broader context.
"people at all levels have long been of football and expect that the President" Thursday.
"they feel that this is the best time for leadership of the Association, he adds," but it is linked with the club of jablonec, has worked many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
This is also why he has enough experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that the problems with the election is a euphoria that prevailed at lépoque of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately in the General Assembly in June of the regulations had been approved not perfect as all were found."
"If there were not all these various interprétattions we would already have a President since September," said pelta.
It is precisely the revision of the most important document in the civic association, which has taken the full attention of the delegates.
"If I go President, I take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," added pelta.
Then it, apparently, of avoiding his opponents.
He has said previously that he can work with Jindrich rajchl that he admits in his legal training and it knows that his adversaire-candidat would be its first Vice-President.
He did not attack long tonas paclik who instead continues to criticize pelta.
"It develops in the football for a year and has already had some succés."
"his attacks, however, were not the most honorable and has surprised many people" during the campaign.
"that is also why some have now doubts about his character," said pelta to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the declarations made in September.
Its most powerful weapon is said to his knowledge of football competitions from the lowest level to the national réprésentation.
This should be a vitirne of football.
"and I also efforcerais to complete all the cases that began with that of bohémians or very the corruption scandal."
"I would be entering into negotiations with the private and public sector so that we can achieve enough money for any football," told the Czech News Agency the KTC 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment to head the football would only bring no change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he said at strahov with understandable nervousness since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios with the General Assembly, he believed that the delegates will not go to nymburk for nothing.
"There is a single point of discord over how to vote in the third round when we reach the Excel."
"football has need of credibility and it will not get that when there is with a new leader," as said of optimistically pelta two days before the day probably decisive for his career as a public official.
Rajchl promised that under his leadership the afrt would begin working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich rajchl was elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic to the General Assembly on Thursday that does not suit to large numbers of people, apparently.
However, rajchl promised that if he is elected starts to work hard.
It seeks to make systemic changes and Executive Committee members are responsible for different areas of football.
It also promised to settle the case bohémians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, the football more money and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hašek.
"as President I am deal of football as a whole."
"international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, of professional football and of an efficient football for youth."
"but I am not saying that I will do that alone 'rajchl said in an interview for KTC.
"I am a team player and want to have the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member" focuses on a specific area.
"and I want difficult missions for football as a great step forward."
"a lot of people are not happy, because it will begin to work hard rather than criticize the other" he added.
It reported, apparently, that he would not stand as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"a connection to me, know that I worked 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if this is the coup, and if I have some people behind me that I will constantly in the foot and issue doubts on each of my actions," explaining why his reluctance.
"a lot of people have told me that I should not abandon, because they would also."
"CSTA a confidence that I cannot fail," he says.
What the motivation, they say, is to continue the work started with Hašek.
"for the last two years there has been a great work of fact and I will not let it fall."
"there are processes that have been launched that will impact in some years and I would not like to see someone stopping them.," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hašek.
"I believe in a systematic work and this is something that Mirek pelta does not make."
"the people behind it will who fairaient game in such a way that it would be only for those who were selected."
"you can blame me a number of things, but surely not situation to withstand somebody."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for all, and all the world will be happy not only those who were selected
And it confirms once again that it would only be a President on the Czech Republic.
"and if there are those who say the opposite, I am prepared to do its utmost to Moravia."
"for example, this is the time to consider that the Second Division is divided into two parts, one Czech and one Moravian whose winners find themselves in first division."
"There is no situation as now with only three team Moravians in the Division because the problem is to find the young players.
As Tomas paclik, President of the Club in Plzen, entered in the competition for the post of President, rajchl cannot evaluate his own chances of winning.
"I sense an ongoing support of the Czech Chamber that has elected its Vice Vice-Chair and knows that with me there will be some succés," said rajchl which envisages among its future succés to save tens of millions of kroner on contracts disadvantageous, contract negotiations with TV and on the Gaming Act.
Instead, it said that the fact that the association is not unified is a mistake common to all.
While it says about pelta "that he was disqualified because the Czech footblal would lose its credibility" with him, he believes that the second opponent paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer the football.
"No one can doubt in Plzen this year he has done a superb job."
"If elected, he would surely in what has been started by Hašek and no significant changes among persons" in committees.
"He does not want to spoil its succés' rajchl said that assessment of its rivals.

A book shows how swimming pool you can experience the greater well-being.
When Iris meder research will travel during the past 18 months, there is one subject that should not fail in his luggage: a bathing suit.
Lying on his back in the water, it OBSERVA the project cupolas artistically arranged, and Europe against the marbles Putten waiting on the other side of the pool and had to admire the Art Nouveau meticulously restored of these pools converted.
If a swimming pool was her happy, she noted in his book without delay all the details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian meder and it had presented them in his book published: "badefreuden (joys of bath." The municipal swimming pools covered in Munich, the Palace of historic bath in the Black Forest, "hardcore" concrete buildings in the Taunus.
It has conducted its "trips to the bathroom the most exceptional of central Europe" in 13 countries in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places respectively in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The German 46 years is a true expression of the culture of the bath.
Meder, explains that she has little interest in the sport but ELL feels drawn to the water in a completely different way.
It is frustrating that fans of the swimming are forced to confront the blue tiles and live with the stench of bleach while the joggers inhale the aroma envoûtant forest of spruce or can listen to the trill of merry birds in the park.
"one day I wondered why the pools should in fact be always if laides" said the Viennese.
"I began making a collection of fine baths."
The surface of the water strengthens doubling the architecture
A diving into a swimming pool and the volatile oils sauna, a factor of welfare in the swimming rooms are enormous because all the senses are awake, according to meder.
And if the builders would have given a little more death, rooms to swim could be a true sheer delight for the eyes: "instead of a floor there is a surface water" in the halls of swimming.
"on the one hand it is transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the building as a whole."
All surfaces are optically in a double: voûtes high, tiling mountainsides, springboards.
The volume of image of small format "badefreuden" is a worthwhile report of 190 pages in the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of welfare historic, it certainly gives desire to take a leap in the blue.
The art-collecting meder found remarkable copies during its research in Hungary.
Alongside the baths of welfare splendid as the bath Ltd in Budapest 100 years old, it was water containing natural in a cave in the karst (bath of cave in miskolc-tapolca) and a bath of spas by the basins filled with water containing the alkali and (városi termálfürdö in jászberény) and within a building in form of bottle.
By contrast, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria appears to have any dramatic views while, on the roof of the bath in Zurich was the entire city to her, you can admire the Arlberg earth-shaking changes from an external swimming pool of the snow-capped St. Anton: the Turkish bath has a window from which to observe the animation on the ski trail.
Perhaps the most extraordinary of swimming pool design looked swimmers in längenfeld: the Aqua dome ötztal resembles a ovni who has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam amounts of three open shelves, while in the background are the ötztal mountains to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not come from all the pools meder collection.
Many thermal baths are a smell of sulfur, árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong smell of oil, it is hard to believe, would be a health SPA.
The smell is therapeutic alkaline water containing hydrogen carbon that is almost black, and Limon you glue to the skin as soon as you let slide into the swimming pool, SPA experience special.
During its pursuit of beautiful swimming pools, IRIS meder has also suffered disappointments: when she wanted to visit ADB luhatschowitz free external, a swimming pool and outdoor of Czechoslovakia, it was faced with a ground blockaded.
The bath designed by the architèque Dusan jurkovic in 1902 was meanwhile closed.
By casting a glance out the window of the immeuble-art again in rouge-blanc-jaune, she noted the growth of weeds between tiles.
It was a charming effect in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palace of baths of ADB wildbad.
The building has already survived three phases; not only elements can be discovered néo-romains leaving since its conception in 1844 but still a Moorish Hall in Alhambra style that has been added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization of 1995, the Palace thermal bath remains the favorite of wet expert, IRIS meder - and not just because she is from schwarzwald.
"This is already a nice return than to merge construction styles so different in a unit so wonderful," said meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Speculation agricultural
The German Bank examined in detail the speculation on the raw
Of Christian teevs
The German bank abandonne-elle his speculation on raw materials?
According to information from spiegel-online, Josef Ackermann has established a working group to explore the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the Group would then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, this is clear: according to a survey, 84 percent of Germans find unacceptable that banks speculating on the raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two thirds of those surveyed even require that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinuent this avenue of cases because it adds to the problems of the world's poorest.
It is the result of a Forsa investigation regarding the organization of consumers Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann said in the article that the scholarships commodities speculation overall, drives prices high and that the banks share a complicity with global hunger.
The campaign to protect consumers with concrete action against the Chief of the deutsche-bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the major banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Act in the same way.
Speculation on the raw materials was originally introduced to protect dealers against price fluctuations.
But meanwhile, the majority of experts share the opinion that the gamblers had emerged of tenders and request - and benefit at the expense of very poor.
Ackermann reacts to the critical differently from American competitors: he promised to investigate the accusations and said, "nothing is worth risking the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
According to information from the Spiegel online an International Working Group is currently investigating accusations of foodwatch-report.
The review should be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Board of Deutsche Bank should be presented - with recommendation, usually.
Late January, the head of the Bank will indicate the implications.
It could result in a reduction of the commodities market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann built his image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo bode has welcomed the news, but at the same time has confirmed its criticism of the financial sector: "speculation on the increase of food prices in a draconian, shows how the banks today detrimental to the public interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby today to be particularly under obligation.
"Deutsche Bank should remove all of its portfolio investments, for which of the money has been spent on food speculation" said bode.
"It matters little, for Mr Ackermann, if it was a question of people starving or if Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
The awareness of Ackermann may seem surprising, at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the Group would present a picture perfect, a few months before he left office.
Deutsche Bank was announced Monday that the President would not affect what is planned within the Governing Council.
Ll could improve its image with an abandonment of the controversial agricultural speculation.
And on any losses, he has little to deal with - his successor is really.
One in two résilierait investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain pressure on the manager.
So far more than 30 million users have already participated in the campaign to the Organization.
Bode has published a poll Tuesday, with which the 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has carried out questionnaires to 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimizes that Deutsche Bank proposed investments for Paris on food prices.
Many bank customers would also of personal consequences if they learned that their Bank participates in such operations: one on two résilierait, following the poll, all money for investments, which is injected into the speculation on the raw materials.
43 percent déconseilleraient of such a bank around them, 49 per cent said they were working on the termination of their account for change "banking institution.
21st home in Vienna
The flag, which moved
Of Ingeborg wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a happy ending: the Austrian flag for the global exhibitions of Brussels in 1958 (prizes, has been a museum in Vienna, remained empty, then fell in ruins.
Now it is to reopen in place of House of exposure.
If there is enthusiasm for a postwar modern architecture to its clear forms, its hangars in glass, its strong and bold shapes and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in the technical progress, then the flag of the Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 in is a good and famous example.
The flag of schwanzer was once the "architecture" for its Grand Prix construction steel and glass, slight and suspended.
The construction is considered up to our days as an important step in the contemporary architecture.
He has made the architects if celebrities, it has also built the Austrian flag for the universal exhibition next.
With its legendary home in four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in form of BOL in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
Its draft flag as a temporary construction had been briefing after Swiss Expo in the garden at the station south of Vienna, has been transformed, and in 1962, a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was not physically and technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang the works of art, not a good environment.
However, it has been so long used, until the contemporary art gets a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and has increasingly dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf krischanitz has transformed the flag, it now carries the name of "house of the 21st century" in the future, and will be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedere Palace Museum opened, which makes the House, the first exhibition, a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The start has been completed by Agnes husslein-arco, which has become the new Director of the Austrian gallery in 2007 Belvedere.
Husslein-arco, has promoted an art historian with a significant career between other in his youth of patineuse artistic, subsequently Sotheby's home, the Guggenheim Museum and as Founding Director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, particularly in many alterations to the politicians and the protection of monuments, it has secured funds public and private sponsorship and established the exploitation.
Except for the contemporary art, works of the sculptor Fritz wotruba including the foundation bearing the same name have been exposed, a coffee and a bookshop is found, and an office must be built.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the achievement krischanitz was the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that the flag was "an extremely important position" place where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original plan, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness following his trip to Vienna and its change of use.
During the current changes, there were major problems: the building "was" an abyss in energy, "said krischanitz.
The profiles of window glass facades were changed, the insulating glass fibre reinforced glass was laid and the roof replaced by a particular safety glass.
The girder thermal bridges have been built or replaced, and coatings filled with asbestos have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a space screen light retained between home and road lighting, provides a bridge leading to the entrance, it is almost a new construction, but always the slight flag schwanzer.
The outside doors of origins are gone, the House is painted in a protection against rust hue of colour rouge-brun.
And the cinema is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all under close supervision by competent authorities for monuments and a small budget.
"often cheaper materials that are good and should be found, and that also appeal to the Office of the monuments' protection, said krischanitz and drew attention to a gross floor.
Despite all the problems, the constraints and transformation, the edifice was flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the flag, "which came from Brussels," said krischanitz recently, a typical story of "drop-in-the-city."
Such a structure is "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "awaken the good conscience."
But in this case, the home of the 21st century is in the wrong place, because if it is a stroke of luck for urban construction: around the garden Switzerland is precisely the "district of the central station" any newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another stroke of luck might happen: the home of the 21st century could benefit from the support of another construction krischanitz, because the art-collecting Francesca von Habsburg Berlin has purchased the temporary Art Centre, and as he said, it is already negotiating with the city for a site in the vicinity of the Swiss garden.
Bahn plans a fixed winter crisis in million.
The railway company has developed a plan-crise, which aims to prevent the train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the battle against the train accidents related to the winter season and the delays, the Deutsche Bahn Railroad Corporation "in this regard will be spent more than 70 million more this year.
The newspaper Bild "-zeitung reported earlier, citing a plan-crise internal group, as a total investment of about 300 million euros will be provided until 2015.
This would allow an increase in the availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of severe weather conditions.
The number of employees to the internal and external snow of railroads and waterfronts should, among other double and move to 16,000 people.
The goal is to transform the docks of the snow and ice until the early stages of service and 90 per cent of the necessary equipment to track the Service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, the head of the station grube warned the government and industry at a summit conference of train accidents occurred also this winter.
Last winter, the railway company has had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks one of reserves in case of severe weather conditions.
That is how many new regional trains have been waiting for years for a permit from the Ministry of Railways.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years of what to do, since it has to check the axles of ICE trains more often to the workshop, after a break of axles took place on an ice in the railway station in Cologne.
The German bank Deutsche Bank "paying millions of penalties on USA.
After the chief Josef Ackermann case there is something new in America: the German bank Deutsche Bank "shall be fined S" to the tune of millions.
As if the Deutsche Bank's problems were not enough, the past of this giant grabs the sector in the US: the Institute of Frankfurt payroll in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to resolve a problem due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is for the purchase of mortgage documents.
The financial markets regulator now-closed provides the major banks a range of charges, and is expected to encourage cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they minimized the risks.
These documents have lost a great deal of value during the financial crisis and have led the banks to the bottom.
"We are satisfied, they were unable to find a solution to this issue, without the parties begin proceedings in court," said a partner of the Deutsche Bank in New York.
The Bank has not been acknowledged by comparison of fault.
The same applies to the Citigroup, which agreed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of now-closed Debbie Matz hosted concessions of the two banks.
The National Credit Union administration (now-closed of cooperative banks of us and it has been operating in bankruptcy cases, in order to protect the customer deposits.
The now-closed tries to repair the damage incurred by several billion dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The Governor has taken a number of other major banks to party and in the summer it was summoned before the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In regard to the issue of mortgage documents it is of "mortgage-backed securities'.
The houses of credit in.
When the American housing bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September, on top of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers has been scrapped.
Although the events occurred a couple of years, American banks at the moment we breath a wind storm.
Investors and regulators have filed numerous complaints to redress or punishment for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (fhfa) sparked the biggest wave of complaints.
It criticizes 18 major international banks, the two financial state of the housing Americans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to benefit in nature on cases of mortgages of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also must file an appeal with the fhfa, referring to several operations for a total of 14.2 billion dollars in the years 2005 to 2007.
Regulators are asking, for the Frankfurter answer of "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as unjustified and said you could defend itself.
Warren Buffett increases by 10 billion among IBM
Buffett, the guru of the finance, pouring funds into the company Ti of IBM.
Since March, he has purchased the stock valued at more than $10 billion.
So far the largest American investor Warren Buffett is constantly do not invest in companies computer Ti, given that the long-term development of companies did not show that bad forecasts.
However, he read the reports of IBM and changed its opinion on the investment in this sector.
It had already understand much sooner than IBM's essential aim of computer systems and services for the sectors it to other companies.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as an attack of Knight in the world of finance.
Therefore the activity Ti IBM gives itself the right to call themselves now IBM tsar.
As Buffett has revealed today to release economic CNBC, he has bought since March of IBM shares with a value of $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett has said that IBM has never knew nothing of this commitment so far.
He commended the leadership, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable profits.
"you did a super job," said Buffett strategically.
IBM set for some time on the lucrative services Ti as "exploitation of accounting centres.
The pioneer of the computer, which is more than 100 years old, offers both software and consultation and highly successful business computers.
Buffett had so far rather avoided the technology companies.
He said that invests only in companies that it includes cases.
But Buffett is the rather frêt railway, to manufacturers of lubricants or machines.
Its holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as units from a variety of large groups such as Coca-Cola and the Munich Re, the ex rück Munichites.
This 80-year-old of 81 years had resumed in the 1960s "early textile enterprise Berkshire Hathaway and had erected on top of one of the world's most prestigious companies, thanks to smart investments.
However his lifestyle is modest.
That is why it is a cult figure to many investors around the world.
Its almost unerring sense to earn money earned him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett's investment actions IBM increased by one percent in the stock market.
"Big Blue," as it is called as IBM, has a market value of a total of more than 220 billion dollars and with Apple and Microsoft ranks among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
For Microsoft, said Buffett, he does not want to participate.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the so-called zwickauer cell "the Turkish media about the state of German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody" ideology, to be new to this.
The killings of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following that announcement, Turkey, as well as the Turkish-German population meeting reacts with fear and anxiety.
As many germano-turcs the spectrum has long thought dead reared its ugly head: since the inflammatory attacks of mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there was more violence comparable with the context of right-wing extremist against the Turks.
There is a xenophobia in Germany, it has never been discussed.
The network of right-wing extremist identified with, however, reveals the proportions which is far from being predictable.
"This is a return to the bloody ideology '," was the title of the publication on the Internet Turkish daily "haberturk."
The newspaper Sabah "stresses, however, that one of the authors is said to have been a v-homme of the protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities might be involved in the quagmire of extremists.
It is a reasoned that the Turkish community in Germany have responded: she called this weekend in a silent commemoration to victims of racial violence in the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks ago that the Turkish community of Berlin and the German political and Turks have thought at a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the recruitment agreement germano-turc.
It is with gay that cohabitation in pornography, symbolizing a story of success.
The reports of some Turkish media are a slap effect: "the gift of Germany for the 50th anniversary," that is the title of an article in the Platform turque- "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of killings.
The German also published "Hürriyet" has no compunction to draw clear conditions.
"it begins to puer" was the title of the Chronicle of Ahmet külahci.
He pointed out that people have been murdered, allegedly paid taxes and have provided by their work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The police action was seen as very critical about forums germano-turcs and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
 Why he is not come much earlier to the spirit of the German authorities to search suspect in some quarters of the extreme right wing, is a surprise authors.
Many people are willing to at least drastic means rhetorical even: "If the case continues to be botched, the only option left to migrants nothing other than self-defense and arming."
"It will be the best self-defense."
"The inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writing "selen."
What it means if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have illustrated.
The photograph of the ruins after the burning of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory German and Turkish.
Since no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a credible threat, and Germans, on which the mistrust and the distance by acts of violence could result.
However, the attacks have intensified the feeling of the US in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Once it is especially the failure of German policy after the attacks that the Turkish press complained: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of mölln.
After the burning of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if the value of a man could be assessed on its tax burden.
The current report of Turkish media shows once again how many germano-turcs is deep's mistrust of the state of local law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a further clarification and reassessment of the right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is necessary in this case.
The Bank scandal in Lake Zurich
The Bank most adventure of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina meanwhile from one crisis to another.
It was a German who now must work.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his departure from the head of the Bundesbank, learned in July that it would in 2013, a post almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the great Swiss Bank UBS, which was a major step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly welcomed, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its strength recently obtained and conveyed kind of comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS had achieved the turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."
And yet, by the month of September, it was clear that everything would change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had diverted all security systems of the Bank and had jumped around 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the Council of Administration of the UBS Oswald grübel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is seen as suffering from - and all ask: when Axel Weber is finally?
We have already learned that Weber may be advised of the Bank in February, 2012.
And it will resume the executive presidency already in May - not by 2013, as has been reported by the Bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that becomes difficult.
It is not a banker, much more Professor of economy and President of the Bank, and it would certainly have needed an adjustment period.
In one fell swoop we assume the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has still to prove once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest bank in Europe" scandal.
Indeed, on the one hand the UBS is enormous, until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it patina for years from one scandal to another.
Nothing, it seems, has spared the so proud Swiss bank.
It began during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss manager of assets, silent and solid, but crafty, she had combined with the ambitious goals: it also wanted to be, in the area of investment banking, a very large bank.
Therefore the UBS operated on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money from wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
In addition, it came as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.
This made sense.
The former banker Hans Geiger and later a professor of for many years in Zurich Bank says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good Bank before my students'.
"In the current context, the question is: how do I could simply wrong to me?"
It was deeply wrong.
In 2007, it appeared for the first time that something was amiss at UBS.
In the middle of the year the President Peter wuffli withdrew in surprising ways, which was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a terrific banker.
A few months later it was questioned why he was gone.
The Division of the Bank had soared with the sub-prime documents and to give up billion.
To support this, UBS announced a capital increase of $13 billion francs and made a cross over.
For this she was actually found investors, but who, shortly before, reportedly among eyebrows: a background of Asian State non-transparent from Singapore and a background of Arab State, which was ignored, to the point that no one has ever even heard his name.
However, this is the first shot.
In April it has worsened.
The Bank was to announce new losses amounting to billions, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees Marcel ospel, still in 2006 the second Executive Council the better pay of Switzerland, to resign.
In October, the disaster followed: the UBS was, given its errors, investment in the financial crisis before the crash and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank has bought at the UBS tens of billion of securities issues, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for in convertible bonds, for which it might become co-owner of the Bank.
Throughout Switzerland has been shaken - because she noted how this could be disastrous for a small country, to host such large banks.
Finally, the total assets of the UBS 2007 S "rose to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We could not save the UBS once again," said the researcher at banks, Geiger.
After the first disaster as a follow-up to the second.
Already a few months before, UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with the United States and has agreed to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who defrauded the tax, perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it has accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine plus.
And the UBS has more or less published it helped to tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital to compete with the rich clients: the prestige of the discretion.
After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
He followed the withdrawal of the head of the Governing Council and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees.
And the exodus of customers' money.
And in a few months, the Bank had lost its credibility in the two main business: investment banking sectors because of bad speculation and asset management because of tax evasion.
And, as there was somewhat a return to calm, and as had been thought, that UBS would manage, he followed in this unfortunate history of merchants of title: a single trader in a flaming 1.7 billion euros, before the bank not to understand that something was amiss.
And being published: with risk management in investment bank that still does not seem to work.
"with the case Adoboli, it was found that the risks to too little," said Martin Janssen, economist and Professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
As the chief financial officer of a major German bank is safe: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not have" the risks.
However, it was precisely the idea of caution, with which the Swiss Bankers had long taken office, that to become caretaker of the world's great fortune: not too much risk, but the security for the money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of an entrenched reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a chocolate worthy.
The Central of the UBS in Zurich goes hand in hand with the strong metaphor of the Swiss Bank closed - it is only a little larger.
Already the classic situation is.
The Bank has its headquarters at the railway station in Zurich, which led directly to the central station at Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped mountain Swiss.
The buildings are here, the rental stores are among the highest in Europe.
The jewellers as tiffany' S, midway between the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
Swiss Bankers have lived here for centuries: of the National Bank to the Palais du Credit Suisse to private banks elitist as Julius bär.
You arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, before there were thick leather chairs, and alongside the logo of the Bank, a major label for "safe."
The UBS knows the customer research here: security.
The idea of the Swiss bank was eventually rejected the contract, or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank to find.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, indeed all Swiss Bankers it also does business with the two major banks.
The UBS became far too high, trouve-t' it - especially in investment banking, where there were also reports the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss do not have nothing more to say.
"Even so, they have long been adapted to the morals of Anglo-Saxon."
Indeed, this was the Anglo-Saxon which had changed the UBS investment bank, it made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the jungle of sub-prime like Swiss bank.
The disaster has become apparent on 15 October 2008.
"on Wednesday the government coalition of small countries to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," the author Lukas hässig wrote in his book "the crash of the UBS '.
With up to 68 billion francs, is approximately 45 billion euros, the politicians have agreed to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we spoke with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem mainly to the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks have reached a huge group.
A bank, which was already too large for the little Switzerland - and has consistently recorded an increase.
What has helped is that the two banks prédécesseuses different from the UBS Bank completed: a rich, but in lethargy with strong point asset management in Zurich and already a poorer, but increasingly internationalized.
Suddenly, the international investment banks have been positively access to plenty of money, with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS Group, and Marcel ospel, formerly President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought that wuffli and ospel was a dream team," said the researcher at banks, Hans Geiger.
"wuffli, the great intellectual modest, which are very well in models and statistics, and ospel, the intuitive, blazed a path to the Summit with the learning of the Bank."
But ospel has relied until the end to wuffli.
Wuffli and probably would have committed a crucial error at the end: "he thought that his models were the reality," said Geiger.
"It is tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: the exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS remembers clearly the Leaders' meetings at which the head of the Group wuffli was always the same motto: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The US Bank Investment Bank was the most powerful in the world.
It has ordered the "league tables" rankings, at that time, that have documented the success of banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to climb to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded him.
In case of currency and stock transactions it has played a very important role.
The advisers, who had the responsibility, however, have stressed a weakness: in the operations of international banking interests, in the jargon "fixed income," there would be a huge difference from the biggest banks.
The UBS would have gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS was embarking on an adventure, which has nearly cost him his life.
Hungry for growth, it is both the Bank itself and a core of investment management created before it in the sub-prime Americans who have invested.
It was transformed into a massive machine that was packed and put the valuable papers based on mortgages Americans - but who has also retained the risks.
Even when other banks have long sought to disembark.
"yet in the summer of 2007, while the US housing market was in flames, the UBS bought here," said Geiger, a banking expert.
The larger the euphoria is over the fall is brutal.
A manager after another has left, when to stop attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
The posts in UBS became ejectable and are so far bancaux.
The leader of the major bank has a nearly impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, to which all business models suggested have disappeared.
The researcher, Geiger Bank already has an idea: an end to the investment bank, concentration in the property management, return to Swiss roots.
But the Bank does not (yet) so far.
But the Investment Bank must vigorously atrophy, as is clear so far.
Next Thursday the Bank chief Sergio ermotti wants to present to the world its future strategy.
The Italian-Swiss age 51 was only supposed to be on an interim basis when the Bank was separately with surprise of his predecessor grübel.
Meanwhile, it has emerged: it must sustain the affairs of the UBS, reported Tuesday the Bank in Zurich.
Ermotti wants to make the investment bank in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But it is not sufficient.
The UBS needs a vision.
Which is it?
With which to make money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber was certainly already raised.
He said so far only publicly that it would try with his wife an apartment in Zurich.
The next year.

The smart corneilles spread to cities
In many places, rooks are regarded as "problem birds." But experts say that these very intelligent animals are no longer hunt cities.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible the corneilles belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities residents' complaints are increasing because of the dirt and the noise of animals.
An antidote to the "N problem of birds" is not yet in sight.
In the first ostfriesisch symposium on the corneilles, experts have said that it is no longer possible to drive the rooks cities.
The experts from throughout Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in the cities
The patrons of the nature makes the problems of cities also on the exodus of rooks special protection: the use of agricultural chemicals destroy more of the traditional living space.
Hunting, development and logging of evidence typical made life difficult for birds.
The corneilles are under the protection of nature.
There was a big settlement with more than 600 pairs of evidence in the westfälischen SOEST, in the northwest, including jever, diepholz and Achim near Bremen, in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project won negative advertisements as a result of the slaughter of corneilles in this region.
Critics have found the capture of birds in traps and killing them with clubs particularly brutal.
"the expulsion order, the exclusion, serves no purpose," noted the planner for the city and the landscape of LEER, Werner klöver.
The destruction of the nests of the water pressure or felling trees, often produce unintended consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of lahr Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are losing, the large settlements were and they move on to other places."
The drive is possible only in exceptional cases as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer" them.
The problem is not resolved in the cities without the inclusion of the outskirts, according to the opinion of the Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of the ousting of animals to a conditioning aversif and offers accrocheuses, to enable them to relocate.
Psychologist and ethnologist, UTA Maria Jürgens prospectait "billboards with Info in place of chainsaws completely different" to establish relations with the final: "We can better withstand button in the face with a dose of confidence."
Jürgens has co-fondé the ascheberger-cheminement-éducatif of baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing on the lives of the rooks, very intelligent.
The project has since been adopted by the tourists.
World Meteorological gave his own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a great number of communication, these oiseaux-là have much to say."
The intelligence and ability of animals are legendary: the rooks do not use only instruments to work to reach a pleasing but they produce their own tools as instruments of work.
The éthologistes of Cambridge University tested four rooks recently, how come the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds learn quickly that they overwhelm a shaky with stones in order to achieve a larva.
Without much training, they recognize déterminément that a stone must have some size and shape for to unravel the platform.
In a second test, the clever corneilles needed to solve a problem more trapu.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The Birds could not reach their spoils with their tooth.
However, the researchers were available pieces of wire to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they were catching small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four successful rooks the same from the start.

The mass slaughter of staff
The new book by Peter Englund provides depth and générosité. titled "the beauty and the Council: an intimate history of the First World War" (the beauty and sorrow: an intimate history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of characters that you greenhouse the heart.
A Council to begin: tear up carefully this page and do your marque-page.
You will hear about them in detail in this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon in those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be disturbed and desperate in the mists of the war.
Peter Englund is a historian and journalist Swedish.
It is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for literature.
He wrote a book out of the ordinary that he describes, with accuracy, as "a work of anti-histoire."
It has some important treaty known names, or the famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion on strategies and equipment.
It is not so much a book on what happened, because, as a "book outlining how it could look like it reflected the" feelings, impressions, experiences and moods ."
"the beauty and sorrow" summarizes the experiences in time of war of 20 men and women more or less normal, on both sides of the war, young schoolgirls and botanistes to escaladeurs, doctors, paramedics and sellers.
Some become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some will lose members become insane or lives.
Their lives reeling here as the candles of a church: while some are exhausted, new ones are in conflict.
The book by Peter Englund deviated from the traditional history books.
It gives the lie to the idea that the First World War is only by the terrible war on the western front.
"the beauty and sorrow" cleverly described other theatres of war: the Alps and the Balkans, the Eastern Front, the Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under the hives; a spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
The war permeates the lives of these people such a natural disaster such as a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of the cordite.
When cannon shots ringing from afar, and that you are a mother at home, are you staying or fuyez-vous?
That will come from anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons for the war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of evidence has been augmented by the assumptions, hopes and fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"the beauty and sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard stumpf, a young marine of the German High Sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly from memos, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are more preserved through the accumulation of small, isolated moments and details.
Most view the deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"coffee of replacement, false aluminium, imitation of rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It continued on the food of replacement in Germany.
He described the "meat made of rice cooked sheep crushed in fat (and finished with a false bones of wood); tobacco manufactured from dry skin and dried roots of potato;" wooden shoe soles.
He claims that "837 alternative meats are registered in the production of saucisses. also 511 cafes of alternative."
Some stories are entering the honour and courage.
An American recognizes its own impulse to the savagery and says about the war: "you feel that, after all, that is what the men were targeted, rather than sitting in a comfortable Chair, a cigarette and a whisky by hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and instead of pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there was no barbaric behind your shirt empesée and cloutée.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that nobody will notice or not pay attention.
"when one is resigned to make sacrifices, we hope to have a public" he writes.
Unfortunately, this is not comparable to "a condemned man strangled in secret."
Other comments relate the decline of an old and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming more and more a matter of economic competition" writing Peter Englund, "a war between the factories.
It took the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiaire at the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well-written and convinced ideologically, clothes well cut, which serves his butchery while seated behind a counter."
People Act in unexpected ways, all of that base of heroism.
Peter Englund spoke of soldiers who tried to grab a venereal disease among prostitutes in order to avoid it at the front.
"This is the most ridiculous in the trade of pus due to the gonorrhea, that the soldiers buy and run for the body into the hope to finish at the hospital," he writes.
"The more desperate the applicable to the eyes, resulting in a blindness to life '.
In this translation of Swedish by Peter gross, the prose of Peter Englund is flexible, but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to the task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, it takes the way the war has "unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution," an aversion to the religion.
People start to wonder why they are a war.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, as "the great war and modern memory" (the Great War and modern memory) by Paul fussel, or "a West nothing new," Erich Maria remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's book is a little conventional Pantheon.
The end of the book is the worse I have read in a work non-fictionnelle.
I can't divulge.
But it is as if he had emerged from his book, in your hands this page containing the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first step in the wrong direction, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some dressed in riot helmets.
During the night of Monday to Tuesday was chosen as the zuccotti stock would be empty.
The operation remained secret for all except for a few senior officers and others informed early on that they would proceed with an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, its presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of "episodes in recent weeks, as the use of pepper spray against demonstrators, which went against the Department's regulations and have generated a storm of public solidarity with the protesters.
The operation to clean up the Park zuccotti's demonstrators were deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The S "were prepared by observing the proceedings of occupations in other cities.
A crucial year was held on the island of Randall, in view of the operation at the Park zuccotti.
The police officers were better training against the riots, anti-terrorist measures moving large numbers of police quickly - to concentrate on the section of lower Manhattan.
The last session was held Monday evening, the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders for travel in the park have reached "at the last minute," said a resigned, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"the few that I know who police were called unaware that they surrender zuccotti at the park," said the person anonymously.
"The only that they would be at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city has attracted a lesson, hence the secrecy of the operation.
The 14 last October, police wanted to clean up the park but were postponed by hundreds of demonstrators informed of plans.
Tuesday's operation involving police officers of various units, including operational forces of the entire district, dozens of officers accustomed to communities particularly criminals.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were in the park during the day and went barbarically, in the manner of; an hour of the morning was a supportive schedule.
"this should take place when the park were the least of people" he said.
Emergency services vehicles capable of running and loudspeakers gathered to pipe slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the bridge of Manhattan before acting.
The lights and resounding recorded message of loudspeakers have seemed intimidated the demonstrators.
While the Community Affairs officers entered the park with their coupe-vent light blue, many demonstrators have simply put together their cases and have left.
No attempt was hit before 1h45 said the police, leaving time for residents to collect their belongings.
Other teams of police officers had been sighted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if the arrests were needed.
Journalists present at the Park have been forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the head of the Police Department spokesman, said that the action had been taken by security.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from seeing the intervention in the park, hard selected by the officers.
Browne said that truckloads of television cameras on church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved west across the thick undergrowth of demonstrators, including the luggage, the turf in foil and plastic bags filled with clothes, teams from the Department of sanitation, cleaning everything that follow the occupants left behind.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave were traînés. images have been broadcast on the Internet.
The largest group of demonstrators took place near the camp kitchen, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier as police moved to arrest methodically.
About a dozen people at the epicentre of the settlement have clung together.
Finally, two persons were shackled to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut locks.
There have been no arrests in the park before 3h30 Mr Kelly said.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most for "disturbing public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, Chief of the Police Department, is the highest ranking official to be found on the premises.
Phil T. Pulaski, the Department's Chief of detectives, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although this, "does not lead the operations," said Browne.
A second group of policemen patientaient along the east side of the park, between liberty street and cedar Street, in case of need.
The barricades were put on cortlandt street, a block of houses north of the park, as well as on pine street in the South.
It was the police widen the circle far beyond the Park zuccotti.
Several officers, most equipped with shields, have even been seen pushing people to limit.
About 28 people were on the northern side.
One of the most serious of the night took place in South Park.
To 5h00, south of pine Street, one protester jumped on the weight of a police car other were observed puncture the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The Union of school aid continues the city for redundancies
The Union, which represents hundreds of school aid having lost their jobs last month plans to file a lawsuit against the City Wednesday to layoffs and unnecessary; the disproportionate impact is on the schools for disadvantaged students.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the Union, 37th District Council, to try to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred seventy school aid, coordinators of parents and other employees, part of the city's less well paid, have lost their jobs last October 7 Union leaders are compared these dismissals in a political campaign for not letting the city access to a fund for health care led by groups of workers, and would have allowed to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have strongly denied the accusation.
At a hearing of the City Council last month, the Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that the dismissals were a part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that the dismissals of school aid was "not specified in the budget.
The officers of the 37th District Council have said they meet a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the proceedings on the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the City Department of Education will form the party défenderesse. plaintiffs will be represented by eight laid-off women workers, all in black or Hispanic origin, like most educational AIDS who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the city's Legal Department, said that the municipality has still not been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore could not comment on the allegations.
According to an outline of complaints received by the New York Times, the Union backing on the number of layoffs in the schools in the poorest areas of the city to support its claim against unfair treatment, declaring that the poor schools would lose the most aid because of a regular underfunding.
While there are no termination on Staten Island, and some to death in Upper East side or tribeca, 17 school aid have lost their jobs in the 23rd district of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th district of southern districts of the Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aid on eight employees at the public school 36 of Harlem, where 68 per cent of students living in poverty, the prosecution said that "this is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can lead of funds to close the budget deficit."
The budget for the "public school 36 had been reduced from 3.26 percent this year, the funds have also been lost when the city has changed its calculation of the additional funding for each entry to disadvantaged students.
The Union also claims that senior managers have been misled by some words in a memo that the dismissal of coordinators of the parents.
The memo used the term "overrun" to describe the action, even though "overrun" describes more generally the action of a school teacher in a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the Central Office.
According to the draft of complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed," and "not only because they have exceeded."
Mission: Congress reaches an agreement on the question of Libya
Ultimately, it appears that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have reached an agreement on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and killing of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (- Massachusetts democrat, with Republican Senators John McCain (- Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent, Connecticut, applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is to honour the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"This is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been easy to date.
This summer, legislators of both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the development of several resolutions to approve or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain have submitted a resolution to allow the limited use of American military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide margin bipartisan and has never been the subject of a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day of the failure of the bill, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce funding for American operations in Libya.
The US Mission is therefore remained under a form of purgatory legislature - the Congress upset enough to criticize the management of the Mission by Obama, but not enough to pull the rug from under the feet.
The indecision of the Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli was killed by insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20 last year.
The NATO mission was officially completed on October 31.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Foreign Relations Committee "commends the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination in view of freedom" and "commends the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and its coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their courage and professionalism" fantastic.
The resolution also says "the national interest of the United States to reach an irreversible and successful transition to democracy" in Libya.
The new measure remportera-t-elle all the support of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee or divisera-t-elle legislators as in June?
The Senator and Chairman Richard D. Lugar (independent) opposed to the latest version.
His spokesman said on Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of new project.
In the Capitol, the House will vote this week a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all congressional Republicans, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by the Republican Bob goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on budget, or any other issue, to obtain a floor vote in the House or the Senate.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in Congress, on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed in both the House and the Senate, and others are small variations of a precedent.
There are at least 15 only to the House versions of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful to "control the federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their support - including the new Republicans who want to gild their CV - the chance to claim to be "The author" of such a measure.
The Law on the control of the budget (budget control act passed last August requested the vote of the House and Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution endorsing the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress may serve, while Jose E. Serrano (Democrat, New York) want to lift the limit of two terms for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to a quality education and health care, among other topics.
An amendment prohibiting marriages between people of the same sex is perpetually offered, as the amendment banning desecration of the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two-thirds of the States are opposed to it.
As eager as the members to offer amendments, they are not as fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators have proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed in the early 1990s, when members generally offer more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they did not have much more success than they have today.
The last to be added - the 27th amendment, ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"sword but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords television in his first interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man she was shot at close range in Tucson, the Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) started Monday evening in a televised broadcast, sang "the sun will come out tomorrow" to Broadway and says he wants to be restored rather than return to Congress.
During his appearance with the television "20 / 20" on ABC, with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords has struggled for form sentences and needed help to walk.
The issue took up his return difficult after the ball which was fractured his skull and tore the left side of the brain, across the head.
Three months ago, she had made a surprise return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang, and described his restoration of "difficult."
After that Diane Sawyer asked him how it felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, replied "rather good."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, the astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of "20 / 20," the eve of the release of the couple's new book entitled "gabby: a story of courage and hope.
The "special traced the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords since the shooting incident on January 8.
In videos shot by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, sees it from his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
It manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sits in a wheelchair while doctors to learn to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of lips.
And finally, the first word: "what."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords has whispered another word ("toast") to seek to change the menu of his breakfast.
The video broadcast by ABC show the important role of the music in the restoration of Gabrielle Giffords: there is she going to sing with the doctors air of cyndi lauper "girls' Wanna have fun" and Tom petty "free fallin '?."
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours a day with the doctors, has said that he does not recall of the shooting.
According to her husband, it was to read an article on the shooting incident on March 12 when it has stopped and asked for the first time details of the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee loughner, has been detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treaty pending the trial.
"There were many deaths," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"hard, hard, hard."
During his recovery, said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten.
"so I would say," gabby, you have not been beaten, "said Mark Kelly.
You have just been massacred.
And you're going you break it, you restore and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity that respect for the troops
The event: a gala for Wall Street to reap millions of dollars for homeless veterans in the city of New York.
Kid rock sang ride on a failure, the frustration and the loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in costume-cravate began standing on its feet for the cheer.
"The soldiers, men and women, are regarded as heroes," said David 80 Saltzman, organizer of the collection of funds from the spring.
A military haut-gradé present at the gala, which was also the Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the armed forces of the United States, has given the role of the troops in different ways.
"They have been presented as a kind of orphan," the military haut-gradé wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But this was not just the respect of compassion.
The conflicting impressions absolutely illustrate the difficult relations that have installed between the military and a passionate American public but often distant.
The praise was urged to troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say a few soldiers.
The public is increasingly as if he was sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We do not have any of the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon.
"but it seems to be the only way to support us to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky minds."
It is a very sensitive issue for the military leaders, who do not seem grateful or in disagreement with the public they serve.
They also recognize that the anger of revenantes troops from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most of the conversations on the Mercy have rise in confidence among the veterans.
After the return of his two sons in the fight with the Marines, the retired Colonel mark Cancian has warned that the public would their service from two perspectives.
Some watching them with respect because they have been exposed to the insurgents and had travelled to distant lands.
Others will ask whether "a veteran angry and violent lurks beneath the surface" said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.
When seeking a job, he said, he felt that some individuals who were sending him the talks called for subtle way if he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from battle.
"When you raise the subject of the service, you have to negative impressions," said Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his son.
The military challenges, in part, from the American indifference towards the war.
The victories are rarely praise from a country as familiarity with the army, which sees little direct benefit of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"as a nation, we do value more heroism in the same manner as in the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of the politicians and the people focus largely on the depth of suffering of a soldier.
The troops have been recognized as the number of services endured periods, the number of lost friends or the extent of the injury.
The armed response to the growing pressure to clamp down on rapists
This week, a crucial hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction of rape.
If necessary, hundreds of plaintiffs preparing the next.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and a forum for 11 weeks the night where she was allegedly raped by a soldier.
C "was in October 2008, she returned to its barracks at Miramar air station, north of San Diego, after having had dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was a wake-up call," said Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texan has set aside its concern.
I thought, no, it was 19.
"It is in Texas," she said.
"I had to keep my intuition."
A few minutes after entering the house of Elizabeth Lyman, the man was caught from behind, ground and raped her, are they trying to.
This week, on November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and others not, anxiously wait the court ruling in a landmark trial to be conducted in Arlington, Virginia, and who will decide whether a trial against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not having stopped the spread of rape in the army, undercutting the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the trial involved initially 17 plaignants. that number increased to 28 the following month, 25 women and three men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow troops they also claimed that the army had not investigated, prosecuted or to provide justice adjusted after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke said attacking military galonnées, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure" cashflow.
"who are the people in a position to eradicate this culture of retaliation... the leaders'.
The lawyer also said that since February, it had been approached by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom would be part of future legal proceedings.
His strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs in this case, thus putting all its eggs in one basket, she pursue several trial, if necessary, to keep up the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, cover the strategy of the defense, and above all, the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in injury or not for service in the armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 to the Supreme Court, called the Feres doctrine, the Federal Government is not liable for injuries sustained by the staff in active service.
"the alleged ill is inherent in the military service of plaintiffs" the documents show.
The Defense Department has refused to make any comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While officially, women still do not have the right to go into battle, this distinction exists on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers women play an increasingly important role, including to come into contact with the local women.
Result: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers have lost their lives, two thirds in a combat situation.
It is time for the army to modernise said Susan Burke.
She is not alone in that fight: three other trials are under way in most of theirs.
A school of law at Yale, the centre of legal services of veterans is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynist.
In addition, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a lawsuit against the army, by focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively normally, according to the activists such as Anu bhagwaru branch Women's Action Network (military) Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.
The group filed a lawsuit in December at the veterans administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in the handling of claims for benefits for the people who say they were victims of a sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent of each other bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mixture of senators and representatives, providing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults have been recorded, according to the Centre for intervention and prevention of sexual assaults, sexual assault prevention and response agency) of the Department of Defense.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assault is sous-estimé. indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this represents approximately 13.5 per cent of 19,000 incidents this year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecution: in 2010, 20 percent of reported cases in the army have been brought to trial, with half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Susan Burke described their aggression as the first in a series of injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she informed the rape's military police less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, he was asked to tell 11 times in detail their rape at various police officers, doctors and commanders.
It suffered a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her attacker, due to a cut in his arms, was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April, Elizabeth Lyman is sitting before a magistrate in a trial in which she was asked about his sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of its aggression.
Six people have testified as character witnesses for the offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was delivered," said Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought that I would start to be contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commander" that was not his trial but mine "
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to a psychiatrist military, which came to diagnose a personality disorder, making it unfit for service.
In January, she was back on terms less than honorable, preventing him from receiving any advantage.
Is that the case Lyman and other plaintiffs will or not, it has been a long history, said John Turley, a law professor at the Law School of the University of Washington.
However, he said, "in my opinion, they should be able to proceed."
Only the doctrine of criticism since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I have always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because they do not have the same benefits and posed by means of deterring the responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it is important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not on their side, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, collect its hundreds of other plaintiffs in other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform," she says.
Where until it was still commonplace, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers you study on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just a guy as his anti-immigration views online.
Monday, Breivik, who has acknowledged having been taken by a murderous madness in Norway in July left 77 victims, faced his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being ready to Cyberspace: he had spent a lot of time prior to the attack on his computer, to talk to some of the millions of nationalists who support the right-wing groups on the web sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, the researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can they find?
Easy... connectez-vous Facebook.
"We realized that it was not all that difficult to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, principal author of a report published recently by the reflection group of demos on populism divide in Europe.
Facebook full of so many personal information, said Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool of the web to find the people they seek with scientific precision - the way the mercaticiens have been doing it for years.
The team of Jamie Bartlett has discovered that a million people are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe it has targeted them with advertisements, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the announcement encouraged users to respond to an inquiry, and the questions focused on their education, their attitudes to the violence, and their optimism about their own futures.
When they come in contact with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues have given 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the Office.
"This is a new way to do research," said Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising, all the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather than men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate activism online and off line are more sensible, more democratic and less severe than those who stay behind their computer screen."
The study of demos is just an example of how Facebook became the new indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
The focus groups, medical researchers and analysts use the web to address all the issues affecting the health issues, such as the social trends, with "I love," publications on the walls and updates of statutes.
With more than 800 million active users, which adds an average three content per day, the data "supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research the site's name appears in the title of almost 800 percent over the past five years.
To some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study of people you could not approach in the street.
"before, when you try to conduct background checks on people of the British National Party, it was" very difficult to identify them.
"you go to the party, but they never would have allowed to enter," said Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the Web could be a way of identifying and addressing the social and health problems.
According to a recent study by the D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, the young students who spoke on Facebook exploits of drunk were much more likely to be discreet beverages that students.
Megan Moreno suggests that members of students, such as the advisers, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status speaks too often with alcohol.
"You are not dealing with a problem if you do not diagnosed," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno, Director of the Center for Health, and development of children in the Research Institute for Children in Seattle, said the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify the children at risk, and that would be in another case not recognized."
Facebook also constant access to information of its users.
The team's website, which handles data has studied the statistics on the situation of love and St Valentine's Day, the participation rate in the mid-term elections by 2010 and a National Happiness index (thanks to information available only in digital - champions of freedom have long argued that the web can make available its trove of data to other people for research purposes).
But users of Facebook know that the web was watching, they like it or not, in exchange for power to play scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles away, the web is allowed access to your information.
But what happens when the users of Facebook are part of an investigation they have not even heard about?
While researchers have clear instructions on how to collect the information by means other than the Internet, it is anything online.
"I do not believe that a large number of users have already thought to the fact that a researcher can consider their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the Laboratory of knowledge of London, according to a study by 2006 with the walls Facebook's performance as its students.
"as far as they know, the exchanges were seen only by their friends'.
And then the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study to be completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to determine the extent of truth of a profile or on the wall of a user.
"what you say on Facebook and what you do in real life are two completely different things," says Neil Selwyn.
That is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn think a notebook and a pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"nothing can replace the real world and to the people," he States.
"the social studies are expected to address the social aspect, and the social, not at a computer."
"Cold and inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, was described as a "fighter of the resistance" in his first appearance at the trial taking place in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Frankish of Norway," well before a courtroom packed with 500 people.
"with regard to the jurisdiction of the Court, I repudiate it, because you want your mandate to organizations supporting an ideology of hate and because it supports multilateralism."
"I know the facts but I do not plead guilty."
The judge torkjel nesheim has suspended Breivik during this monologue because it "did not want to allow him the opportunity to use the trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, it refused to allow Breivik, who has brought with it a words on paper, talk to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
The judge nesheim has also asked the police to keep Breivik in 12 weeks longer detention, he was prohibited from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities were very nearly all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some had come in the hope of Breivik look in their eyes, others to be sure that it would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I thought it was cold and inhumane," said one survivor of utoya to the Norwegian television network NRK.
"" I was not comfortable with it, but I have some personal advanced after having seen and heard the suspect ."
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial he has looked into the eyes of the journalists and the survivors in entering and leaving the Court.
Despite the odd notion that Breivik belongs to a movement of "resistance," the judge has determined that it was mad not and he also said that there is no evidence that it has acted with accomplices.
The 22 July attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a whole group of radicals, perhaps in warm some.
But that does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred that it seems to be a monster, but that is not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 from the interview lost to Steve Jobs, to film this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 last October, some have compared to Henry Ford, marked by the technical genius and inventor of the modern computer.
But what apple fans may find more revealing in a maintenance of Steve Jobs found recently that will be published this week in the first part of a film on the main markets, is to what extent this creative spirit had come to understand the process and workflow products.
There was no doubt a creator and a rêveur. he identified with a hippie but was also very careful and held as a améliorateur of charts, a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from a "disease their suggesting that a clever idea was 90 per cent of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual labor between a brilliant idea" a product of emergency.
In 1995, Bob cringely developed the television series "triumph of the nerds" this series traces the birth of the computer, and it sits down for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, for about 10 years, Steve Jobs had to leave apple. he was already working hard on its new computer company next to a people's adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with cringely is used in nerds, he said that the main copies have disappeared in the carriage.
It was only after the death of Steve Jobs that full video is found in the garage of the filmmaker.
This video, rising slightly, is the basis for 68 minutes film Steve Jobs: the lost interview, which will be distributed to film next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating the in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to expose biography of technological and business strategies.
And incredibly carefully.
On four different points during the interview, the answers are a long time after the issues - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, in which Steve Jobs is clearly his thoughts, in order to give a precise answer.
We also discover moments when the been too perfectionist of Steve Jobs, reappearing where it seems anxious to hear the issues of cringely, kicked him to elbow for the move and moving on to larger issues or topics.
Filmed before the era of pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there is something oddly prescient on lost interview. Steve Jobs assesses what is good or bad for the other companies and its vision on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read the posthumous assessments of the career of Steve Jobs, but there is something gross and based on human rights that we see here, the dreamer anxious on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can be and should be.
They said later they put up implementing.
Here's a quick summary of seven remarkable clips of lost interview:
How he has learned to conduct business.
"during all these years, I have always asked: 'Why are you doing it?' and the answers are always the same: 'Oh, simply because" we need to make them.
Nobody knows why, nobody is thinking in depth with things in a company.
This is what I found.
Steve Jobs with details of continues its efforts to simplify accounting for apple.
Perplexed at how the costs were registered, it often begins with a "standard" estimated to cost to nose, then adjusted with a "variation," he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of business costs.
On the opportunity to play a round with the Pope.
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" that he has created with Steve Wozniak, a device used to hack into the telephone networks and telephone with free longue-distance.
The device has been the subject of numerous written in advance, but the euphoria of Steve Jobs here in his description of the blue box as an act of ownership is contagious.
He described how he and Wozniak had tested the box using a public telephone, through an appeal later by connecting to a network at & T to another while bypassing satellites as much as possible.
"We enveloppions of the different things a half-dozen times and you hurliez in the public telephone and you scored a minute later to the public telephone next door," explains jobs laughingly.
"we were young and through this blue box, we have learned that we can create something capable of controlling billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world."
We did not know anything about both, but we knew invent something capable of controlling of great deeds this incredible was a lesson, and I do not believe that apple would one day have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues in recounting a wonderful round that he and Wozniak have developed: he phoned the Vatican with the blue box in the middle of the night by trying to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned to the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices are crazy laugh just before the Pope himself was awakened.
On his love with technology (and canvassing for bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, hunting for spare parts to manufacture a fréquencemètre, it seeks the number of bill Hewlett in the Yearbook and a coat of it over.
Shortly after their conversation in 20 minutes, Steve Jobs get a summer job in part-time Hewlett-Packard.
"This has had a significant influence on I. It" was the only company that I had seen at that age and this formed my definition of a company and how employees are treated ."
Steve Jobs has subsequently become one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, based in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first laptop computer ever conceived.
It was as big as a suitcase, owned a small tube cathodique. I have fallen in love.
The adolescent that I was "HP returned home and began to write programs for the machine.
On the improvisation of innovation.
At several times in the interview, Steve Jobs spoke of inventing new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, when he moves to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asks him to assemble a complete computer.
Working at only 30 days of credit, it was to take care of the Assembly as well as the delivery of aircraft finished.
Later, Apple, he remembers the difficulties in developing a computer mouse.
"I remember big disputes... they shouted above me in claiming that it would take five years [to manufacture a mouse that cost $300). I have had enough, I left and went to see" a developer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could manufacture for $15 and which was incredibly reliable.
On the large companies that have lost momentum.
Long before it does revive apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders are wrong and losing control of their market share.
"suppose you work for IBM and Xerox, you made a clearer copier and printer, and after?
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company is not more than successful.
The sales and marketing can change, so [those types of people] that eventually run the companies and professionals in product are placed at the gap of decision-making.
The engineering in product that has led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine a good product from a bad product - the manual work required.
That is what happened in Xerox's...
Xerox could hold the whole computer industry.
It could have been 10 times its size, Xerox is alleged to be the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They snatched the defeat to the victory.
On innovation as a form of art.
"an awful lot of manual work between a brilliant idea of an exceptional product... as you develop this idea," it is changing and growing.
You learn much about its intricacies.
There is room for compromise... some things you can do, the electrons can, the glass, the robots, factories as well.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) assembling them.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal taste it is to try to give you the best products were created by men, and to try to make these things in the product that you create.
Picasso said that good artists and that copy the great artists fly.
We have always shame to steal good ideas.
This is partly what makes splendid Macintosh and the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologistes, historians, that simply turned the best scientific technology in the world.
If not for the computer science, they would have been extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health law while the Court meets
The day when the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the question of political discord, whether the President's opposition to the law Obama of health will be heard, two of the justices, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the firm of lawyers who defend the case before the High Court.
The event was last Thursday, when the nine judges gathered for a conference to discuss the petitions for review.
One case involved a lawsuit by 26 States challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for activists Conservatives nationwide.
The justices agreed to hear the complaint, in effect, a monumental argument of 5.30 is due in March next year, and the result will probably be conducive to the destabilization of the 2012 race, which will be in full swing at the time the Court's decision will be made.
The lawyer who will be held before the Tribunal and will argue on the rejection of the law, would likely Paul Clement, who served as Solicitor General of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clement, PLLC Bancroft, was among the two dozen firms have helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society (federalist society), a group of dedicated to defending the conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones day, represents one of the trade associations who have challenged the law, the National Federation of independent businesses, National Federation of independent business).
Another developer was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the dispute.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the Court's Conference on the matter.
Was there, among others, Mitch McConnell, top Republican declared the Senate and opponent of the law of health.
The flagship invited for dinner? scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were present to events of the federalist society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, the judges are exempt from code of conduct to govern the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they argumenteraient probably by the Code of Canon 4c, which states: "A judge can attend fund-raising organizations linked to law and other while the judge cannot be a speaker, a guest of honour, or on the programme of such an event."
However, the mere presence of scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two law firms of the case, as well as to a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of the Government Ethics.
"This violation of ethics and blissful indifference to the Code contradicted the statements of several judges that the Court adhere to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of common cause.
"The judges drank and were and to a gala fund-raising with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and their participation in the collection of funds for this event to dismantle any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas had shown little respect for the criticism that they mix too easily into the affairs of the Court with the agenda of groups such as the federalist society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a conservative activist from haut-profil.
In addition, the conservatives argue that it is the judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, and not scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Solicitor General of Obama's administration when the initial objections to the law were raised at the court of first instance.
His critics have pressed for Kagan recused himself from the case, saying it was too invested in the defense of the law, to be impartial.
Kagan has not given any indication that it would.
Boeing has a record of $18 billion in commercial aircraft
The Emirates airline control 50 Boeing 777, bi-couloirs passenger aircraft, with an option to buy 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing dreamliners to Oman air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary in a company receives an order looking 50 of its products.
In contrast, it is a case where the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and that 50 had achieved the record sum of $18 billion.
Equally incredible is that Boeing received this order: the Middle East, growing a gold mine of future orders for aircraft.
In a forecast issued Monday, the Chicago company believes that airlines in the Middle East will need over the next 20 years of 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion.
Over the weekend, Boeing was informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft control of its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
It is the Emirates airline based in Dubai who spent this gargantuan control.
Boeing has announced at the Berlin Air Show in Dubai from 2011 that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total amount of the order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said Monday that the Oman air company has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed dreamliners, a model which boasts significant fuel savings and amenities for the passengers.
The amount of those six aircraft s "is more than a billion dollars.
"Clearly, this is very positive for Boeing," said Neal dihora, Morningstar analyst.
"These customers in particular have great value."
In the Middle East, the oil producing countries have much more of their airlines.
They not only have the means to pay for the planes, but a rise in fuel prices, usually detrimental for the airlines because it represents their costs the most - would not be so damaging, because the country needs money with the oil price increase.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft when the price of oil rises, reported dihora.
"They have a built-in risk coverage," he said.
The control of Emirates strengthen Boeing's dominance in the market for wide-body aircraft and help to curb the attempt to curtail the competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after the announcement of Airbus to postpone the beginning of a larger version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300er.
Airbus postpone its beginnings to enhance the growth continued at the request of its customers to increase its carrying capacity and its autonomy.
The actions of the Boeing Company have risen by 1.5 per cent to reach the $67,94.
The Mexican President's sister clearly beaten in elections the message
Luisa Maria Calderon said that drug traffickers had helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the gubernatorial race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its attempt to enter the Governor's message during violent elections, and said Monday that drug traffickers have promoted one of his opponents.
The early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of Governor of the State of the West.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for the message but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon on radio in an interview on Monday, after the elections.
"They have threatened our candidates, electoral officials... they took the box, have set up roadblocks... and had forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI has ruled Mexico for 70 years until losing the Presidency in 2000.
But it holds his return, and a victory in the message is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo does seems to be demarcated dearth of Calderon, who was leading in opinion polls before the election day.
Calderon, candidate of the Conservative Party of National Action Party, or Pan, has refused to recognize Vallejo as winner.
Silvano aureoles, candidate of the leftist party of the democratic revolution, or PRD, which hold the office of Governor, came third, a painful defeat before the presidential elections of 2012 for this left divided and unfortunate.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the State capital, has denied any connection with drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
The message has long been dominated by drug gangs specializing in the trafficking of marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the home State of President Calderon, and he chose the message to launch a military offensive against the traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a NAP Mayor was assassinated as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have surrendered to the campaign by fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the message being in, a victory would help the party in its tracks.
The rights that are expected to represent the PRI in the race for President, Enrique Pena Nieto, praised Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
The ADB urged Asia to help the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called upon India and help China to prepare for the euro zone to emerge from the crisis of the sovereign debt to avoid a long-term decline that inhibit the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat NAG, the Director General of the ADB headquarters in Manila, said that the two economic powers to the fastest growing regions of the world should "do everything in their power" to expedite the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
It has discouraged the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) to look at the difficulties of Europe a "indifferent eye" and noted that Asian financial support with the leaders and resources of the Europe would help to avoid a collapse in the long term to the global.
"We are all in this crisis."
"So anyone can help overcome the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected until" at some point, but it is not immune to '.
"so if China and India can help, that there is nothing to prevent the."
In recent months, the euro zone has been seriously weakened by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of borrowing Italian is dangerously soared, and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The flourishing of sovereign debt crisis in Europe has been splashing the fear that the global economy is not in recession, and the appeal of the leading emerging economies to come together to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. NAG a présagé Asian order that the IMF aid, but he has also said that such bilateral assistance - as U.S. financial rescue fund buying bonds, the European financial stability - offered more negotiating power with Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro zone as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a depletion of the inflow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro zone remains unstable and troubled," he said.
"We have enormous challenges ahead, and we should maintain a high level of growth."
"This is not a choice, it is a must, because as trouverions-nous work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the wealthy Europeans as they confront their own substantial economic challenges.
Ashutosh varshney, Professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to accept aid to Europe with 1.2 billion people, including at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"one day, they discover that the Greeks retire at age 50 and they go on holiday in the sun, and it will be difficult to swallow," he said.
Lee Howell, the President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why the reservations of India should be used to keep many Greek officials well-paid jobs in poorly managed to generate losses, as in the railway sector.
Mr. NAG said that the euro could provoke "a significant impact" throughout Asia.
The ADB estimates of economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia in 2011 and 2012 are now "risks of loss" because of the threat Union.
He noted that the emerging markets vulnerable needed to develop "contingency plans" to protect itself from an economic downturn and massive capital flight.
The Pentagon's stern warnings about potential cuts of the defence
The Defense Secretary, Leon Panetta, has increased the pressure on the Congress Monday, warning that the impending automatic cuts would undermine national security that triggered a chain reaction of financial corridors of the Pentagon to the battlefields of Afghanistan through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon digests already $450 billion in reductions over the next decade, but fear now that an additional $600 or more cuts have to be imminent if the Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The effects of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, r-arizona, and Lindsey Graham, r-south Carolina.
He said that the Congress's failure to reach a budget agreement resulting in what is called the kidnapping, would 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"such a significant reduction, applied and indiscriminate, make the most of our vessels and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building, and severely affect other efforts to modernize," written Panetta to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us in a number of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction would be imposed if quickly, almost certainly we should send civilians on leave without pay" in order to achieve the goal.
"These changes ébranleraient the faith of those who support our military and endommageraient seriously our preparation."
The cuts would affect any combat troops, continued Panetta.
"Although funding in time of war of accounts of contingency operations abroad was not directly affected by the abduction, the war effort would be negatively affected by the severe disruption in the core," warned Panetta.
"The contractor personnel would be reduced, delays in the contracts and the supervision of contract that support the war."
"the personnel manager salaries would be reduced, resulting in delays of payments to suppliers of war, and the support is legal and political disruption."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"the result of a kidnapping on the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of us as the undisputed global head of military power."
"We are firmly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon at the publication of the letter to Panetta.
"This is not a result that we can live with, and that is certainly not what we should impose."
"The Kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen.
That the letter of Panetta and recent warnings of senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or appeal to exempt the Pentagon cutbacks, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent regarding possible cuts, even if he's in the top post of the Pentagon holding several years of expertise of the budget to Congress and the White House and knowing that he was confronted with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense has painted a bleak picture of what may happen - a military with a shell, but not the nucleus.
"It is a marine vessel without."
"This is a team without bullets."
"It is a fighter plane, without enough pilots trained."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs which do not have enough trained soldiers could do the Mission," said Panetta in his introductory remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a strength depressed, unprepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries."
"de facto," it is an aggression.
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta stated specifically how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and risk assumed unacceptable in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects might move on to sunset, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list included the fighter f35 joint strike, a new bomber planned ballistic missile submarine, the new generation of combat, the new ship coastline and the new field, to replace the Humvee vehicle of the army and navy.
Put an end to the development and testing of the f35 could generate cost savings of $80 billion over 10 years, but his supporters say that is a vital step to improving and for potential threats from China and other rivals.
How a lie
A look at the recent headlines indicates how the deception and lies are ubiquitous in daily life.
The Republican nominee for President Herman Cain is in the process of exchange of allegations of harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State officials have been accused of perjury for allegedly covered up reports that a retired football coach had sexually molested boys.
Last week the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by an open microphone saying President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie is destroyed careers and convulsé of countries.
The Member of Congress from New York and celebrity of the Internet Anthony Weiner, rose to a fool by issuing denials quickly contradicted with hard evidence.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign financing in the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of that has experienced history will never forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered by lying in its second term on ever more his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating on tests of the schools and universities are legion.
There have been cases where teachers have given the answers of tests for students in order to curry favor with on their performance evaluations.
The mentors who should teach the contrary to send messages that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception let us meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are lies.
Another study showed that foreigners are deceiving three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detection or monitor falsehoods is a core competency that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to get who said: "I have had," the detection of fraud is a serious arm of scientific knowledge based on data collected over the last six decades in prestigious universities who conducted a thorough search of such projects, including in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about the lies were démystifiés.
The Liars you look in their eyes.
They do bégayent, or are not always feeling.
Not to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect and difficult to detect.
A lie detector qualified can discover the truth by examining the structure of the Declaration, the facial micro-expressions, the training of the issue and the response time.
I spent several years studying scientific results in the large corps and always emerge from the knowledge on the deception, and it is clear that the detection of modern deception is a skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world, especially if your responsibilities include the hiring, interviews, negotiation or management.
The good liars are adept at both read the other, at home, in managing their own emotions and intuitively that detect how others perceive the.
We know from research that the extravertis lie more than the many cases inward looking and do, the men say more lies "focused on them," while the women say more of lies "centred on the other" - usually to protect one's feelings - for a married couple lying less often to their partners that unmarried people (but that the lies that they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a mécréant, the others will feel less guilty to lying.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, look at the normal condition of your subject.
This is called "Establishing the baseline data."
This helps to provide a benchmark for measuring further changes.
Look at the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You must know if someone rubs its normal feet constantly so as not to launch perfidious when you see wagging the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for the signs of conduct misleading statements and non-verbal.
Consider these indices such as red flags, not evidence of deception.
The misleading people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their history, they can target their feet toward the door, look to a door, significantly change of position or make a relief "post-interview exaggerated" - a sigh of relief, a change of position when all the difficult questions are.
Interrogators are often falsely that the interview was completed just for trying to start the reaction post-interview.
Also, heed the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson has gone through the past while claiming that his wife killed was alive, triggering a national search for the end.
The misleading people can also use language became: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat entirely a difficult issue.
The most frequent verbal indicators is subtle.
Someone can use much of "waffle" during its response to a difficult issue: "well... to tell the truth... if I remember property... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptive response rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize the deception is possible.
Those skills will improve the chances of anyone to avoid the victimization by Hustlers in their personal and professional lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be confused after the threat of delayed approval of U.S.
A few days after the administration of Obama had threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, causing anger among unions, while appeasing the environmentalists, the company seeking to build the pipeline said she is ready to redirect the draft to be put back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the pipeline planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of dunes of Nebraska, and was confident that the project will have to win his approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Capitol of Nebraska.
The Gazette of TransCanada, Alex pourbax, contends that the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval from a pipeline, but with a different route.
This followed the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a permit for the federal project until it received new studies of potential routes to avoid areas of dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water sources.
"This is a real way forward, 'says Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have postponed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although the officials deny the political involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a decision by the State Department, and expressed its support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day for the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
In this regard, he would cross six States.
He is loathed by environmentalists, but loved by the working groups, which have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are pushing a bill to force the removal of the sand Hills region and of the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study has found that the project would be only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry has said that the Ministry has ordered a separate inquiry in the Inspector General's review process, focused on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is whether a company that has been employed in the initial study was an inappropriate choice of its relationship to TransCanada.
Patti Labelle prosecuted for allegedly caused a young child to vomiting fear
A family of New York claims that the DIVA disco Patti Labelle launched in an outburst of violence in the lobby of their apartment building in Manhattan, terrified their daughter to the point where it has spewed of fear stream.
The tirade of the Singer "Lady marmalade" spooked the small Genevieve monk aged 18 months, to the extent that it has been "changes in personality, sleep disorder" and "the heightened fear of foreigners," said his family during the trial in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year while the stage technician Kevin monk, his wife of kindergarten teacher, roseanna, and Genevieve were preparing to travel with their families.
While Kevin monk would search the car, roseanna monk took to the lobby of their building on riverside Boulevard with their luggage, Genevieve in his arms.
Roseanna monk has stated that it had stopped near the door and had asked his daughter for a time.
"someone came behind me and said: 'Do you know what your daughter?" I said' yes' and I went to look for her, "she argues.
Labelle has angrily reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"she told me of a belligerent tone:" You should not let your daughter near the door, "said roseanna monk.
"I replied:" I am not interested in what you say or think ."
It has become enragée and began using profanity, the word 'and the word' strongly...
She had a bottle of water and began spraying me the water of the cylinder.
She said that at this point, Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to her: 'Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
Labelle was thrown on the mummy, which retained Genevieve in his arms, and had to be restrained by his entourage, which was caused to a waiting car, said roseanna monk.
The little girl was crying so much that she started to vomiting, apparently.
Later, the family sent a note of apology of Labelle, but there was no response.
The lawyer and representatives of Labelle did not return calls for comment.
The complaint seeks unspecified damages, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family planned to donate any money received in a cancer charity for children.
"The aim is to keep Patti Labelle responsible for his behavior," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying a child of 18 months."
Adversity climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario Lopez Valdez, to Sinaloa increased unemployment and the informality, foreign investment has dropped and the economy shrank
2011 is a year which will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, this is the first year of government of Mario Lopez Valdez, auto-appelé of change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity in the beginning of the year, the increase is not, on the other hand there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The temperatures of the February, apart from causing losses of trillion for the agricultural sector, have limited the ability of the State's economy for the growth, have caused a decline in the overall economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic 31,16 per cent decrease in agriculture, which has affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.

The economic slowdown has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography the state unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year with a rise accelerated, because during the January to March 55 thousand 053 sinaloens were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent from July to September and the average has continued to raise up to 6.19 percent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand sinaloens unemployed, an increase from the first half of 18,000 969 people.
Least of liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa multi-factor during the year is, according to the Economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Director of the Economic and Social Sciences Faculty of the UAs, rising unemployment can indirectly be explained in terms of activities conducted by the public policy.
"what we are seeing is an increase of unemployment is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity on the market due to the limitation of resources by the legislation passed in the Congress to combat the laundering of money, because the people who earn $of the illicit in a manner that is not easy work for the win, they invest them and use them in something," he says.
Migration detained
Lopez Cervantes said that the rise in unemployment is also due to demographic factors.
"The number of people leaving the State to go to work abroad, the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because come in they have already struggling to find work, they remain here and ask for sources of work, which means that the unemployment increase," a déclaré-t-il.
Lack of serious
The analysis of the market working sinaloen is compounded by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that prevails among the working conditions, according the INEGI, occupied the 60,38 per cent of the population in this State is working without pay as worker in any social insurance agency.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for gap for the State are low wages, the entity has the lowest wages of the country, according to data from the National Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of workers sinaloens was, until September, five thousand pesos 352, far below the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI

In turn, the secretariat of the Government's economic development for the State records a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, mainly recorded by the tertiary sector companies.
The debt
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the State Government has requested in July to Congress public approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipes, with the goal of reviving the economy, congressional approval of the State has been to 2,600 trillion pesos and until November they did not observe any benefit from the debt in any sector of the economy of the State.

Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of the processing industry, said that in 2011 there has not been a harmonization of the wishes of the different sectors, take the Government to the State.
"the return of the economy of Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, working hard to recover lost ground this year, in 2012 we must double our efforts, it took align the efforts of everyone, especially the already synchronized to the new government team, hope that next year will be much better, 'he says.
Slow economic

"The economic bottom fluxe is produced in several events, among which the frosts, one of the main effects has been slow an economy that is fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that leads to a level acceptable E flows in the trial, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we ignore much below the expectations that we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation

"In general terms, we have observed that the work has been done, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefined the role and the Economic Department of the State, because it is important that we detonates the full potential of human and material resources of Sinaloa," he says.
Much to
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision of the future that harnesses the best efforts of the Government.

He noted that the current administration has made advances in the way of management of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked so hard and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he says.

The Court "validates the cut-off analogue" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analog signales by the digital exchange is a more important that the world has suffered the past years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the nation (approved) dismissed the constitutional controversy that the Senat and the Chamber of Deputies have lodged against the presidential decree that advance the so-called "analog" cut-off of 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes necessary to invalidate the have not been met.
A minority of four ministers, take the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, found that the President Felipe Calderon has not exceeded his authority when he issued the decree outlining the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital TV land.
With this result, the controversial constitutional promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionalité decree, and this continues to be in force.
The award, drafted by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, suggested the statement of the Decree as non-constitutionnel, due to the fact that the regulation on radio and television is an award given by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (COFETEL), contrary to the principles of subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the draft voted only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Sanchez, Luna and Cordero even.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversy to contest the decree and assuming the complaints, the Minister Sanchez Cordero has suspended the implementation of the decree and activities planned for the digital transition.
The plenary meeting of the Ministers also decided to dismiss the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the draft before the Minister Sanchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Government cannot structure under a general standards of the measures to ensure that the Government is preparing itself.
"I do not believe that if it did it would undermine the autonomy of the regulatory body," and said that the public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Government, which has constitutional mandate to the leadership of the State.
The substitution of signales from audio digital signales is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered the past years and it resulted in a better use of the radio spectrum signal quality, better and more channels.
Postponing the change, a soutenu-t-il, would postpone the profits of the form which digitised involves a decision of public interest which is not just a technical problem, "because it also includes the economic, social, political and national security."
These issues, a souligné-t-il, "require the operation of an entire system makes, in accordance with the principle of the Economic Department of the State, comprises a group of functions that the Constitution gives the powers of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries throughout the world have already finished the transition of digital technology and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they had the very specialized technical bodies.
We cannot conclude that the Executive, by issuing the decree dispute, had invaded a form the sphere of competence of the Congress, as it provides in the administrative level compliance with laws issued by the legislative, assura-t-il.
The analysis of the possibility of a breakdown "vote by vote" in message
According to the evidence cited by prep, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes for 879 of 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality in the trial this year to electoral message, where according to the evidence cited by the programme of preliminary election results (prep) the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes for 879 of 6 thousand 74 minutes total.
Thus, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of facilities, Maria de los Angeles llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body has approved a set of guidelines to harmonize local standards for federal electoral reform.
It is recalled that message has not registered or its Constitution or its state electoral code or its electoral justice law, at the same time that the Congress has approved the reforms shortly before that eventually the legal limit for the entry into force of the electoral process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel has failed its publication within the framework of the law, the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that he had some of the objections.
The same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the nation (approved) has resolved the controversial constitutional promoted by the local legislative power and branded as "illegal and invalid" the vote of the agent of the State to the constitutional reforms, because it has no right to "punish them or challenge."
Interviewed on the possibility of "vote by vote," Maria de los Angeles llanderal said that with the adoption of guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make the count was biased and voting totals by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial count of electoral votes, one or several packages, it may be that: the results of minutes odds; there is no record of voting and counting with the ballot box is not the President's residence; or there are obvious errors or deterioration of minutes.
In addition, the total number of votes received in all polls of the election can be achieved when there is an indication of the fact that the difference between the candidate presumed winner of the election and took second place in the poll is equal to or by less than a percentage point; as long as that at the beginning of the session is a petition by the representative of the party and / or coalition who introduced the second of candidates reported.
The total number of ballot can also be achieved if common at the end of the counting, it means that the difference between the candidate supposed winner and second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that the petition by the representative of the Party whose candidate came second, in which case we will exclude the electoral packages that have been subject of a partial tally.
It should be noted that this is the election of Morelia, which according to the prep, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of 923 minutes total.

The new Government will be formed Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new Government, which will deal with a crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new Government, which will deal with a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic ruin and has endangered the whole euro zone.
A statement issued by the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he is capable of forming the Government.
The expected to present a Cabinet in its majorities by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new Executive will assume his post.
Monti has said that he would announce the result of his conversations with the President's political parties in his essay to form a Government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner for journalists.
Monti has not said explicitly that it could form a Government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
"The framework is now well established," ajouta-t-il.
Monti has completed the process to form a Government in less than three days, in a shorter time than normally, while Italy fight a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to levels of impossible to sustain.
The new administration headed by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to recover confidence in Italy who had been assigned.
In emphasizing the pressure on Monti to dispatch, the volatility of markets to placed the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds construction above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have duu saved.
Emma marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers' association Confindustria, told the media after his meeting with Monti: "We have said that we would support the Government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to sort of this emergency.
The potential success of Monti has been considerably boosted by the support of the FDP Party of Silvio Berlusconi, was forced to resign on last Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that the professor's efforts will have a good result," said to the press Angelino, editors Alfano, centre-right party secretary.
The support of FDP, the Italian party the largest, is significant because until now many of its members were opposed to the Government of majority technocrat that Monti form.
Support parliamentary
The new Government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be unpopular austerity reforms.
Every block or delay in his efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack by financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks has added to the pressure by noting that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti has begun Monday his consultations with political parties, unions and business organizations and youth groups and women.
He will end his tour of meetings Tuesday at the night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty on the success of the new Prime Minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 trillion, that would be too much for current financial defenses of eurozone.
Monti has said that his Government would persist until the future elections, scheduled in 2013, despite the widespread predictions on the fact that the politicians give it only time to implement the reforms before making the elections.
Monti has said that he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it must be formed only by specialists, an index of their objections before a process required by the financial pressure.
The political sources have reported that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the test to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is superior to that of Costa Ricans
Of the 22 called footballers from Spain, 10 participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 games.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, comparing the 22 summoned by the two countries for the friendly today, at 3: 05 p.m., at the national stadium in San Jose.
While the national champions of Europe, and the number one in the rankings of the monthly FIFA, HI ample inter-sélectionnes games for Class A Registry, the tricolour only has a defender Michael Umana as the only one to have 50 international matches.
This figure was reached the last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernandez.
The Spanish footballers playing in the League and in England's powerful clubs in the Premier League, keep the year a intense activities in the National League and Cup championships and contention in European cup as the Champions League.
To this he must add experience with furia Espanola during the complicated rounds of the European Cup and the world of football.
By contrast, the Costa Rican footballers have international experience limited to an area, as the concacaf, which is seen in a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the highest peak of the Spanish selection is the goalkeeper íker Casillas, who earlier on Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London has equalled the record for the former goalkeeper Andoni zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the tricolour and they will impose a new record for Spain, 120 international games.

It is followed by xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andres iniesta, with 62; CESC fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the part of Costa Rica, and close to Michael Umana are the Left Lateral junior Diaz, with 48 attendance and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five have exceeded 30 matches: keilor Navas with 31, Randall azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35.
The least.
Those who have less with more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Pique (37), Sergio busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro arbeloa (31) and Raul albiol (31).
The national side, with fewer than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy myrie with 23.
The rest do not even at 20.
While Nacho moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, to Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only a and ólman Vargas and edder Nelson must begin again.
The history of Spain is striker David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
In Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has the highest, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy myrie and parks.
Quinteto has included the country in his tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"" go to Costa Rica is a dream come true, "which
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the bassiste Jeff ament of Pearl jam, said that the Group is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday on the national stage.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the Group provides that for them it will be a dream come true to occur in this country.
Is that the bassiste and founding member Jeff ament, assured by speaking exclusively with Viva, of Brazil, last week.
The Group is in the American wing of his tour of celebration of two decades of work and Sunday 20 single makes his stopover in Central America.
That day will arise on the national stage, from 7: 30 a.m., next to the group of Los Angeles the x and the National de las robertas.
This is an excerpt of the conversation, the full transcript of which are in the nation on Internet.
Its proponents Costa Ricans, the fact that Pearl jam will come to Costa Rica is a dream come true, do you realize that your fans live?
Moving to Costa Rica is a dream that came true for us.
It is the second time in the South and Central America and so far this has been stellar.
I was in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is a beautiful country, and I think we can spend a few days.
This émotionne us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the group, the fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most ardent followers?
Thank you to stay around us for all these years.
There have been 21 years before we arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for having waited so long and we are sorry that so many time had to spend up to this concert.
Some people are already saying that the concert is the biggest show of the year.
What this adds a bit of pressure in your visit.
Some of the shows more we have offered during the last 21 years have occurred within the last two weeks.
We offered a huge two shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has been edited for the concert to Costa Rica.
We are very keen to occur.
We love this country, we like to make the SURF and the jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How have you discovered Costa Rica and its waves to make the SURF?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a good friend who lives in tamarindo, and the waves are incredible there.
My friends still to make the SURF in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in addition to Mexico, are great places to make the SURF; that is what we have learned, through the gents who love the SURF.
When the tour, you AVEs offered enormous shows, with many songs.
What do you have planned for your presentation to Costa Rica?
As we have never products there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we try to interpret songs of each album and give our fans a good and various directory.
You never tell the Repertory.
What is this?
I think this is partly because we have nine discs and we can interpret more than 120 songs and everyone likes of different songs, that is why it is very difficult to choose what songs interpret each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the Repertory that we no longer have interpreted for very long, it helps us to stay focused and surprising because we recall the reasons why we love these songs and that we can have forgotten.
As a result, the show is more interesting for us, and therefore I think it also becomes more attractive to people.
With this trip, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
In retrospect, it is difficult to believe everything that you have?
Yes, absolutely.
In the first place, I do not believe that any of us have ever imagined that we would form a large rock group, and the fact that we have done for more than 20 years is that it looks like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the ability to continue to make music together we émotionne much.
We love and we love create music.
We are fortunate to go to parts of the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things could only get better for us.
That meant for you to have been a key factor in the creation of the grunge?
It was always an honour for us to form part of the group of major groups.
We are very friendly with the people of soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising when a movement arose from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group arises from the city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to form part of the Group in Seattle.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we had a festival with Alice in chains and we have been in Canada with mudhoney, we saw at soundgarden in their tour, therefore we are lucky to be still friends with all of them and it is an honour for us to form part of the sound of Seattle, which has arise.
It is very strange that a group like the your remains united and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and MATT (Cameron) here 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally lasts.
In the first place, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we all care for others.
We are all intimate friends and with that of musical boulevards that give freedom to experiment.
We have to trust each other with the music of everyone and it can only get better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, with your success, you could do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we do not take too much time on tour because it is easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and loving people of your music.
If we do not forget that people are out there for the music, it helped us not to forget that we must respect the music has and made, without falling into the head is famous and a rock star, which is not really to any of us.
How you remember your project, Mother Love bone?
I believe we have written a good songs and at the beginning it was magnificent.
We have been a group for nearly three years and we have not published a disc before the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it took so little, and the most important is that we are still very friendly with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) which began in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo of the incredible person that Andy has been and how it made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laughing, talking about the music, the football and many other things with him.
It is a surprising and we lack.
The national group las robertas will open the show to Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie vedder and for this you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals and this was the group that we liked him more, therefore we are eager to see what las robertas can offer online and it must be very fun.
Why change you always yello Ledbetter's words in direct?
It is a matter for ed (Eddie vedder), so I do not know.
It is the singing and I believe that it did with the first words that he imagines.
As bassiste, what are its influences?
There's so much...
Among the first which I remember there are geezer Butler, John entwistle, C.J. ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, chuck dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk about the entire afternoon on the bassistes that I love.
How has succeeded Pearl jam has maintained under the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, this reminds me of the groups that I mentioned, as mudhoney, soundgarden, nirvana and all those who have surfaced at the same time and, if this is now under, I think this is wonderful, because it is a worthy music listening and the groups as mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At the beginning, the music had a more obscure and now it has become more positive.
What is this change?
It is interesting, because I think there has been some songs on the new album, which seem more light, but there were also songs, such as the end or just breathe qualified as songs very obscure, even if they may sound a little positive.
With the two, when ed has played for me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply obscure songs.
I think that if you empowered and there is a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things begin to influence your art and your music and songs, no doubt, is that for me.
I also think that it can also be pleased and even as it can be made of the obscure music.
Peru:
Fujimori again hospitalized for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength in the pies, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72, who has been serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his Government (1990-2000) suffers from a variety of ailments, take a cancer of language for which he underwent surgery four times and under control.
The congressiste Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal physician, said in television Canal N that Fujimori will be evaluated during three days in the National Institute of malignant diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his legs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the surrender of the punishment for humanitarian reasons, without doubt, he said that his or her wishes because he is innocent.
He underwent surgery four times of cancer of language, and a weight loss of weight of 18 kilos, and other diseases, such as severe stomach inflammation affected, a kyste of pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and traffic problems in the feet, outlined the doctor.
Fujimori serving life imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Police special operations.
In April it was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people because of a squadron of annihilation of the army, which has operated clandestinely in the early years of his Government.
Mujica trip to Mexico to strengthen political ties
A formal procession, led by the Uruguayan President, Jose Mujica, and composed of various ministers and bosses, train this Tuesday a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderon, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, business leaders and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans residents in Mexico, according to the agenda issued by the Presidency.
The meeting between the two Presidents in the city of Guadalajara, will be "conducive to the exchange of information in the Political Affairs between the two nations," according to the information released by the South American country's presidency on its web site.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to persuade the Governor to support Uruguay in the incident with France, which took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, has included the South American countries on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy has threatened to exclude from the international community countries continue to be havens, a statement that has resulted in the dismissal of Uruguay and appeal to its Ambassador for consultations this European country.
Mexico President since November of the G20, a grouping of emerging and developed the highest in the world, and has in effect with the Latin American country, since January this year, an agreement for the exchange of tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government has tried in recent years to send the implementation of existing agreements to exchange tax for ending the "GRI list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implémentent all standards of international cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have in effect since 2004 a free trade agreement (TLC) increased exchange of goods between the two nations.
The plumber moustachu gets into three dimensions with "super Mario 3D land"
Super Mario has fought, indefatigable, for 25 years to save at the Princess peach from the clutches of villain bowser, but it had never been done in three dimensions: in "super Mario 3D land" he will fight for the sake of the young technology stéréoscopique.
The title, which expires this month to stores around the world, was designed from the beginning to harness the characteristics of the Nintendo console mobile 3Ds, which allows the use of play in three dimensions without glasses.
"Mario is the man who must say it must operate the stéréoscopie without glasses," said the Head of Press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "super Mario 3D land" is "the first video game for Nintendo originally designed for this support," because of the success so far as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: ocarine of time 3D" was the adaptation of existing securities.
The spokesman for Nintendo has argued that, in spite of being in 3D, "super Mario 3D land" is a video game "accessible" that allows a Party quickly and smoothly.
Alvarez said that "super Mario 3D land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the users less astute.
Once overcome, most experts may make a "second round" levels of play, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users can choose to real time between an aggressive "d" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but that would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
The incursion of super Mario in the three-dimensional also requires the return of the personality of a console mobile, a fact that was happening in 2005.
In these Nintendo video games is a nod to the followers of saga and repeat the formula for success of previous games, which lies in the fact that the plumber moustachu must travel affected platforms of peril for release to the Princess peach.
Even if I find new player in the movement, the environments, costumes and enemies and also in the case of Luigi "feasible."
Colom agrees with the extradition of Portillo to United States
The President Alvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given the order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to meet the United States for conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This ends the trial for Guatemala to heed the call of the countries of the North, which called for Portillo's try.
In a press conference, Colom said that its decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive by taking into account the fact that a trial court had already ordered his extradition.
He said that during his tenure he had not helped "in any judicial resolution and gave way to all extraditions that he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales, Victor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
Colom has done this requires an Executive approach after exhausting all constitutional and judicial bodies to try the former agent of the interval 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after resolving its legal position in Guatemala and after guaranteeing its human rights.
Portillo was unqualified for misappropriation of q120 million at the Defence Ministry, where he was President, who was the trial which preceded the extradition, but the prosecution has appealed and revived the case.
Trinijove helped to 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of youth without training
The first 25 years of the life of the entity of social support trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation over a quarter of a century.
Add to that the long centenary of jobs being achieved by the elderly.
The anniversary was yesterday to take stock in an act performed in an old industrial complex Fabra I coats in which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighbourhood of trinitat Vella in 1986 with the goal of helping people poorly trained, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
The celebration of yesterday at Sant Andreu focused a large number of bodies and institutions that in the past 25 years have collaborated with the Association.
The varied political representation in full electoral season, highlighted the unitary character of trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Catalan regional government (Government), Artur MAS and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the note the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor in the current mayor and municipal councillor éco-socialiste Ricard Goma.
Have also assisted in the Great Hall of Fabra I coats the current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís cleries and the Director-General of the Caixa, Jaume lanaspa.
MAS said that trinijove was born in a very difficult period and that the present is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The President has given trinijove as example as to combat bad circumstances and to give hope to the people in difficulty.
"the crisis is not something new for the Organization and for the work she is doing," he said.
Property occupied by squatters for micro-fêtes, evacuated
The invaders were appropriate for 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, at balmes, 51
The 12 occupants have abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that residents of the street number 51 balmes lived has ended.
Twelve people have voluntarily left at noon yesterday illegally occupied the building and organizing micro-fêtes that despairing Westerners neighbors, unexpected by judicial order and without need of a police raid.
At the end of the operation has been changed the lock on the door so that the situation persists.
"As of today there will be a" access control, affirmât the Administrator.
The squatters, who invaded 11 of 13 apartments in the building, the rest were habités-, have won the electrical system and some of the water, in part to paint the walls and allow the residue of all kinds, especially kits of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the festive scene of masses, which lasted until two days and despairing Westerners the unexpected tenants.
Alongside the building there is a discotheque balmes, 51, who was also affected.
Its owner, Maria pantinat explained to Europa Press that as soon as the occupation of the building its case dropped an 80 per cent.
The owner of the Club said that the invaders of the property being unfair to the jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses to three euros, while in the club they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the local recreation was responding to complaints from neighbors to noise, while, according to it, the trouble were not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied homes and especially the celebrations there, which were more frequent and intense over the past few weeks, depending on the angry neighbors in the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the problems were so big that it has even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and it was nine months that it "forgive" the rent.
La Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The President of the Group of municipal town pp, Alberto Fernandez, had sought the past week "the immediate evacuation of the building for dealing with the challenges of life and citizenship as he engineered to residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but last month the squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must deal with impunity and be relentless against the anti-social behavior generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan) police evacuated a building in NOU Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. police has moved to the street number 35 mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who noted that four people gained access to the building.
The four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the appropriateness of the convening beyond the controversy over the fees
The municipal assistance for the 16 doors again opened the debate on the role of collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, in the culmination of the déjà-éteinte Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration has printed posters of promotion of collserola.
The brochure defines the mountain as the great metropolitan park in the Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park has become again, in many people's imagination, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital is the only one that focuses not on the North-South axis, otherwise high (mountain) - low (Sea).
The qualification of collserola as Park is for the benefit of this idea.
The reference was more Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boar in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the mayor called a méga-compétition composed by 16 competition for all access doors to collserola.
A door leading to the idea of Park, no doubt.
That is, or someone wants to stem the tide.
The issue appears alone: collserola: Park or mountain?
The assistance, both for his organization as regarding the reflection on the city is a topic of conversation of all architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of the ancient caste of elected speak when they identify themselves in an elevator.
And this is one of the few opinions on which coincide three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who are presented.
Miguel any, Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: the examination is appropriate.
For any, after addressing the littoral front "it is necessary to" discuss "the mountain front" because the speech of ildefons Cerda, blocks Green has not been brought to an end.
"We have to start from the premise that the largest fleet of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its availability.
Collserola is more complex ," gave the verdict the architect for the title of" collserola "contains a" Trap doors "lexicon: No need to consider them" such as access to a park, but the delimitation of some areas in which we must act ."
Modol, as any and Bayona with experience in the urban world, described the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils."
The perils that is caused by "the uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after his experience in the 1980s and who was in the area of the Forum "his" swan song.
The first fear is the demarcation of borders on which we can build.
"limit something already means making the next step," i.e., crossing it.
"We have to think of new instruments urban-planning, planning, because current [in reference to outline metropolitan (PGM) ] can cause of authentic disasters."
By keeping more to the issue, modol binary form that, briefly, the slope of the region El valleys of collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not."
Modol said that there was already a work by the sponsorship of collserola which "should not be lost," in appreciation for the opportunity that the mayor gave his corporation to be involved in this project, "from the first moment."
In addition, it means that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this profile technical must lead the multidisciplinary teams ("a success," he says) which is a creation of: "We, the architects, should be only an instrument."
Bayona insinuated that the answer to the question that provides the title of the piece is complex, with bases of support it lacks a comprehensive vision of collserola: 'they called 16 competitive business, he says, to bring montagne-mer, but there was not a longitudinal reading that way and understands the entire area ."
This is, at least in this case, that he has chosen to take part in the 16 contests.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the programme and with that definition of the architect of the door nearby.
In his opinion, yes, the mayor should ensure that the Gaza immediately from ronda of dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the City and the Green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and will released
After 72 days of detention, the delegate's legal casino Red granted pardon to the brother of Monterrey's mayor for the proceedings initiated against him for alleged extortion
After 72 years arrested, manual Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the merits of the legal authority of the casino Red grant forgiveness in the second District Criminal Court, following a trial for blackmail against the mayor's brother of Monterrey.
After the attack the casino Royale, the owner of the casino red, Sergio Gil Garcia, has published a series of photos and videos in which allegedly manual Jonás him would a quotte economic for the Mayor of Monterrey allows the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, prosecutors opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother paniste and 2 September he had been arrested and held in custody for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Prosecutor of 3 of property crimes, he was transferred to the detention centre 1, located in the old district of the capital of the State.
He stayed there for 49 days when it was granted a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor has dismissed the crimes of corruption and organized crime.
The October 19 he was transferred to the prison in cadereyta, allegedly for doing singing with one and a half million pesos the casino owners red; but he spent only a few hours at the medium-security detention centre since there were death threats against him.
The authorities have allowed him to continue the trial reflected in the municipal cells of San Nicolas de los Garza.
The 25 October capture an order has been issued by the Registrar of the second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient evidence confirmed to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gambling house in exchange for its operation.
On Monday, the merits of the legal authority of the casino red, Victor Aldo Garcia Gomez, appeared before Judge Jose Luis pecina to seek forgiveness for the mayor of the region's brother; therefore it could recover their freedom in the hours that followed.
During the legal formalities, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, interviewed Garcia Gomez if the injury had been recovered and that associates of the gambling house had been that had granted the pardon, but the lawyer has tried not to disclose the name.
Under the record 197 / 2011 give forgiveness for Jonás Larrazábal and later may not be any claim to the proceedings against him; it will require no compensation for damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of the merits of the legal authority of the gambling house, at 3: 50 p.m. there has ordered the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yanez, was moved to the prison's municipe of San Nicolas de los Garza to furnish Jonás he was forgiven lawfully and his case would be dismissed.
It will also provide the free immediately that the court order was issued.
The Dionisio Perez Jácome gives the details of the plane crash in which has lost his life the Chief Secretary, Francisco Blake and other seven persons
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) had informed him that the results highlighted on the accident in which had lost his life on Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, pointing out that the helicopter had shocked directly on the ground in comprehensive structural integrity, without the pilot could try a landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jácome, Secretary of communications and transport, said that before the take-off of the airplane, the pilot noticed that the climate conditions are adequate to steal.
"The elements seem to indicate that the Unit has had a number of contacts with the soil, the blades had contact with trees to 25 metres when unity has lost the fuselage.
It also informed that the Unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it fulfilled the requirements necessary to transport personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations conducted in the impact zone does not apply the emergence of parts to the ground.
"in a research there reported that there is a lack of parts and components of the aircraft in another location, the impact has been presented in a structural.
"the helicopter had been designed for 19 passengers and meet the requirements for the transport.
The ground was a Pante of seven to 30 degrees of willingness.
For the moment, the Secretary said that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible, but the investigation could last a few months, it may even take a year.
In turn, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Managing Director of airports and auxiliary services has assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the major State presidential functioned in speed of cruisers and this happened on a soft soil ascendant.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a cruiser operating at the time of the impact," he says.
During the press conference, the holder of the SCT, Perez Jácome, outlined six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight.
According to the regulations, the flight was conducted under the visual flight rules, which means that the crew should have the visibility during the flight and ground.
Weather:
The reports in IMMA gave adequate conditions during takeoff, and, as a measure that the aircraft was moving towards the border zone between DF and the State of Mexico had layers of clouds to low height.
Selected roads.
It is likely that "because of the conditions of cloudiness crew had sought an area of height weaker and more visible to the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there has been no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in one small area.
The information available so far suggests that the impact was held on a straight path and lateral.
The model of dispersion of remnants of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter had struck against the concrete floor in terms of structural integrity.
It was not detected traces of fire or explosion.
In the area there was still no sign in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The final results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had wide contacts with the ground.
During the ground work the pieces of the aircraft were found at a height of 9000 200 feet above mean sea level, the ground was a slope which ranges from seven dégrées to 30 degrees of willingness.
The photographs show the sequence in which he was possibly désarticulé during his trip.
The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impactes with the ground.
After careful research in an area further that place surrounded, around the accident, it has not found of disperses parts of the aircraft, which bears the presumption of that impact has taken place in conditions of structural integrity.
SSM announcement Protocol to find the obesity gene
Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people; this is borne by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it conducts an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, as Protocol 'genetic of obesity in children and adolescents' which would provide the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the investigative unit in biochemistry from hospital medical specialities of National Medical Centre of the 20th century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that it had formed a team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and attend social.
This team is supported by scientists and graduate students at the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Center for investigation and of excellence (cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute.
In the investigation who are invited to participate the population with or without law, to stand for participating sports units of the IMSS Valle de Mexico, where the evidence to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 p.m.
He stressed that the Protocol has begun in the sports unit Cuauhtémoc (Estado de Mexico poniente) and that from October 8, the activity is taking place in the sports unit of nezahualcóyolt (Estado de Mexico City Guides).
After reaching the goal of raising 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the sports unit Independencia (south of Federal District) and eventually in the sports unit Morelos (north of Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and the E indicate the components and the importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors among children and young Mexicans to prevent the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the on 14 November's World Diabetes Day, he mentioned that the objective is to reach 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14 years, supervised and with the consent of their parents, for the implementation of specific questionnaires on food.
They will also be sought on their physical activity and their history of heredity family of diseases, to avoid the risk factors that trigger diseases like diabetes or kidney failure.
He elaborated that the Saturday will apply to all participants of the endurance anthropometric (weight, size, height) circumference, blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycérides, cholesterol and insulin and (the genetic seeking the people associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez noted that the investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals to the alarming increase in body weight in the minors.
'health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years, there has been an increase in the case of boys, from 77 percent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 percent; for the overweight there was also a dramatic rise, "stressed the IMSS specialist.
He noted that the justification for the research of markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is unlike any other in its genetic history.
He said that on average, the Mexicans have a 65 per cent of heredity Indian-American, a 30 per cent African Union and a five percent and this is reflected in the people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity is reflected in the inability of burning the excesses of energy that it consumes (calories), which falls in the form of fat.
The researcher said that the direct benefit to the participants is a comprehensive assessment of children, which can detect if they are overweight or obese.
Ali also said that the presence of dark blue envelopes (acanthosis) on the neck and forearms indicate the likelihood of suffering of metabolic and even pré-diabètes.
The information is run in a confidential, the doctors the call by writing to the parents, which is each of the measures and changes in lifestyle that they must take to prevent the disease.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components which cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: unhealthy eating habits the sedentary lifestyles, which is the lack of daily physical activity, spend most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use of means of transport instead to walk over short distances.
Another reason is the high calorie intake, i.e. the increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, lark of corn flour meat wrapped in sheets of maize, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic analysis in this Protocol.
The asphalt of the UNAM would avoid the Cassis
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty of the UNAM, develop asphalt modified with polymer to produce a mixture with a better return, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signales that the streets were solved, there would be no need to repair some 200 thousand Cassis each rainy season in the metropolitan area of Valle de Mexico, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Chemistry Faculty (FQ) of the UNAM, which ensured that if the process of construction and maintenance of asphalt pavement is adequate, the Cassis could be reduced or even eliminated altogether.
During its Conference a technological opinion on the Cassis, organized as part of the International Year of the chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of the asphalt, but with greater strength, both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera argued that such asphalt modified organisms could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the efficiency, and therefore, the training of Cassis.
He explained that the asphalt, the greatest share of oil, is a set of molecules of oil, with a heavier molecular weight molecules, called asphaltènes, and of molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthènes, which together provide the paved its characteristic viscoélastique behaviour.
The viscoélastique behaviour of the Asphalt is the fact that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C viscosity is very great and 50 degrees C he introduced a State almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt is slashing, ajouta-t-il.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental conditions and temperature, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Ciudad de Mexico in their majority were covered by a stone flexible, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve the asphalt.
Among the more superficial is the layer of asphalt, trained by small stones drenched in asphalt and compactées later.
Each of the small stones which form the layer, signalât-il, is bathed year asphalt.
When vehicles are generating efforts, it provides that forces spread very well in the sack.
If negotiations had been changed to the asphalt, spread quickly better, opinât the chemical playing.
On the layer of asphalt, he says, there is a final layer called the layer of Rolling Stone, made fine sand, which is also immersed in asphalt.
As it was in contact with the wheels of the car, it needs more mechanical force that the layer of asphalt and friction in the street.
As part of the stone to receive and distribute the efforts, the layer of rotation also demands that it has adequate thickness and the material that she is there must be treated.
The climate, particularly the humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor, especially water, he says, because they affect considerably the efficiency of the layer of asphalt.
When the ground is wet, Water spreads to the interior of the layer is difficult as it is, this soggy lump all the layers of stone and therefore cause of Cassis.
In the trial of formation of a Cassis, he says, the first to be striker is the film course and only later was assigned the layer of asphalt, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that must be treated to first signs with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the national system of researchers explained that the burden of vehicles is another important factor for the training of Cassis and therefore the thickness of each layer of stone must always be linked with the burden of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction, to prevent the formation of frequent Cassis.
Rafael Herrera has warned that it was still investigating and work on the asphalt, for example, the bituminous emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and help to repair the Cassis easily and without having to use the high temperatures.
That failed in Valle's candidate to be the new miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramirez Serna does not produce the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle receives its title number 14 of Princess.
Of new Valle del Cauca stayed with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle with the fact of being on the podium of winners, wear the crown of money and the Band that the honours as new Princess of Colombia.
With the result yesterday evening in Cartagena, where miss Atlantic is mounted with the Crown and the sceptre, the Department amount already 14 titles of Princess and Melina is one in a legion of women of Valle del Cauca, who found themselves near the Crown but have been proclaimed Princesses, between which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rosemary ALZATE (1983), Olga Maria arenas (1987), Leila blanque (1988), Monica EVERS (1989), Maria consuela pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle accused aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie accused aljure (2008).
Now the big question is where many people.
What's needed... because the result is the defeat of a favorite in each presentation has demonstrated that it was all for the new miss Colombia because it had not been elected in vain Queen of the police and best Jolie of vogue, documents obtained by the Queens taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key to the decision by the jury of her first Princess is the fact that she was not satisfied with his response to the question "What was the book that you a marked and why? posed by Martin Murillo Gomez, of the carreta Literaria leamos.
This is the candidate of Valle's response to this question:
"I read a lot, I think enough in the literature, I believe that it is a form of taking final culturaliser, I believe that the book that has marked my children is" the Little Prince ," a book that is quite deep.
Now I read "crime and punishment" is a book to read literature universal that we should all; and now I read the book of Irene nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "the love of the blood" ."
The response has not pleased first of all because of the term is culturaliser "and secondly to do not explain exactly how each book he had marked.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt relaxed and pleased with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for the world, please read a little, "the Little Prince" is a great book "
Between the assumptions launched that Valle was destroyed by cronyism.
A journalist from Bogota has hinted that being the preferred, the ovationnée and the candidate who received all preliminary price (challenge of gastronomy oster, the public vote for the best homemade costume, and Queen Mother), "It has roused the envy of other candidates, a stressed-out Queen and that is why it has not conspicuous on the scene."
And it was noted that in his first appearance in swimming trunks at the Hilton and its two marches of the eve of the coronation.
Even if the two parades had she appeared sure of itself, that it did not have the strength and the energy of representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist from the programme "como en Casa" (as in the House), Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was named Princess "confirmed that the candidate who gets the most prices during the competition does not receive the crown of Queen."
In addition, Valle has avoided the media at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another possibility is that Valle has failed to convince the jury on his interest in social initiatives, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.
That is why, two days before the election the legally binding international Lucy doughty said they sought a woman initiated in regard to the social needs of his country.
"only the beauty is not sufficient for a miss Colombia, we need to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the competition are already involved in the projects," expliqua-t-elle.
He also speculates that Valle has sinned by its defects in its back and fibrosis which is observed in his abdomen, but that is contradictory, precisely because the jury was elected as the candidate 'natural beauty' with the more healthy body, good food and physical work responsible.
The trainer of Queens Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best corps, that it is best, "but its fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in reality for me was not too well-known, he left points on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, the magazine cromos considers that the mistake of Valle's candidate was the surgery.
"The surgery are good, but Valle has failed them.
His body has never been his asset and it has lost because of this ."
For that price, that the national beauty contest starts for the first time, after the parade in swimming trunks had created a bitter prediction which was completed yesterday evening, it was said that this was a gift that Raymundo was to Melina for not giving him a taste of the Crown.
True or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of rule, not as sovereign, except as a Princess, a position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in international competitions by nomination of a national contest.
However, it will go down in history as one of the Queens that despite its dazzle crossing in Cartagena, failed to win the Crown.
So was the work of the Cali person who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali dactyloscopiste went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of 'Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officers is crucial.
The past 4 November a dactyloscopiste ITC of Cali has gone down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Leader of FARC: "Alfonso Cano," considering his fingerprints.
Of the seven dactyloscopistes who work in the local offices of the ITC, this week it was the turn of 'availability of Eliazar Gonzalez, a man of Puerto Tejada has worked for 21 years in the area of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez has worked in the municipes of Choco, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses that should be identified.
The year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and having read courses, it specializes in Fingerprint Offices, which is the study of the skin of friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
During the week of the Operation under the alias Alfonso Cano had been warned to Eliazar to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very large waiting there.
Friday, the night he went to Cauca in a helicopter of Palmira.
He knew that he had identified two corpses and that the suspected that one of them was the man who headed the guérrilla's earlier world, therefore he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo Leon Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigative team to the body, it has not recognized by his physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He did not have a beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area without glasses and much smaller.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a magnifying glass galtonienne, ink, a préleveur and a lamp, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the body with the card.
His eye had deceived him not: there were "Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the leader of the FARC.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopiste of Cali sijín the recognition that the President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar Gonzalez, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people to not know our work.
The fingerprint offices is an exact science, no margin for error, which could be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In part to identify the corpses, dactyloscopistes supports the investigations for the crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of people captured.
When caught, many offenders submit false identity cards or have no official.
We take their fingerprints and seek it in the database.
The researcher was Conte that cases of theft he had to remove part of the wall of a house, because in this place the thief had supported his hand to remove a vault full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they have no suitable areas for a fingerprint, but in this case, we have been able to gain the footprint of the hand and identify the offender who had participated in various flights," he recalled.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in cases of homicide.
Recently there was a man dead, with bottles of drinking around him.
For the intermezzo investigation has determined that a parent can be suspect of crime and a footprint on the cylinder coincided.
Even if no guarantees that it is not the killer, that puts him on the scene of the crime.
An ITC dactyloscopiste clarified that the excerpt from "the fingerprints of objects with reactive chemical or physical."
When they appear, using a préleveur or a band for the draw.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of déclinquents, or the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented aliens, showed the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is how the shows in the television programme.
As all that glitters is not gold, all that would be touching is not necessarily a footprint.
However, it can be used, when one realizes the confrontation necessary.
The "outraged" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators are before the place zuccotti for it to camp.
A lot of people have attained the evacuation order and was moved to a nearby Park.
The movement's ingrained with Wall Street have defied the authorities on Tuesday in New York in trying to enter again, thanks to a court order, in place of Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the dawn and when they tried to occupy another Park in the big apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators are before the place zuccotti, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allows "outraged" to stand again in the area, while the other part of the Movement has responded to the evacuation in a park north of the city, where there have been new rulings.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to stick to the place, we will move to a different place and we will continue the legal fight to return to zuccotti, and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations" dit-un spokespersons of the Movement "is Wall Street," mark Bray.
Bray explained that the response of "outraged" at the disposal of their camp personally dictated by the Mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to court, where the judge Lucy billings has issued an order banning the forced evacuation of the area and allowed the protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the "outraged" were in a new park located at the crossroads of Central Canal street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland tunnel, between New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity parish church.
For at least an hour they have managed to occupy the place, but after the police is inappropriate and has arrested several demonstrators, although Bray was not able to confirm the concrete figures, EFE the fact that he has seen a few journalists who had been handcuffed also.
The organization said that it was of centenarians of people who have come to this place, where a delegation of religious leaders came to show support for members of the movement and tried to speak out in favour of them before the police.
Meanwhile, the place zuccotti - which is a forum of private property, remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing under this Tuesday during which one must examine the legality of the evacuation of this morning.
Some demonstrators carried displaced so far and distributed by then copies of this judicial order and they were the same officials running the place, which has caused "some small clashes," said Bray, who has complained that some officials have hit the demonstrators.
The order prohibits judicial authorities to evacuate occupies on Wall Street or 'laws issued after the beginning of the occupation, barred from access to the park with tents and other properties that they used previously.
The Mayor Bloomberg said to the press that because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space for the public and the demonstrators, however, warned that the local laws do not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The Councillor has personally defended the evacuation at dawn to the place zuccotti, an operation during which was arrested 200 people and that is because of the fact that the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg has said that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it becomes "a place where people came to protest, but not to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people," because "some shops had received threats" and residents had fear in their quality of life.
"the evacuation of this morning at the dawn is repugnant and demonstrate the merits Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests than those of American workers," said the spokesman of the Movement, who accused the Mayor of "not respecting the freedom of expression."
"officials with Wall Street" have indicated that they do not think that holding "major efforts" to Thursday in collaboration with community-based organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protestes, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special television programme of Noel
Alongside Michael bublé Canadian and other celebrities, it will emerge in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of TIM Allen in "home improvement," helpers in "Baywatch," Rabbit in "Playboy," wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special programme of Noel of the Canadian Television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, in addition to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael bublé, and other well-known Canadian emerges in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" the next 1 December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV has distributed today of images from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the widely on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the batsman of "mötley crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in supporting in a nursery a doll representing Jesus.

Next to Anderson and Peters, Noel of CTV also presents the Canadian Singer bublé, who at the end of March was married in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model luisana lopilato, and that is not itself away from the controversy.

Japan returns after the earthquake
The GDP increase a 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral in the beginning of March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralysed, unsettle again after the devastating earthquake which has become nuclear crisis, the country's worst disaster Nippon since the Second World War.
The Government's initial estimate of Tokyo material losses were calculated at 300 million dollars, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have eased.
After three consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product data, between July and September contributed to definitively turn the page: GDP has risen a 1.5 percent compared with the previous quarter and a 6 percent in annualized rate.
Higher than the second quarter for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March, 2012, requires the highest rate of increase for the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery is due, in part, by the resumption of acquisition plan for restoring the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, the enterprises have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent, compared with the decline of 0.9 per cent capital observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of increase non-interrompue.
However, the true to stimulate the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian stimulus that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild the infrastructure, use the shortcomings in battering from scratch.
Japan had revived thanks mainly to the development of domestic consumption, which currently represents the Japanese 60 per cent of GDP.
This variable has risen a 1 percent, driven by increased spending on cars, travel and entertainment activities.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has surrendered to the internal market when the yen, Japan's currency, has become one of the "values refuge" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in eurozone and turmoil estimates Member nations, a privilege that weighs one slab in the export companies.
With a stronger divides, the products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, have been responsible for their poor results between July and September the contribution of the yen.
While the markets continue their seats in peripheral countries of the EU, the Government of yoshihiko Noda not be bullish.
"It must follow the remaining risks, as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the State Secretary for economic policy, motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not entirely positive.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the majority of member countries submitted in September clearer signals of economic slowdown.
The index, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy has emphasized that the major powers are constrained.
Since it has declined four digits to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone has even been above average, which is in the 100 level, dropping eight digits up to 99.13 points.
Athens is again the doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will sign no written commitment
With the peripheral triggered risk premiums and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that led to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling of that the "consensus" of the new transitional Government was imposed by the Greek demands from Brussels than a real belief of political forces is to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas papadimos reported yesterday that there is no alternative to the structural reforms and that the period of 100 days makes in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy Party, antonis Samaras, ensuring that it would not support the new austerity measures under any circumstances and reiterated her call for new elections for made scheduled debt, that of February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the summit on October 26," said papadimos yesterday when he opened a debate which is tomorrow with a parliamentary vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reforming the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras no emerging doubts about its position: "We are committed to assist the Transitional Government, but we are committed to nothing more than."
The leader conservatif went a step further in its pulse that EU and IMF, agencies that must release the 8,000 million that Athens must urgently, and made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment of adjustments.
But the European Commission, still angered by the impact caused by the last-minute bargaining chip of the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it does provide assistance if the new Greek Government and leaders of the main parties did not sign "a written commitment without ambiguities as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the Troika would "very quickly" return to Athens for talks with the new Government "the elements needed to pay the sixth installment" 8,000 million, even if there was a definite date.
The Greeks have a long way to go.
The Queen Sofía: "It is an instrument for the progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes the "predominant" place of Spain in connection with this type of finance
Spain "became a prominent place in the world level in the role of micro-financing."
The Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet on such an instrument of cooperation which "the essence" lies in the fact that he is a "tool for social development, justice and the hope for a better future for all humanity, based on trust in people."
The Queen opened yesterday the V-E World Summit of microcredit in Valladolid with certainty that "there is no doubt" that such operations are "absolutely essential" to achieve the goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very special, in which aims to reduce to half the volume of people with incomes under a dollar a day, which is set on the" poverty line ."
Spain continues to work "to" expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and took the task with" responsibility ," reported the Queen Sofía, who had hoped that the initiatives and the flows origins for the Summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the establishment of new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women ," the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have reached many goals," and "we are faced with many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum to debate, but also as a platform from which we must promote 'two goals ."
Thus, His Majesty has explained that the aim is that by the end of 2015 There are 175 million poor families who came to these financial services and that 100 million of them out of poverty line in which they now live.
The momentum in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path launched several years ago in a pioneering" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed the Queen Sofía as "an act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of the Convention as an idealistic "admirable in the global cause of poverty reduction," whose work it has since 15 years ago, when the Queen has traveled to Bangladesh for showing on the ground its lending policies.
This was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Cote d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "in every meeting I have seen sustained development," explained his Majesty, whose relationship with this project yesterday gave him the label of "head of family" at Valladolid on the part of the "deep pocket" for the poor.
Finally, the Queen Sofía ended his speech by encouraging people to participate in the discussion and the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"imperative ethics"
The Minister of External Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, warned that the solidarity is an imperative ethics "for a democratic State.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculer cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, because it is a "permanent duty."
Jimenez said that loans require "a serious and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and now "more than ever" they must work under the criteria of solidarity and do not allow it to be the victim of cuts.
For Spain, the microcredit is "one of the main lines of cooperation for development.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of "of confidence" to give people "excluded which all closing the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon of the Riva, welcomed the people in a city that contaminated "opens its doors to the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU nominated the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, passed without serious difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also serve as President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially to programme but has imposed in the fall, such as the activists who consider the Government's policy too lax of Greek today and possibly Italian tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
On 1001 delegates, only nine against and 10 abstaining.
The standing ovation for several minutes to which have been law, on the basis of their statements, Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Finance Minister, leaves no room for doubt.
The focus of the Chancellor, and the motion - under a slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less but more of Europe."
Not only because peace is the Europe but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "The time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could include modifications to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the supervision of the European Union on the fiscal policies of countries of the euro zone, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission to universal suffrage "to give a face to Europe."
That is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 27 quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders understand that Nicolas Sarkozy is illegal.
But the milestone.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to balance the weight of each country on the Board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of each economy, which obviously meant to strengthen Germany's weight.
To defuse the climate within his party, the Chancellor has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but it has not sought to win his Congress on the back of "small" European countries or countries in trouble quick to criticise the arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of the Franco-German friendship ,"" Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except at the bottom.
In recalling that two centuries, Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
That represents the fraud sick?
After the allowances, the UMP and the Government launched the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux to visit a box of family allowances, and deliver a speech on the recurrent theme - since 2007 - of the fight against social and welfare fraud.
And in support of the offensive, which stems from a desire to save money in a context of discipline, but is no less a harbinger of an axis of the presidential campaign to right, the majority wants to focus on sick leave.
In first for budget savings: the Government planned to impose the employees of the private a fourth day of deficiency before a work stoppage.
In clear, without specific business agreement, an employee who fell ill would lose four days' salary, so at least 15 per cent of their monthly income.
A measure that could lead to anger, but that would rescind 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic: impose staff with a day of deficiency uncompensated for absence from work, they have not so far of waiting, for three days in the private sector).
Although they are under discussion, the majority recovery also the theme of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you rembourserez," warned Xavier Bertrand at micro of RTL, Sunday November 13.
As in other cases, the stunts seem somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud to work stoppages.
Indeed, it is the subject of a constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which typically have borne fruit.
The French not more sick than elsewhere in Europe.
Take us to first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily allowances have been issued in 2006.
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation in health economics, the benefits were in 2008 5% health expenditures, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46 per cent maternity leave and workplace accidents, and 54 per cent were sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5 per cent of health spending.
In 2010, the French have experienced an average 14.5 days of work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Group Alma consulting.
An average that obscures the variations: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management site monster.com, showed that 75 percent of 40,000 French employees interviewed said they were taking no day of sickness.
Another study, this time of insurance, said that in 2010, 37 percent of sick leave were for less than 8 days, 22 per cent from 8 to 14 days, 15 per cent of 15 days to one month, 15 per cent of one to three months and 11 per cent.
When compared with their European neighbors, the French employees are not more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS showed that between 1994 and 2001, the rate of overall lack (for health reasons or not) in France, hovered between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 percent and 28 percent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or 16 percent and 18 percent in the Netherlands.
The fraud sick or very little face to work illegally.
As for the fraud, it reaches only a small scale.
The strengthening of the law since 2002 fact that systematic controls are on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, about 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13 percent of 285,000 made for periods of short were "unjustified or too long," or 37 050 case.
In the case of more than 45 days, systematically checked, there were 11 per cent of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" of 1.2 million, 132 million.
In total, therefore 169,000 case "unjustified," on several million employees have had a sickness.
A figure that is very little about, for example, the black work.
According to the UMP Deputy Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, more than the total cost of day, and therefore much more than the recent fraud.
Papadémos: Greece will implement a new plan adjustment
Greece will require another adjustment programme for economic recovery.
This is what Prime Minister said Monday, November 14, Lucas papadémos, before the Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his unity government would not be able to accomplish this task.
"to continue efforts for the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of Government, who said his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions made at the Summit of the euro zone on 27 October will be the main task of the new Government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Mr. papadémos has projected that the country's public deficit will be reduced "at around 9 percent" of GDP by the end of the year, after 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 percent in 2009.
The right-wing denied the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, has given its support for the measures already agreed on Monday to try to resolve the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not adopt on an additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, new democracy.
He agreed with the goal of reducing the deficit and debt, and to fight against waste but opposed any policy that bars the economic recovery.
A Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU do not débloqueraient lending of 8 billion euros needed without written guarantee to all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he will not sign under external pressure.
They legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, said a Committee of Experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and the doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian company live in denial about the death.
Only 9 percent of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and take appropriate measures to that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, with six experts linked in a variety of areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee called on the Government to amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, after which is imposed, with a patient felt competent to take such a decision.
From the outset, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, who described the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about the death."
Medicalization or not, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, we experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6 percent of them eventually die in the hospital.
Overall, the country is in Quebec that the rate is the highest, with 86 percent of the deaths occurring in hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are at odds with the position of the Federal Government, which has already said it will change nothing in the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all the countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalised, there is no evidence that this decriminalization might be abused in the application, including the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on people not competent or not willing.
On the contrary, said yesterday in teleconferencing Jocelyn downie, author of the report, would reveal many more cases of these excesses in the same country where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," said Jocelyn downie.
The Canadian support for euthanasia
Recall that 85 percent of Canadians have already voted in favour of the euthanasia because they think it would allow people in later life to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66 percent believe that to legalize euthanasia will not simply to send the message that the lives of the disabled or elderly people is worth less.
Those who assisted suicide, respondents to 41 per cent felt they should not be prosecuted.
In peacekeeping or cessation of care to a patient, the situation is less clear, say the authors of the report.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it is stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there was a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Panel also asked that the health professionals are trained the obligation to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In terms of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and the doctors are working together to ensure better palliative care, and this, beyond the cancer cases.
Finally, in terms of palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee urged that it be period, when it does not reduce the physical pain, as of euthanasia, and that it is subject to the same procedures.
The reserves of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Panel's report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre me Deschamps, a specialist in Health Law, called the "extreme" the position of the Signatories to the experts report, among other things, because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia for terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and to be more than 18 years might ask what it means to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted me yesterday a summary of the report.
Deschamps me also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that are part of the social fabric of the society.
However, "in society, it is the beacons and constraints."
The health law officer Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she referred to as "pro-euthanasia" manifesto.
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the data in the report about the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
The King of Jordan called on Assad to leave power
Damascus denounced a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar Al-Assad expressed yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Syria's Bashar Al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, their resistance and denounced a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of the country by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus as the neighbouring Jordan, Syria and Turkey, have come out in favour of a departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday, the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar Assad to "step down" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had about the interests of his country, he should resign, but it should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian politics," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
For its part, the head of the Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts since the beginning of the year to the Syrian regime have failed.
"those who are not in peace in the Middle East with their people and could not meet them depart," he said, referring to neighboring Syria, to which Turkey takes an increasingly hard-line.
The United States had also welcomed a "consensus building against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime," after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey adopt an increasingly tough tone" from repression in Syria, said mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces were killed in the region of Deraa, in southern Syria, announced the Syrian human rights monitoring (osdh).
Two other civilians were killed in an exchange of fire and shelling with heavy machine guns to jobar "in the besieged town of Homs, according to this Organization.
At a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem however, has estimated that the country was "headed for the end of the crisis."
Japan has reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus's work, which he viewed as "a very dangerous step."
Syria "will not falter," he added, asserting that "the plots hatched against Syria will fail."
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism to protect civilians" and the shipment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers in the country.
The French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed support for the dispatch of UN observers to help protect civilians of the regime's repression which sticks in the "paranoia."
A new special meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to review the implementation of the peace plan decided on November 2, including the withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from cities in the contest, and the release of those arrested.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, said yesterday "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the peace plan, while avoiding any support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to markets and sacrifices of the Italian
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has claimed a little time for markets to train his team and implementing a programme, which will "sacrifices" in order to recover the lost credibility in recent months of the Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussions with the political parties yesterday before meeting today with the unions and employers.
It should establish a relatively small firm of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti said an important program with a lot of sacrifices," said Francesco nucara, member of one of the many small groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council appointed.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, has for its part said to expect Mario Monti requested by a vote of confidence in Parliament Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr. Monti of a list, perhaps a dozen Ministers, the head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti explained the nervousness of equity and bond markets yesterday, asking them time.
In "democracy, there are specific time frame" to prepare a Government and its programme, he stressed, saying "he felt sure that the markets are patient and understanding."
The nomination by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but concern has taken over, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro zone in September.
The Prime Minister designate should form a team comprising mainly of technocrats, though he noted that he would include "political."
The new Government will last until 2013, when the next legislative, he felt.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will gain the confidence of the Parliament by Friday.
He has committed, once in line, to work in an urgent manner in order that Italy "become" player in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new Government, our analysis on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome would not achieve its goal of balanced budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, including new austerity measures.
The "patron of the Italian employers' Emma marcegaglia, who described Tuesday, also stressed the need to revive the economy," as a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit ."
Mr. Monti, known for his expertise and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme," the "Professor" symbolize "the serious challenge" and a "Italy," according to the writers.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
The Napolitano to avoid early elections, because Italy has to put up April 2012 for 200 billion of government bonds.
A Russian scientist has helped the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, said Monday an American NGO that specializes in nuclear risk.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report by the International Agency for the Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the United Nations agency to identify the researcher.
The IAEA reported last week its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear program.
According to ISIS largely from of the IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades in the 60 in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Urals), and was allegedly involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 and 1991, leaving the House to establish a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of the company he had contact with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before his return in Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA said Iran's "strong indications that the development" of a nuclear detonation system "has been helped by the work of a foreign expert who not only familiar with this technique, but who, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked for most of his career in this technology in the military nuclear programme in its country of origin."
The anti-Muslim crimes in increased by 50 per cent
The crimes against Muslims have increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time, other racial and religious violence has decreased slightly or progress, according to FBI statistics made public Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims is from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, against a 13 per cent rise in violence against Catholics, a decline of 4 percent of crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in crimes anti-religieux.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased marginally to 6,628 case, 47.3 percent which motivated by differences of race and 20 per cent by differences of religion, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes, increasing again," said the human rights organization, Human Rights First, "the increase of anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," said the Organization in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that the violence against the Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," said a senior member of the Organization, Paul legendre.
"the US government can and should do more to tackle such abuses, he adds," felt that this could be achieved by improving the police reports on the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in the US federal law is a legacy of the days of the struggle for civil rights.
The legislation was adopted following the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, ethnicity and now the sex.
Twitter modifies its platform and resembles more Facebook
The web of micro-blogging Twitter has introduced Monday, changes in his platform, especially to ensure its users to observe the work of those service, which is similar to a little more than Facebook.
A new tab "activity" and another "name" track more clearly, in direct the work of other "twittos" Internet users, it follows the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you.
It helps to know whether they take messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have any messages favourites, etc.
This new approach to Twitter was tested on a small percentage of users in August "before being distributed to the entire network Monday, indicated to AFP the Twitter spokesman, Carolyn penner.
Twitter, which was known for its operation just instinctive, with terms somewhat esoteric (RT to broadcast a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) being the happiness of insiders, opens it to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of public networks Facebook and Google +.
On the network, users struggle with "tweets" settled on the value of this innovation.
"It is unnecessary and intrusive, and it smacks too Facebook," written @ jemb123.
"The activity will help me to better monitor functionality elements of my flow Twitter," sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
Inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The Grand Social Democrat / Christian Democrat coalition government in power in Austria decided Tuesday to write into the Constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible slump by rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple-A).
This is the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced the decision after a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt amounts to 74.6 percent, well above the 60 percent ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt of countries like Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If the solvency of Austria was lowered by one notch, from AAA to AA +, we should pay three billion more in interest each year," argued the Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is following a request of the Brussels Summit of member countries of the euro zone's 26 October: Heads of State and Government were claimed by the end of 2012 the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the Constitution or in a law of equal value.
The measures adopted by the Austrian Government moved into the "model," the German was the first European country to adopt such a "Rule."
By 2017, the public deficit will decrease each year in structural 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural deficit by Federal should not exceed each year 0.35 percent of GDP, while the regional States as well as the common will provide balanced budgets.
The goal is to increase by 2020 / 21 public debt under the 60 per cent criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen strong
Noda threat of another intervention on the foreign exchange market
The Japanese Prime Minister, yoshihiko Noda, warned Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would intervene again on the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"we do as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
Tuesday, the yen was not far from historic levels that have pushed the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
That day, Tokyo has sold massive amounts of yen against the dollar in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency that had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has risen steadily since, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar has risen Tuesday under the 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last speech.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the dollar cotait around 120 yen, and the euro more than 160 yen.
The rise of the Japanese currency exports of the archipelago because it raises the cost of products made in Japan and reduces the value of earnings from overseas by Japanese firms, when they convert them in national currencies.
"Japan struggle to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and the tsunami of March 11 that have devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Mr Noda said that the rise of the yen does kill the fragile recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power has returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the quarter witnessed for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and domestic consumption incorporates by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister concluded that the high yen did not "reflect the economic fundamentals of Japan."
The Minister of Finance, Jun azumi, has for its part called on the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which opened Tuesday, a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governor of the institution, hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BOJ had already taken "appropriate measures," implying that no additional monetary easing was waiting for Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Institute is increased to 5,000 billion yen ($47 billion) from its purchases of Treasury bonds, raising to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling of its procurement amounts of various financial securities for flooding the market with cash.
Euro zone.
The rate rise, the scholarship flanchent
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis mine always European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and in Germany, the rate of fragile countries continue their ascent.
Still worried about the stability of the euro zone, the European stock exchanges are a little more in negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4 percent to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt assigns 0.4 per cent and London 0.1 per cent.
"with the new tensions on the yields of borrowing from the euro zone in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker among IG markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down by 0.7 per cent, who in turn fears of renewed market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the interaction will continue in a narrow corridor of changes as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said mitsushige Akino, a Fund Manager at ichiyoshi investment management.
This renewed concerns over the future of the euro zone weaken the single currency, which continues to fall Tuesday.
The euro changes to its lowest level for a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the currency union is 1,3570 dollar, down 0.4 percent.
According to brokers, it fell after the Chancellor's party Angela Merkel, the CDU Congress, held Monday, has adopted a motion including the possibility for a country struggling to emerge from the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6 per cent
The mortgage rate of Italy and Spain are very disturbing.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on the 10-year Italian bonds reached 6.85 percent, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2 per cent.
These tensions on interest rates from the South, but also in France, further fuelling fears of speakers.
The head of the future Government Italian Mario Monti has claimed the markets' time to restore the situation in Italy is threatened by asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos has himself, said that the implementation of the decisions made at the Summit of the euro zone on 27 October would be the "main task" of his Government.
Spain is in the line of fire of markets, then held Sunday for legislative elections in the country.
The rate gap ("spread" between the obligations to 10 years of Germany and Spain has reached a new above historic.
Waiting for the figures for growth of the euro zone
Statistics aside, France has achieved an economic growth of 0.4 percent in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3 percent expected, brought by private consumption.
However, the INSEE revised the figure for the second quarter, with a decline of 0.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
And, this is truly the fourth worries that most economists.
Germany, for its part, has recorded a growth of 0.5 percent over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has warned against the risk of a double-dip recession.
Energy policy.
The facts must prevail on the dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be addressed based on considerations of short term or the "emotion is good energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is right for a electoral rendezvous is the opportunity to reflect on these issues and to the place that is the nuclear.
The debate will only be successful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the options.
The French opinion on objective data, sound.
While we are 7 billion, "human beings on the planet, demographic developments" will a doubling of the demand of electricity by 2050, at least to deprive a huge proportion of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, we must address the depletion of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity, not forgetting the urgent need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to combat climate change, disappeared from an environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon the nuclear.
This has not been the case in Belgium, which makes the supports the need to find a source of replacement alternative, or of Switzerland, which will just not building any more than the last generation plants.
By contrast, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, for example, continue their projects with determination.
The US have decided after Fukushima added one at their park with the construction of a central adjourned after the accident at Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focus on renewable energy, is sometimes cited as an example, the reality will upset the speech.
The choice of Berlin will lead to the rise in the price of electricity, energy dependence is aggravated by the increasing reliance on imported gas, in particular Russia, a jump of CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal power plants.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to entertain.
European champions of the wind, which has 30 percent of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas because of the intermittent winds; as a result, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the resilience of our energy policy, our neighbours paid a bill of electricity 40 per cent higher than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy, the cost of power is a key factor for competitiveness and a guarantee for the maintenance of the industrial base on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheaper electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear brought a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory fine words on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, because they lack of opposition in principle to the energy, the polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has helped build an industry of 125,000 jobs directly and 410, 000 jobs.
Strong exports, it involves a galaxy of SMEs agencies on the international market and makes them very job-creating non-transferable.
If France were to agree to phase out nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by greatly reducing the annual EUR 6 billion of French exports of nuclear facilities and services.
What compelled an electrician EPR designed to operate sixty years while the decline in its manufacturer would be scheduled?
To resolve the "energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no other source of production of" miracle electricity, any more than there is of evil.
The development by Areva of gas-intensive solutions of CO2, nuclear energy, attests to the complementarity of power sources.
For the nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute imperative.
We have a security authority in France which oversees intransigent and transparent on existing plants as site of flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is acknowledged to be inhabited by the same security obsession.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, spoke in normal operation; he remained without human and environmental consequences.
A Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.
A Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident resulted from two unprecedented natural disasters, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from the accident, as it had for the previous two.
Result of the task and the cooperation between the security authorities, the French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR reflects an approach to making it capable of withstanding such phenomena.
Although it is considered by all electricians wanting to build a nuclear power station, halting its construction to flamanville would be a wonderful gift offered to competitors of Areva and EDF, leaving the way open for leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek out the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow the "emotion, dogma and partisan tactics to dominate a debate as critical to the economic, financial and social situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized in various angles -engorgement of police, judicial and administrative services subject to figure, this policy is compatible with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, the administrative harassment against foreign students who was widely reported, the Minister of the Interior (read release may 23) declaring that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant."
But it is rarely discussed in economic terms.
There was a broad consensus on this subject between left and right.
A right-wing, the tone has been set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976, "¥900 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where nearly 2 million immigrant workers," and there, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country by hordes of Polish plumbers are split on the left and right.
For both sides, the immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and the society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that opinion be given towards immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Holland is confined to the mundane, indicating that the co-development will solve our migration "problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, that is perhaps off going; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book highlighting the latest knowledge on immigration (orphans: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of immigration into the economic growth, employment and wages in the country who are immigrants.
Restrict immigration anaemic growth and employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they may have to substitute for domestic workers, particularly the low-skilled, putting downward pressure on their salaries.
But experience shows that, in reality, the immigrants are much more complementary as substitutes for employees, speaking for the national essential in the sectors in employment shortage.
The low-skilled immigrants working in areas that do not attract the national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic in which the training does not offer of jobs.
A positive effect on salaries
In the same way as a surgeon will be hard put to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between national and migrants that the influx of immigrants have a positive effect on the national employment and wages.
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1 per cent of migration is set to increase between 0.6 and 0.9 per cent of real wages in the long term.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity of the immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and the economic growth (high proportion of immigrants naturalized among American Nobel; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants are net contributors of social systems, an average of one per cent of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, estimates that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 years will contribute net income less expenditure of 150 euros to public budgets on average on the whole of his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wants, at the beginning of the mandate, find the missing growth areas "teeth."
The teeth in question, serve to discourage immigrants, have had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, continues to believe the European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a quite fragile.
The European continent should remember him who, for having invented in Athens over 2,000 years ago, has been in the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some might have thought he would, and democracy triomphât permanently from its enemies, of the vote, and to exercise in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "the small," that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even be "instrument of oppression" in the words of the old philosopher Republican Etienne vacherot.
No, democracy requires something more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation of powers and control, education, and economic and social solidarity, a justice.
The crisis in Europe as an economic crisis, but it is equally and first of a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodie of Greek vrai-faux referendum will have had double indicative value: the need for a strong return of politics, but also the disturbing sense of failure, its incongruity.
This ambivalence is thought to be exceeded.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic contest are now displaced, and that, for many of them, the Republicans no longer have soldiers in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by requiring a succession of national referendums on one's needs and fragmented.
A blank cheque to the absolute monarch European or jump on foot attached in the vacuum of nationalist: What choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want to sunset but an exercise, common, of course, calm, and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, could not be more where to stop the "list, since only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is as Europe to succumb to the dictates of the market and rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which was humiliated on the international scene.
There is concern about transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but the whole Europe which is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The top priority is to restore people's sovereignty to the European project.
Because it is that the Europeans can work together to reduce the weight of their debts, emerged from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The emergency exit will involve decisions at European level which can be taken without a full democratic legitimacy, unless, of course, to get us to disaster.
After long fought the proposal of Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world now wants the European economic government.
Either.
But the show without a stronger democratic and political integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be another madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the building of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was' do 'for Republicans.
The revolution in the interests will not suffice.
That lesson is still valid.
We have to build a more integrated Europe economically.
This can be done only by building a more democratic in the political arena, a genuine European popular sovereignty.
In Europe, are Europeans.
The smart cards "without contact" spread
The global lounge of the card begins Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
The year 2011, expected to complete on a rise of 11 percent of global sales of smart card (credit card, telephone with SIM card...), to more than 6 million units, according to the Cabinet eurosmart.
The most promising sector is without contact technology that allows to pay public transportation or simply to settle its purchases in approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards without contact should be sold throughout the world, from 320 million a year earlier.
Their share is expected to grow by 2012 (580 million units expected) and represents nearly 10 percent of the global market of the smart card (6,925 million cards).
Long in the wake of the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for the payment without contact.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, are more modest beginnings: 400,000 cards without contact visa had been deployed.
But department stores are twice as hard.
Carrefour has thus issued this year 2.5 million cards pass MasterCard without contact.
To move up a gear, banks now have to equip their clients.
"two major French institutions have pledged to make the future systematically equipped for the cards to their clients without contact," said Gerard nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
The banks are testing the payment by mobile
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Little devices are now equipped with the technology NFC (near field communication) needed to conduct business.
"they were behind."
"but they should finally have a real boom next year."
"We rely on the sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 in the world," said Marc Bertin, President of eurosmart.
But the banks to take the lead.
The agricultural credit yesterday announced the launching of a test from December to next June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 clients and staff will be equipped with a pouch authorizing the payment without contact.
The bpce has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the company, too, said yesterday the placing on the market of an offer to allow its customers to pay without contact with their motive.
The Western in Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about links between Al-Qaida and the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram.
Long suspected, the relationship between the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM *) and the Nigerian cult Boko Haram continued.
Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers was now "satisfied."
"the two organizations operate and intelligence reports showed that there is cooperation," he said without being more specific.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French in Niger last January had uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of AQIM *, Antoine de léocour and Vincent Delory should be killed the following day with several of their captors during an operation by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, the French investigation and Niger to regain phone chips belonging to terrorists.
Axis terrorist
The analysis of calls made to several sources based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues particularly interested investigators: one leads to a Niger, who has traveled extensively in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, cradle of Boko Haram and one from a man who was close to AQIM * and of the sect.
"This is a step forward, but it is probably more formal wait for evidence before talking about operational cooperation between AQIM * and Boko Haram."
"but it is possible."
"It has been clear for years that the cult is outside of intellectual and financial support and that it is increasingly active," moderates kunle amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months the "support" had been increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram, or in business practices, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosives in increasingly complex and invoice as that used by AQIM *.
The international community, including Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of visionaries little of interest.
A rapid success
Founded in 2002 to Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and fundamentalist Imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin,," calls for the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In the poor region, the Association has a rapid success.
It is politicized and demand a strict adherence to the sharia as its militants moving the ungodly fight against the central Government.
They target churches, bars, authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram is active, launching attacks against police stations.
Abuja's response is, as usual, unsubtle.
The Army gave the city, 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested living, was killed in prison.
Therefore the sect will radicalize and leave its Northern strongholds.
At last Christmas, she claims to have an attack that left 80 dead in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram takes the secure Headquarters of the police in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations International will be its first target.
The creation of a major terrorist in Africa which is operating from Mauritania to Somalia in Nigeria is now all security specialists.
While AQIM * has invested to Mali and Niger, the Somalis to al-chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, at a meeting in Nigeria with the President Jonathan Goodluck, Alain Juppé warned Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all information."
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete on simplicity and ignorance.
An America that was weakened by the crisis can manage a complex world with simple ideas, even simplistic?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and other increase the thundering speeches and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strength.
On China, Iran, on aid to Israel, slogans, often unsubstantiated, mounts.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner in the race for the nomination of the "grand old party," has threatened to drag the Chinese in the WTO and cause "for their" currency manipulation, a divisive issue in an America exasperated by the migration of chunks of its industry in Asia.
Too bad if it must involve the onset of a trade war, he said.
Jon huntsman, Budapest-based Obama in China and only one candidate to have a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, has threatened to strangle faced with an attitude that 'proud' emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing, Obama's current position).
But huntsman, standing in the polls, remains muted.
In the image of Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will stop Iran, he fanfaronné."
"If Obama is re-elected," they will have the bomb.
It has also pledged to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in its duty to the partner.
The contractor Herman Cain, the best placed second, poster for an embarrassing breach of the files.
Recently, he called to counter China's military threat because Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear capability," apparently unaware of the fact that China holds the atom military since 1964.
The Texas governor man Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants military strikes against Iran, and was ready to commit the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also being promoted by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are a long way from the Republican candidate for 2008, John McCain, in a foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and we won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to give some ground on anti-terrorism.
They insisted on the failure of its naive dialogue with Iran, on the rushed departure of "boys" of Iraq, on its procrastination in Libya, sucking him along a small label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is rather positive stock of national security of Obama, who eliminated bin Laden.
In Iraq, it is wary of military action that led to the stalemate.
And so, arguing that it must rebuild economically Latin to resuscitate its leadership, Obama was more fair.
The North Stream, new ntrée door of Russian gas to Europe
The North Stream, directly linking Western Europe to Russia from the bottom of the Baltic Sea, was put into operation.
It must provide gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to mark the event with flashing.
More than 500 guests including four heads of State and Government attended, last Tuesday, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between orchestra and buffet North end, at the inauguration of the stream, the new pipeline that connects directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the first French Minister Francois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned all the steering wheel of the valve Commander the entry of Russian gas in the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas more will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1,224 km link from St. Petersburg to land of State.
A second tube should be completed by the end of 2012, to issue a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the equivalent of the entire French consumption.
And there is already talk the opportunity to build a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time of this huge yard has reminiscent of victory.
The project has been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will allow us to deliver gas directly in Germany, avoiding any land crossing through a third country, Poland and Ukraine).
As a result, the two countries lose some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close access to West European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the North Stream to a "new Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact," in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, for Poland in 1939.
That means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, through its support to the Russian initiative, has won a greater security of supplies.
But that was because of a weakening of European energy, as the project has created a rift between West and East Europeans.
The Federation, in just five years, upholding its vision of a direct alliance between the Federation and the rich Western countries, strong gas consumers, and whose deposits are in decline.
"The pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organically," confirmed Fillon when opening the pipeline, demonstrating how the big gas contracts are also to political and economic.
All this demonstrates the broad smiles posted by the leaders of Gazprom, present in number to lubmin, gas at the finish.
The construction of the pipeline is also a technical feat.
The steel tube is gainé padding to protect them from the anchors of ships.
It is based on the bottom of the Sea, to 200 m on average.
To build it, and we had to prevent minefields from the Second World War.
"about 100 had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Miller, company spokesperson North Stream.
It has also meant more measures to protect wildlife.
The tube is a long snake of heavy metal, as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: valve, or maintenance station.
A platform to control was set off in Sweden, but have abandoned the project when the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian State company to be permanently off their coasts.
"In case of failure, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," said Jens Miller.
In case of a leak, the gas in the pipeline is released in the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have foreseen the welds to ascertain the flight every 100,000 years.
The State oversight of the pipeline is provided by a robot submarine, dragged by a foreign ship, for observation, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline.
In the form of a cigar, he was introduced to the interior of the tube, off one meter in diameter, and it is being pushed by the gas.
On arrival, after three days of travel at 3 meters second, providing accurate information on possible distortions of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to work 50 years without any compensation.
The flow of gas is simply provided by the pressure.
It is 200 bars on arrival, and 100 departure.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out the project.
The leader is Gazprom, which retains 51 percent of the shares.
Joined in the German E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group Suez GDF (9 per cent each).
These five companies have established a joint venture, called North Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where the tax is particularly welcome.
Gazprom then leased to the company, renewable for 20 years, all of the transport capacity of gas.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas really carried," said Jens Miller.
The construction of the pipeline has received 30 per cent by the shareholders and to 70 per cent of bank loans.
The total cost of the project is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are safe to return to their cost, since only Gazprom took the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic to lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted pine.
The valves, high of 4.5 metres, formed the exit door of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and the characteristics of the gas to, before it was transferred to the German lines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a road mark.
Established 15 years ago by an Italian company, the moleskine to give a taste of the script.
It smacks of adventures, of hours to write in the light of a candle.
The Carnet moleskine is easily recognizable, with its coverage rectangular black, his elastic, its white sheets a colour broken, as aged by the time.
However, the Carnet moleskine as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company modo modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a notebook design but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then as a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The book is a former production technology, the mole skin (skin of mole) as a cotton varnish used to cover the bench seats by example.
That book was very popular among the writers and passengers.
"moleskine handed the taste of a subject old and forgotten, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, up in the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, now the leader of the mark for much less.
The success is.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales have increased by 26 per cent to $12.7 million pieces passed.
This is a far cry from the production of confidential early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Italian moleskine transcends borders and is exported in 70 countries, France to the United States.
Difficult to establish an image of the buyer, because the notebook attracts both the businessmen that the student and professionals.
In the image of moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The Italian company, who had 12 employees in its infancy, with almost 100 today and for 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and one in New York.
It distributes its books in bookstores, of the FNAC to small stores in downtown and was able to impose its identity.
"We have followed the air time and this new clerical, despite the boom of e-mail," said Maria Sebregondi.
This signature with the development of cultural moleskine: recently, the mark has launched a "detour" exhibit where architects and artists put their own book.
In August, it has also launched coverage in leopard, at the Locarno film festival.
Taking advantage of its cultural success and this will, moleskine was able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer accessory... the mark is on a wide range of media.
A success that made the envious: in the fall of 2006, much less had been bought by the Investment Fund SG capital Europe today syntegra capital, writing a new chapter in the history of moleskine.
Why the unemployment rate of disabled workers remained so high?
About 19 percent of disabled persons are in search of work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a proactive policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is two times higher than the average: 19 percent, compared with 9 percent for the whole of the population.
Depressing?
"No," said Eric blanchet, Director General of the increase, the Association, which organizes the week for "employment of the disabled.
"the progress made since 15 years" are considerable.
"at the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"but there is still much to do."
It must be said that for the unemployed disabled, there remain many obstacles before assuming the job.
Instead, they are age: 37 percent are over 50 years old (17 per cent on average).
They have a low level of skill: 80 percent did not the pan and on the 2.3 million students, only 10,000 have disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53 per cent for the disabled from 38 per cent on average.
Short, complicating criteria singularly return to work, and "form the crux of the problem," according to Christian grapin, Director-General of springboard, an association established in 1992 to help firms to hire disabled workers.
So much for the brakes goals.
Is the unspoken, changing attitudes, certainly, but too slowly.
A survey in April by the Association ims-entreprendre for the city indicated that managers interviewed "a low level of awareness of disability," with a "overrepresentation of wheelchair users, or mentally impaired intellectual."
Result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the goal of 6 percent of disabled workers, set in an Act of 1987.
The last known figures, from 2008, showed a ratio of 2.6 percent.
"We are now around 3 percent," said Pierre White, Director-General of the agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting donations for companies that do not respect the law.
The evidence: the number of schools "taxed," as the amounts, declined between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"the law, which increased the contributions, has created a great deal of pressure on the companies, said Pierre white."
"But this also reflects a real awareness, particularly in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82 percent of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "that of happiness"
Prior to confront the blue Tuesday evening (20h45) Eden hazard and Georges leekens had not hidden the pleasure that the friendly match.
You're not going so far as to say that there is collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Auditorium of the stage of France, Georges leekens and EDEN hazard have made peace.
Five months after the gesture of mood of his attacking against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise for doing about it.
"I am very happy, be of Eden, its progress and its Belgian."
"I want to move forward," extends its hand the lillois.
The contrastre between its club and selection, "This is a totally, has justified."
"I am a Lille, throughout the year, which is not the case with the Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Spared against Romania on Friday evening for the match against France, hazard comes in Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Without fail, however, the concept of "pleasure."
The Blue, encouraging since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been bear," he says.
Inevitably, this is to further strengthen the "particular" nature of the event.
To do anything in the face, "it is Mathieu (debuchy), yohan (cabaye) and Adil (RAMI) ," rapelle-t-il.
"We sat on earlier."
"to play against them, that happiness!
With bonhomie, leekens also referred to the "pride."
In "pride" contest "a gala match."
"pride" in this quality of "neighbour" - that France has "returned a very High-Level Team" a little more than a year after the trauma of knysna.
"Laurent Blanc has been a work of thunder," has excited.
While Belgium will miss the next euro, the operator would be well share the aircraft with the blue direction... Brazil in 2014.
"our small Belgian become major," he stressed.
"It is in the process of building something, the players are ambitious, starving."
"you will be clear in the next matches," one against France.
Portugal very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento began with many optimistic its dam return to Bosnia (during), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
Was the move, the two teams had failed to realism.
"at the end of the 90 minutes, we are a good team and, above all, a happy country '.
Paulo Bento had been already, Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt, the selecçao, which he is to hand since September 2010, will qualify for the euro 2012.
Portugal is available only to 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to destabilise.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in the inferno of Zenica, it appears clear that the Games are not being made.
Portugal has dominated the party for more than an hour, but it has been unable to score that goal so valuable, who relieved.
"This is a good result, which poses a risk, however, because we do not have to score a goal on the outside"
But in their homes, illuminated the Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before a public that should be bouillant here, too, even though the party would be obviously very tightly, Dixit a Bento optimistic but lucid.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are fully confident we can win," said the Portuguese coach for 42 years.
"We continue to have a 50 per cent chance of taking the euro 2012," has downplayed the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The Bosnian no reported Friday, forcing the Portuguese to mark and profits.
A person can suffice for Bosnians, who also needed to score.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain risk because we do not have to score a goal to the outside," regrets Bento.
"We will play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities, in which players with great personal qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese entry will have the intention to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, but to be realistic, this time.
