The lack of snow in the mountains is worrying the hotel
Not only telesquíes peacekeepers in krkonoše concern them runways without snow .
The lack of snow makes people do not set aside ski stays in hotels and pensions .
That is why , in krkonoše can still be achieved rooms free for all the winter dates , including for Christmas Eve and Year 's Eve .
We have many visitors in our pages .
People looked tenders , checked , but prices still is afraid of maintaining with commitment .
And if we call , they ask immediately on our opinion , if this Christmas will have snow or mud , " mentioned the mantenedor information portal spindl.info Martin jandura .
Those who want to move in špindlerův mlýn a year 's eve according to their expectations , should not hesitate in reserve stay .
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation secondly , may try to wait a few more days .
The špindlerův hotel owners ' mlýn offer particularly weekly stays for Year 's Eve .
I believe that will offer , but will soon and will provide shorter stays .
And then the rooms free will be sold quickly , estimated jandura .
Ingotours , a travel agency of vrchlabí beds , continues to offer free for all the dates of winter .
Now , what interests us most is the Christmas week , which is not yet complete .
Half of places offered remains free .
That is why we have already prepared some Christmas stays last-minute " mentioned the director of ingtours Petr schiefert .
The travel agency of vrchlabí still can also provide New Year 's Eve in krkonoše , but there are fewer places free .
Sold well also the first fourteen days February , the remaining winter dates are sold regulate .
This year the interest in the winter stays is harmed by the lack of snow in krkonoše .
People are waiting to see whether there will be snow .
Nobody wants to move to the end of the year in the mountains without snow .
If the clues remain snowfall during the week , the dates of Christmas will run out , " also believes schiefert .
On the contrary , it is somewhat easier to occupy in the hotel rooms horizont in Pec pod sněžkou ; last year was more difficult .
We are roughly five per cent better .
For Christmas and the New Year 's Eve , we have the latest places .
The interest increases during Polish holidays in January and February also sells well , " reported by the director of the best hotel in SGP , Karel Rada .
Eighty per cent of the New Year 's Eve stays are already engaged in the hotel Omnia , about parking central to janské lázně .
On the contrary , in the most recent hotel janské lázně at Christmas half of the beds is still free .
This January was a great surprise to us , because we are about to sixty percent of the capacity of occupation .
February has been somewhat weaker , but when it comes to fall snow , interest through the rooms in krkonoše could only increase , mentioned Erik sporysch , the director of the hotel Omnia .
However , at the moment it seems that a hotel keepers of krkonoše they pass the appetite of snow waiting .
On Thursday , should fall temperatures , and if there are rainfall , in the mountains should nevar .
But then again temperatures will rise , reported Jiří jakubský of Hradec Králové , of hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic .
The USA : repetition is the mother of wisdom
Is comical that Barack Obama , the President with the reputation of men more intelligent , as a pupil diligent repeated in the Afghan question strategy of its predecessor , which he himself took by the most stupid .
When finally revealed its Afghan approach , been looking forward , demonstrated that there is a copy of the script used to Iraq by Bush , established three years ago .
Not only in the same text is used several times the phrase ' like " in Iraq , but is also not hesitate to use the title of Bush 's statement January 2007 for their own statement : " a new way forward ' .
Was himself , who , three years ago , criticized the idea of Bush sending out new military reinforcements to Iraq , the country that is suffering from the civil war ; and this criticized it as " an irresponsible decision and with catastrophic consequences . "
The following months , however , showed that Bush 's strategy , based on the recommendations of captains , was the only possible and successful so today is not spoke none of Iraq in the news .
The reputation of Bush did not improve , however objectively left its successor an initial situation much more favourable than could have been expected .
In Afghanistan , Barack Obama anticipated the miracle .
The captains of area again ask you to increase the military contingent , especially the commander-in-chief of the general Afghan operation Stanley mccristal . It , even despite the traditional subordinate relations , proceeded to rifles undecided in the White House to a criticism hard .
Requested 40,000 men in order to improve the situation .
The President wavered over three months , but it happened nothing better , so that at least misled the general on 10,000 military .
Managed to ensure that Europe has promised to another 5,000 , although he previously had at least 10 000 .
The problematic thing about the whole strategy of its objective , Obama seems to start withdrawing troops of Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this procedure in three years ; the whole doctrine of Obama generate more questions from the answers it offers .
Many doubt that the increase in the same fruit that the procedure in Iraq .
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years , the society of Iraq is relatively well organised , their leaders respect agreements .
The situation in Afghanistan is different : it is not possible to rely on anyone and not complied with any agreement .
Under these circumstances it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces , if they are accustomed to change the head every day according to their needs .
Political institutions , although formally laid down , will remain just a Potemkin village after he will remain patriarchal tribal relations .
To balance the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely complicated because of confusing relationships , even more complicated by the Pakistani influence and Iranians .
Even establish a state that is " action " , a minimum target for the entire operation , it seems very real .
The horizon of the strategy of Obama collides for her proactive approach .
During the past eight years , the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and now it is about to explode .
Only a romantic soul , who do not know nothing of reality could believe that the military sent to war to " soon return home , " will do some miracle here .
From a political point of view , setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility , since the Taliban will consider it as an indirect declaration of the American defeat .
The recent NATO Summit showed that Europeans have less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan .
European politicians do not know , and neither do they want to explain to their electorate , what relationship has the security of Germany or Italy with the war with the Hindu Kush .
The other factor , capable of affecting radically to the situation , is the development of events in Iran .
If the situation continues to deteriorate and increased sanctions had no effect on the Iranians , the US will have to take a difficult decision : to try to solve the problem by military force or not .
It will be necessary to find the answers precisely when , according to Obama , America initiate the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan .
However , each solution as well will mean a setback dramatic for the Afghan situation .
The only positive point to Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years for the presidential elections and so much time to find another strategy , whichever is a total failure .
The directors of the bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the cash bonuses
The senior executives of American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year the bonuses in cash .
The entity as announced to react to the harsh criticism of its practices of salary .
The group of 30 senior managers receive , instead of money , measures cannot be sold at a minimum period of five years .
Furthermore , actions may be withdrawn in the event that had assumed excessive risks .
According to Reuters , Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to unite the bonuses in Wall Street with the long-term power .
I assume that Wall Street is fully aware of the longest journey that should undertake , mentioned the banking former investor in the entity JPMorgan Douglas Elliott .
The devil is in the detail , added .
The bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism having subparagraph almost $ 17 billion ( almost 300 billion CZK ) for the bonuses , in the first three quarters of this year .
The sum total bonuses in the entity for this year , according to the Reuters , probably exceeds , despite the announced measure today , the $ 20 billion .
The high bonuses in the banking sector became , with the arrival of the financial crisis , in a sensitive issue in politics .
Great Britain announced on Wednesday hanging tax at once , with a tax of 50 % , the banking bonuses for exceeding the 25,000 ( approximately GBP 712.000 CZK ) .
France is also preparing similar measures .

The Minister janota considers the resignation Klaus I invited the castle .
The President Václav Klaus will receive the Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard janota , which is considering his continued rule , since it does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year , adopted on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies .
It is assumed that the budget , and perhaps also the permanence of janota in the cabinet , will be the topics of its meeting on Friday .
The budget is also criticised by Klaus .
According to him , the deficit is too big , which continues to deepen the crisis in public finances .
On the quotation reported by the spokesperson for the President radim ochvat .
On their stay in the role , janota wants to negotiate on Monday , with Prime Minister Jan Fischer .
According to the law on the budget , ready to be signed by Klaus , the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163,000 million kroner .
The Chamber of Deputies , however , adopted on Wednesday , the proposals of the left to transfers of funds and increased the money for the salaries of officials , social services and direct payments to farmers .
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats , because covertly increase the budget deficit .
Between left on the one hand and the government , Klaus and right on the other , there was a serious conflict of internal policy . Due to this conflict , are beginning to be controversial future activities of the bureaucratic cabinet Fischer form , which was agreed in spring by ODS , čssd and the Green Party .
Critics claim that the budget , in the version adopted by the Chamber of Deputies , de facto clears the package of measures ahorrativas , imposed in autumn by the government of Fischer to curb the public debt .
Klaus can but must not sign the law on the state budget ; today stated during a breakfast with entrepreneurs that politicians time-consuming neglecting " the serious problem " , i.e. the deficit does not " sustainable " of public finances .
According to him today no longer have a good solution .
Only a strong government that can draw on a broader consensus among the political parties , could improve this situation , does the President .
The leader of ODS Mirek Topolánek mentioned , that the budget is appalling and that the government should think its future existence .
The vice-chairman of ODS Petr Nečas , said to čtk that the concept of the bureaucratic cabinet with the support of čssd , ODS and Greens obviously no longer works .
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and described similar words " strong " judgments .
The head of čssd , Jiří Paroubek , reacted to Topolánek by saying that the budgetary deficit is appalling , prepared for this year by former Topolánek government . Outstrip the 200 000 million .

Mandela in the new movie of clint Eastwood , interpreted by Morgan freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie , invictus : invincible , speaks volumes about the country , their fight and its victories , although some criticisms say that the roles played by the American actors protagonists .
History spoke of sport , race relations and Nelson Mandela .
The tireless campaigner against the racist regime of apartheid in South African Republic and its first black President Nelson Mandela , is interpreted in its biography by the American player Oscar-winning winner , Morgan freeman .
Freeman said that Mandela , 91 , told him to construe Eastwood in the film .
Another important role it plays Matt Damon .
I said : " When I interpreted , I will have to have access to you .
The main player seventy-two years , who received the prize for his role in the drama of Eastwood about the world of milion boxing dollar baby , played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery , which ended slave , fictitious of the US President , and even of God in Evan Almighty . But rarely represented someone who is still alive and , for many people , is as important as Mandela .
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for their efforts to put an end to apartheid in the Republic of South Africa .
He was released in 1990 and for four years became President of the country .
In 1993 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
Invictus invincible - is a Latin word and the title of a poem by author English William Ernest henley , published in 1875 .
The challenge was to speak as he
The film is a real story on Nelson Mandela , who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team , Francois Ms. pienaar , to help unite the country . Mandela , the new President , knows that after their nation remains apartheid racial and economically divided .
Believes that is able to unite to its people through sport , and that is why it was decided to unite rugby players , which belong in the global measure to the marginalised .
The South African team can reach the World Cup in 1995 .
Freeman worked several years for the history of Mandela reached cinemas .
He has no other aim to play this role in such a way as to be as similar as possible to reality , said freeman .
Of course , the greatest challenge was to speak like him .
The actor said that if he and the global political outside of the same area , had tried to meet with Mandela , dine with him , be behind the scenes before your speech .
Most importantly , I wanted to estrecharle out to Mandela .
I discovered that the apretarle hand , I receive your energy , it is transmitted and was a sense of how you feel , said .
For me , it is important to try to become a different person .
Matt Damon plays the role of François Ms. pienaar , the captain of the national team in rugby , the dominant white players .
The actor said have had six months to prepare for a role in the tough Rugby World .
A great surprise to it was he who , when finally met for the first time with MS. pienaar at home .
I remember having called the door , he opened up and the first thing that I said to François Ms. pienaar in my life was : " in the film parezco much higher . "
Despite the obvious differences between characters of the actors involved and their real models , and under the management of the director Eastwood , invictus : invincible received positive profiles and speaks of ambitions for the Óscar .
The film critic of the magazine daily variety Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words : ' was a story very good , a film very well done . "
In the profiles of films on the website rottentomatoes.com , invictus received 76 % of positive assessments .
The secret of glory on Norway resolved : Russians a missile testing
On Norway , there was a special shining effect of unknown origin .
Russia 's Ministry of Defence ended recognizing yesterday that near the border with Norway made an intercontinental ballistic missile tests .
The launch failed again . The missile ' bulava " , previously intended to be proud of the Russian army , is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Mr Putin .
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests has had the desired impact on the success of the test flights .
Bulavá , in most cases , it was not flying or there was a fault in the air .
In Russian newspapers write ' bulavá " as " a missile not flies . "
A missile that flies , but not shone .
During this , the 13th test , there was initially any problem .
At the end of the flight again saw technical problems in the apparatus .
Probably the engine broke out in the third stage of the missile .
This time bulavá " " was launched since the nuclear submarine Dmitry donskoy unattended , drowned in the White Sea .
This kind of the missile launch from a boat that is moving and black is at once .
That is why it is likely that the light mysterious on Norway , caused by an object wheel not identified , in reality outside the failed " bulavá . "
The Norwegians unchanged since the outset remain unwavering concerned a missile Russian .
The generals this time advocating affirming that we cannot simply talking about a failure .
The first two stages of the aguantaron missile and general occurred in the third .
In the previous cases accidents occurred , each involving Dash8 engines immediately in the first stage .
Although none of launches passed completely without errors , according to the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen were lost .
The success of almost fifty per cent full of optimism to the generals and thus continued saying that " bulavá " one day will fly without problems and that even will succeed until ten hipersónicos blocs , whose total weight is full of 1.15 tonnes .

Hyundai met the requirements of the trade unions cancels any extra work .
The leadership of the car factory in nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all extra work .
Precisely because of the frequent extra work , unions stated on Monday , the emergency by strike .
The information was confirmed by the spokesperson , Petr vaněk factory automoviles Hyundai .
The leadership , however , wants for this year to agree with the unions a question Saturday more .
We cannot resign ourselves to our plan of manufacture , because that is essential . That is why we proposed voluntary supplementary working for Saturday 19 December , that is to say , it will work in two shifts , said vaněk .
According to the sedmička.cz server , the company offered a bonus CZK 400 employees who work Saturday 's question .
The bonus also will be paid by last Saturday , 28 November .
According to vaňka , the company decided to change the way to motivate their employees with extra work offered .
Employees can collect bonus the overtime or can take a day off on 28 December , i.e. prolong in one day Christmas festivities vaněk mentioned .
In addition , all employees shifts on Saturday will receive money for travel and for food .

A Czech discovery : a substance effective until the HIV virus ' encallecidos '
The team of scientists Czechs and Germans is evidence of new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the Agency
The main advantage of this substance enhanced is the fact that it is also effective against viruses resistant to medicines .
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound not as effective in a strategy of the virus , as some medicines already accessible .
The disease AIDS cannot be cured until now .
However , the lives of patients may be extended significantly , thanks to a mixture of medicines impeding replication of the HIV virus in the body .
However , its use has many side-effects .
If replication of the virus does not completely deleted , will create the so-called resistant viruses ; against them , no longer operate medicines .
The work of experts of three institutes of the Academy of Sciences from the Czech Republic , všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus .
Showed that substances metalocarboranos calls have effect on the albúmina , responsible for the spread of the HIV virus .
The metalocarboranos compounds are boron , hydrogen , carbon and cobalt .
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently to all medicinal products used today , and therefore can solve the problem of resistance .
In his work scientists would find new , ‘ improvement ’ compounds , prepared knowing the molecular mechanism of its link to the albúmina of the virus .
The metalocarboranos have one three-dimensional structure : two cages poliedros composed of atoms of boron , hydrogen and carbon are united by the atom of metal , in this case by cobalt .
A virus traitor and resilient
The proteasis HIV is a albúmina the HIV virus , and it is essential to the life cycle of the virus .
Without the proteasis of HIV , there is the fragmentation of the HIV virus and does not create mature infectious and corpúsculos of the virus .
If we stop the proteasis HIV , stop the spread of the virus into the body of the patient , explain scientists in a press report published by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry in the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic .
In an article published in the scientific journal Journal of medicinal chemistry scientists described a number of compounds , in which two pairs of cages ( see table ) are united by a short number , which remains systematically amended .
A little weaker , but more effective
Proof of the impact of this series of substances against the proteasis HIV was conducted in test-tube , and also against variants resistant , obtained of patients with HIV .
The effect of the common metalocarboranos variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in medicines used clinically , however do not lose their effect on variants resistant , where medicines often do not work .
The mechanism of the single effect , its other qualities as biological and chemical stability , lower toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications do , that the metalocarboranos are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective medicines against HIV , said pavlína řezáčová , the chief of the structural Biology Laboratory in the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and molecular genetica 's Institute in the academía of science .
Heat for budget . ODS attacked Fischer , he defends
The head of ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget approved for next year is " appalling ' and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should , according to him , think its future existence .
The statements of ODS were identified by the Prime Minister and judgments strong .
They say it is time for the analysis .
The vice-chairman of ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet , with the support of čssd ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works .
According to Nečas Prime Minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies wants to rely on the minority , which seeks to combat the growing shortage , or if you want to remain in place with the help of the parliamentary left .
The attitude of ODS and the social democración towards the problem of public deficit is completely different , warned Nečas .
The House of Deputies yesterday approved the budget for 2010 , however with the proposals for amendment by the left , by more than 12 billion Crowns .
The House of Deputies increased the money for salaries of state officials , for social services and direct payments to farmers .
The government he reproached the proposals of ODS , since cubiertamente increase the budget deficit .
The Czech Republic should govern with the deficit of 163 billion Crowns .
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the desire of the government , that the amended budget is better than a provisional budget .
Disillusionment and futility
The Minister of Finance , Eduard janota , spoke of disillusionment and the sense of hopelessness ; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government would assess the current situation .
Nečas is convinced that if janota seriously threaten with the resignation in case of adoption of the proposals modificadoras , the situation could have been different .
According to televize Česká janota called a meeting with the Prime Minister .
Pointed out , which is planning to stay in the job .
The reason is his disappointment on the budget negotiations .
If Fischer agrees with another struggle against the budget deficit , as Nečas in government have nothing to do the nominated by the čssd , which imposed changes in the budget .
The Prime Minister also should say clearly , if you will resign , if the House adopt other laws that increase the deficit , for example those relating to subsidies in disease , income , or to amendment of the law of service .
Ministers Topolánek : nominated by the ODS are not to blame
Is the matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government .
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not done anything wrong , stressed Topolánek in the news text .
Recalled , which in several ministries in positions of lieutenants there are people who belong to the top 09 , who voted against the budget .
Nečas stressed , that if you Fischer decides to resign ourselves to the principle of the struggle with the height of the deficit in the public finances , " is absolutely logical and correct , relying on the left-wing majority , which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies ' .
However it cannot count on the support and tolerance of members of ODS .
I have not thought about that , when the time comes , I will deal with this , told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Defence Minister Martin barták , which was appointed to the government precisely by members of ODS .
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon went to a European Council meeting in Brussels .
ODS gave at the request of the Prime Minister
Nečas stressed , that ODS on Wednesday , in the Chamber of Deputies probably would vote against the amended budget , if the Prime Minister does not explicitly request to members of ODS to acceptance of the budget .
We are not as orphans , we are not small children , reacted to the question , if ODS does not care about the absence of the head of the party in Parliament and in the Czech Republic , during the negotiations on the budget .
I realise that my vote would be weakened .
To resign from the mandate he knew , that in the following months were particularly bolchevización of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of everything positive , reacted Topolánek itself .
According to the new timetable čd trains will be fewer trains by almost the same charges
Dráhy České ( railways Czechs ) since 13 December cancelled or restringuirán some rapid and local trains lesser used and , on the contrary , reinforce some links .
The total length of trafficking will be reduced by 2 % in comparison with today , after the new timetable of trains enters into force .
The majority of charges including the basic price and customer will not change .
More chances of links to the capital will gain for example the inhabitants of the region of ostravsko dráhy , for this line will add unacarretería pendolino .
The direct train , on the contrary , it will move to Bratislava .
In line Prague - pisek - České budějovice fast , there will be fewer trains restringuirán direct links Prague - letohrad .
In the regions , the largest transport reduction planned by dráhy is in the region of Hradec Králové , eight per cent in total , on the contrary , transport will increase in Prague and the surrounding area .
Two trains also be cancelled at night in the Prague - tábor budějovice České - and some rapid trains in line Prague - pisek - České budějovice be reduced just a few days of the week .
One of the greatest changes is the introduction of a new hotline of milovice to Prague , the inhabitants of milovice must change in Lysá nad Labem .
This is the line of the system 15. Esko , around the cities , its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line of Lysá nad Labem to milovice .
Links to long distances to the capital will end in the station Prague hlavní nádraží .
Čd will introduce more links na pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to šumperk / jeseník move every two hours .
As of 13 December travellers will not travel to Bratislava in pendolino .
The account by the regional railway this year : 200 million more than before
Rapid trains are responsible and paid by the Ministry of Transport , to cover the so-called dráhy demonstrable losses will be next year four thousand million kroner in total , like this year . The local trains are responsible for regions , next year will pay eight thousand million kroner in total , and the state will help them almost three billion .
This year regional trains are 200 million more expensive .
For local and dráhy fast trains have a new contract of ten years , until now the contract was always a year .
Dráhy are happy with the system , and perhaps that is why did not increase the price of a large majority of the tickets .
The changes occur only in the banknotes of one day - čd net and cheap Internet eliška tickets .
Without a card for travellers customer the price čd net increase of 450 to SEK 600 000 .
The price of eliška will depend on the distance , hitherto , the price only 160 kroner in order to travel between any two regional towns .

It is Michal Hašek of the region jihomoravský kraj , Radko martínek of pardubický kraj and hetmán of olomoucký kraj Martin tesařík .
Jančura mentioned this in twenty minutes in radiožurnál .

All regions however ended signing contracts to the long-term dráhy České .
Every three hetmánes are attacking us and they talk about the fact that we are taking raisins " of the pie " , however we brought only supply for what they wanted .
They claim that we are more expensive than České dráhy , which is not true and dráhy České prices , which were set last week .
So we have nothing else to defend ourselves .
It is by slander towards society student agency , said to radiožurnál jančura .
He mentioned at the same time have evidence of all regions . According to him have not taken steps in line with European law .

The neumococal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The vaccine neumococal from January onwards will put an end to the usual custom .
As a first vaccine must be free for families and at the same time voluntary .
However they are already views , that the compulsory vaccine would be more effective .
The preparations for the introduction of the free neumococos culminate vaccine .
The Institute of medicines is already setting the maximum prices of vaccines , be covered by insurance companies .
The experts also already have this clear in the procedure of vaccination .
The new vaccine
Free vaccinations to children born in August
Since January vaccine can receive a free neumococal children born since 2 August last year .
The condition is not having received neither a dose of vaccine before .
The who began with the vaccine last year or earlier , have to cover other dose of the vaccine also .
The first doses of vaccine has to be received between the third and fifth month old child .
Last year a quarter of families left voluntarily vaccinate their children against neumococos .
Parents however paid by a dose 1600 kroner and more .
To vaccinate younger children it takes four dose .
Usually experts estimate that insurance companies spend in vaccines 300 to 450 000 000 annually .
However make treatment , which is needed for children do not vaccinated .
So far the State spent throughout the vaccination of children approximately 500 000 annually .
Vaccination deck was initiated by the so-called janota package .
The pneumococcus is the cause of the otitis average but also serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning .
Neumococales infections in our country die each year according to the investigations in hospitals 28 children not exceeding 10 years of age .
In addition to the Czechia deck neumócocal vaccine in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries .
Will it be compulsory the vaccine ?
However , at the same time appear views , which this vaccine could be mandatory in future .
Since January should be covered by insurance companies and voluntary .
The compulsory vaccine would be better , noted for example Rudolf kalovský , the head of the civic association nahlas .
Its partnership spreads vaccines neumococales long-standing .
The experts in an international conference , in which our partnership participated , were not completely satisfechoscon the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine .
It is not absolutely ideal .
On the other hand we are happy to achieve at least this .
I believe that this is the path that we now have to undertake , kalovský mentioned .
The Ministry of Health but it does not want to change the procedure for vaccination against neumococos .
At the moment I do not feel at all , stated its spokesperson vlastimil sršeň .
The voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages , assert doctors
The President of the League of paediatricians odborná společnost praktických dětských lékařů Hana cabrnochová recognizes , that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages .
If all children receive the vaccine , we can think about reducing the number of the dose . " in the situation , when the vaccine costs an amount so high , relatively we understand the political decision to initiating vaccination and voluntary , " said cabrnochová .
The experts hope , that from next year more than 80 percentage of young parents left vaccinate against neumococos their babies .
The neumococal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by the companies health , not by the state .
Insurance companies should spend more money in prevention , in order to save then in treatment , explains cabrnochová .
Doctors will have to buy vaccines for themselves .
However paediatricians are worried about the purchase of vaccines .
Previously , vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and spread to doctors , just as when the State gives them other vaccines .
Some Members however were afraid , that insurance companies could " take money of health insurance . "
Doctors so will have to buy vaccines and wait until they are paid by insurance companies .
It is estimated that paediatricians invest in vaccines 40 000 per month , which is a remarkable sum .
It will not be made any easier , said cabrnochová .

Can the Islam be French ?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state .
At a time when the Swiss voters have sought to prohibit the construction of minarets and where there is a widespread warning on the alleged Islamisation of Europe , John bowen , an American academic , has written a detailed report and studied on the possible integration of Muslims ( which in reality are being integrated ) in a secular societies more openly of the continent .
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of past work of the author “ why the French do not love headscarves ' ( ' why the French don ' t like headcarves " ) ( 2006 ) , a study elegant and in detail argued a problem which divided and concern about the country for a decade and a half , and whose effects are today still receive .
The latest book by Mr bowen has a broader perspective and more ambitious .
As good an anthropologist , wants to know not only are saying what politicians and the media about Islam in France , but what is actually happening .
Happened months mosques , schools and colleges which now provided to the 5-6 billion Muslims France what Mr bowen named Islamic spaces . "
He is a good viewers which reproduces discussions between teachers and students on the questions that more interest them .
Should a Muslim marriage in a mosque or in a city ( or both ) ?
Should they teach young Muslims on the evolution and the rights of homosexuals ?
Can a Muslim woman marries a man non-Muslim ?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim use a banking system based on interests to get a mortgage ?
These issues are apparently worldly , he argues , things in everyday life , which concern the means more than the political drama .
The author identifies a new generation of imams , teachers and intellectual renowned , none of them , with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan , an academic and scholar Arab Muslim born in Switzerland .
This new generation trying to open the debate on how to be at the same time a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society .
They fail to disseminate this argument completely .
The Conservatives are hesitating just the idea of a French or European Islam .
The thinkers and activists that Mr bowen interview tend to disagree with their counterparts in Salafi purist , supporters of Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia , who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe .
Bowen thinks that the values Muslims and secularism French could be compatible .
But adaptation requires mutual concessions .
Questioned how French policymakers ( and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends secularism ) are genuinely committed to pluralism .
Suggests that Muslims have probably more unfair treatment that Catholics , Protestants and Jews , who also have had to its historical commitments with secular republicanism .
More than a growing pragmatism , perceived “ an adjustment of values ' .
Can the Islam be French ? after reading this book , one is inclined to say yes , but not yet . "
The most devastating situation of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatic than any other habitat of the planet .
That defines the ice is melting at an alarming rate , taking with life that cannot survive elsewhere .
The interests of oil , gas , transport and fisheries have focused in waters newly opened with diplomats , lawyers and now authors , as a result of this .
In " on thin ice ' ( ' on thin ice ' ) Richard Ellis , a writer and enlightening depicts a natural history from northern icon , the polar bear .

Ironically , it is in the waters northward of those two nations chasing where the ice will last for more time .
In his new book , ' after the ice ' ( ' after the ice ' ) , alun Anderson , a former editor of new scientist , offers a story made chillingly clear on the science of the Arctic and a daunting gaze of how one can transform the future of that place .
It is not that scientists have all the answers .
Atmospheric nor scientists nor the oceanographers have properly can explain the speed of change .
It is not for lack of commitment .

Cuban officers arrested a contractor American government
The Cuban Government has arrested a contractor American government mobile distributions and laptop computers in the country , stated on Saturday at the State Department .
The contractor , which has not yet been identified , works to development alternatives Inc , based in bethesda .
The company does in projects for clients as the International Development Agency of the United States and the World Bank .
The consular officials together with the US interests section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee , who was arrested on 5 December .
The specific positions have not been made public , although under Cuban law , a Cuban citizen or a visitor alien can be detained for almost anything deemed " dangerous " .
All activities so-called counter-revolutionary , which include minor protests and critical letters , involve the risk of arrest .
The graffiti anti government and speeches are considered serious offences .
Cuba has an incipient blogger community , led by the popular commentator yoani Sánchez , who often writes on as she and her husband are followed and harassed by government officials .
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prizes , but the permission has been denied .
The arrest of an American contractor probably can cause tensions between the Communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration , which has been looking for a rapprochement " at a slow pace ' to improve relations with the island .
The New York Times was the first to publicize news of the arrest on Friday night .
The new American policy stresses that if the Cuban Government takes specific measures , such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for the opposition , there will be reciprocity of part of the United States .
Mobile phones and laptop computers is legal in Cuba , even if they are new products and seized upon in a country where the average salary of a worker in government is $ 15 per month .
The Cuban Government granted ordinary citizens the right of mobile buy only this year ; are used primarily for text messages , since a telephone conversation of 15 minutes would cost the daily wage .
The use of the Internet is extremely limited in the island .
It is available in expensive hotels and for overseas visitors in the hotel , and at some establishment of government , such as universities .
Cubans who want to connect , often have to give their names to the government .
Access to many websites is restricted .
The arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual .
Berbena glory , press officer in the US interests section in Havana , said that most of the handful of American citizens imprisoned in Cuba is behind bars for crimes such as trafficking in drugs .
Berbena said that he cannot provide more information on the arrest .
The arrest and detention are clearly irrelevant .
An activity that in any open society would be legal , as mobile distributed free of charge , in Cuba is a crime , said José Miguel vivanco , Director of the programme of the Americas of Human Rights Watch , which recently published a weighty report on freedoms in Cuba , so-called ' new Castro , same Cuba ' , a reference to the location of Raúl Castro as leader of the country , to replace its sickening older brother Fidel .
Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested , tried and imprisoned in a day .
Stated that any solution would probably be policy , and that the Cuban Government often leads to a negative reaction in the United States , just when the two countries are beginning to have more dialogue .
Desenmarañan Pakistani officials a plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday the Pakistani authorities the alleged brain rendered harmless a plot to send five men of Virginia northern Afghanistan to kill US troops , saying that they expect the case can help unravelling an extensive network of Internet terrorist recruiters , which moves in search of young radicalized .
Researchers said they were chasing the mysterious insurgent figure , known as saifullah , who had invited men to Pakistan then discovered that one of them commented approving terrorist attacks on the internet videos YouTube .
Saifullah led to men once were in Pakistan , trying to help them achieve the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan , which is a family place for al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps .
But a Pakistani intelligence officer who had been informed about the case , stated on Saturday that saifullah was unable to convince the commanders of Al Qaeda that men were not part of a plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network .
It is therefore the isolated for several days in the eastern town of sargodha , far from the towering Northwest mountains , which have become a terrorist haven .
They are considered as part of a covert operation .
For this reason were rejected , stated the officer , who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the case .
The official said that men do not inmutaron and even were trying to achieve proper adoption for access to the fields of Al Qaeda , when the police authorities Pakistanis operatives .
The case of the five men , who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI , underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and , perhaps more importantly , determine who cannot be trusted .
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 , the American intelligence has made a top priority to infiltrate persons within Al-Qaeda .
Recruiters of the organization acted as guards , not leaving move those who do not show a serious commitment of holy war , and those who might be spies .
Analysts said that Al Qaeda analyses with special attention to conscripts Americans aspirants .
But for the organization represents a huge attraction , due to their potential for accessing American objectives and because of their value of propaganda .
But kohlmann Evan analyst , senior to the nefa foundation based in the United States , said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to those who admits , because the American intelligence agencies have become experts in their methods of recruitment .
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups , what better way to follow the model of recruitment which so many have already followed ? kohlmann expressed .
It has become a model that is based much more on the web .
Tens of thousands are protesting in Copenhagen , require climate " action "
On Saturday , tens of thousands of demonstrators marched here by the streets demanding the negotiators working in the exhibition centre beautiful city center , bolder actions for the climate .
The demonstrators said that 100,000 people participated in the event , but the police found that the amount was closer to 25,000 .
The event was relatively peacefully , but a handful of activists masked placed explosive small near a group of government buildings in the city centre .
In a day in which little befell the climate talks sponsored by the UN , thousands of activists have walked the city arguing banners in English saying ' no ' and a planet B in English stating , " the land says ' enough is enough ' .
Several famous joined to protest , including the Danish model and fotógrafa Helena Christensen , who said that travel Peru , the birthplace of his mother , made me aware of the issues distressing with which the country must deal due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening . "
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration , to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world , to present a fair agreement , ambitious and binding , expressed .
This is not an easy task , but it has to be done , there is no way of avoiding it any longer .
The police prevented the demonstrators approach too the beautiful center , and said that they had arrested 19 people , mainly due to the use of masks or by carrying out of pocket knives .
According to the Danish law , those activities are prohibited during demonstrations .
According to a witness , which requested not to be identified by being involved in the talks on climate , some activists with masks sports and explosive several black dress placed near the main channel of Copenhagen , which is close to several ministries .
Were about buildings , said , adding that began as flashes , but who were followed by " a couple of large explosions . "
Inside the Convention centre , people met some television screens to look the way throughout the afternoon .
But the protest there did not seem to penetrate the conscience of key officials as its Wei , negotiator at head of China on climate .
When asked if I thought that the demonstration was taking a constructive impact in international discussions , replied in English , " not really was aware of the situation ' .
Then went on to say in Mandarin , " as the place of meeting is large , I cannot hear what is happening outside . "
Noted that depended on the prospect of each define if progress was being harmful or beneficial .
He said that this reflects the attention of the general public and of different sectors to the issue of climate change .
On the other hand , ' one could also say that affect negotiations , or freedom of other people .
The data of a test revealing racial differences persistent
The federal card qualification last week on the performance in mathematics , was a very good news for public schools of district capital .
Although the district is still far from systems with better performance , the report card showed that pupils of 4 and 8 degree gave to a more rapid pace strides over the past two years , with regard to the cities of Atlanta , Chicago and New York .
But what remains engraved on the recent figures of the evaluation of the national educational progress is the persistent differences in performance between African American students and students White , both locally and nationally .
The average scores of white of fourth degree of D.C. during the past two years , rose from EUR 262 to 270 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but their peers African-Americans increased just three points , 209 to 212 .
In reality the difference of output grew between 2007 and 2009 , 53 to 58 points .
The progress of African-Americans the eighth degree remained essentially fixed , falling insignificant a statistically , 245 .
The average scores of Whites were not included in the results of proof , because the sample size was not quite large .
Over an extension of six years , the picture is not more encouraging .
The difference between white and black of fourth degree in 2003 , when it issued the first enpe in the district , was 60 points of the scale ( 262 to 202 ) .
Although the results achieved by children in both groups have risen during this period , the difference was barely reduced to 58 .
Some lawyers of education in the district expressed concern last week , since progress held by the rector Michelle A. the rhee and the mayor Adrian M. fenty ( Democrat ) , were driven largely white by students , which are already very good students .
This would suggest that we have improved the whole in response to those at the top of the scale , which is problematic and controversial , expressed Jeff Smith , Executive Director of D.C. voice , a nonprofit calling for educational equality in the district .
I am not giving leaps of joy over a difference of two or three points , said the Council member of the D.C. , Kwame R. Brown ( dem.-por accumulation ) , who has a daughter in the fourth degree of the Eaton elementary .
Brown , an avid critical lifestyle rhee administration , said that the message of the results of the proof is that secondary schools of the city are in dire need attention .
Clearly always want to see the positive signs , and I respect that .
But the concern is that we are not looking neither the time nor the energy requirements of our high schools .
Rhee said that the district needs continue to find better ways of addressing the needs of students underperformers .
This autumn , for example , is training to some teachers to use a new curriculum of reading , the system of reading Wilson , addressed to students from the higher grades of primary school and media , not dominated the foundations of early reading in their schooling and are considerably behind their peers .
The mathematics of every day , a curriculum of mathematics from kindergarten until six , which emphasizes games and experiences of real life , which was introduced in the district under former superintendent clifford janey , which it does something of progress informed by the enpe last week .
But I think that we must continue to work to offer the best possible interventions to those students who are below the level of degree , expressed rhee .
Others say that the results of the enpe highlighted the issue of whether rhee can further increase the overall performance of the system and yet provide extra money and resources for schools , that will be necessary to reduce the difference .
Here there is a sort of dilemma lurid to Michelle rhee , said Bruce fuller , a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley , studying scores urban evidence .
The solution mainstream politics is to concentrate its resources and reforms of administration to schools located in poorer sections of D.C.
Then the objective can generate political implications that go against the important timetable .
But the problem , of course , is that , like other urban superintendents , it is clinging to the middle class white and black .
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of excellent schools .
We must strengthen our neighbourhood schools , so that all families , regardless of where they live , have confidence in that their children can access an excellent public education .
Janey , now superintendent of schools of Newark , said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the difference of return is extending the traditional public school year , currently 180 days in the district , to compete with independent schools .
We must reach nearly 200 days to have the strength of change , said janey , which came to an agreement with the Union of their teachers last year in a year of 185 days , seeing it as a " indicator " to seek a greater increase in the next Convention .
Make higher education part of more future
The tourist bus came to the University of gettysburg with strong are exhausted .
Graciela Rodríguez , 12 years , blinked fell and for a moment to the White columns , brick walls and emerald pasture land .
Parents of graciela had been scarcely graduated in a secondary school of El Salvador .
Until recently , graciela itself , which was born in silver spring and live in riverdale , had never set foot in a university campus .
Even so , when it and other pupils eighth grade of the Group gettysburg explored , where enrolment costs 38.690 dollars a year , its attitude was less of guests impressed that the potential of enthusiastic students .
Yes ! here is where I am ! exclaimed graciela , who would like to study medicine , when the guide announced that had entered in the building of science .
My goodness me , may seriously ? , pensativamente said , when the guide spoke of the low proportion profesor-estudiantes of school .
The University of Pennsylvania was the 7th that children have visited in his trip three days , and had already absorbed deliberate completely message : the question is not whether you are going to go to university .
The question is to what .
Although there is growing concern about the large number of children born in America of immigrants Hispanics who leave secondary schools or teenage pregnancy , there are also hundreds of thousands who enter the university education they need to access the middle class .
Indeed , one in five of these Hispanics " second-generation completes " at the University , a remarkable achievement since many of their immigrant parents , especially Mexicans and Central America , entered into the United States without leaving secondary school .
Its success stories are important , they assert researchers , because they reveal the way forward to a generation that will play a key role in the country 's workforce .
Those who look to the improved performance say that often have a natural affinity for school and innate a tendency to succeed .
Many also have parents who set high targets for their children and find ways of compensating for their lack of familiarity with schools Americans .
But the tutorials can also play a unique role in helping graciela and millions of children as it to arrive at the university , in particular if efforts are argue over time .
Noting to low-income children whose parents have no experience and skills to help them surf the system , it follows that any intervention at any time will not solve it and said Patricia gándara , a researcher of the University of California , Davis , who has examined to students Latino .
We must think about providing a network of support for these children , from kindergarten to secondary school .
The federal programme which funded the tour of the universities of graciela is a useful example .
Known as gear up , provides more than $ 300 million per year to local school systems , to implement programmes of preparation university which start when students are low-income in middle school and continues to finish secondary school .

The Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns by violence and political instability , the Iraqi Government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure , for two sales which concluded on Saturday .
The 10 agreements the Ministry of Iraqi oil reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China , Russia and the European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring the oil in Iraq , mutilated by decades of war and sanctions .
American companies grew fainter having pujado in only two of the 10 auctioned deposits .
Seven US companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began on Friday .
The only presented an offer lost .
Two US companies agreements for auctioned deposits in June .
The poor representation of the American oil giants in the opening of the oil industry of Iraq was surprised to analysts .
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of US companies , Asian and European there are in the lead , said ruba husari , editor of the forum of oil from Iraq , an online news centre .
It will be a long time before something more is in supply in Iraq .
Security concerns , aggravated by bombing massive coordinated on Tuesday , and political instability while the American military withdrew , probably prevented the American oil companies risk more strongly in Iraq , which is the third largest source of oil in the world , claimed analysts .
American companies were in some cases at a disadvantage , because the rivals , particularly Chinese and other energy companies controlled by the government , have significantly lower labour costs and are more prone to take risks because they are accountable to shareholders .
Exxonmobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc were the only American companies agreed with the Ministry .
The main signatures Americans , as Chevron and conocophillips , who have tightened ties with the Ministry of Iraqi oil and have provided technical advice in recent years , walked away empty-handed .
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two contracts awarded this weekend .
The National Petroleum Corporation , owned by the Chinese state , ofertó in more contracts than any other company and achieved great investment in contracts for two main reservoir .
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic power and technological , expressed the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil Assam Jihad .
We are confident that the company China will be on a par with their competitors , and will fulfil its commitments towards Iraq .
Shortlisted companies to submit proposals made offers that will then be balanced with the funding per barrel that the Ministry was willing to pay to increase production above current levels in each reservoir .
The main planner of Al-Qaeda has been , apparently , murdered in Pakistan
It is believed that a so-called American missile attack on the border of Pakistan with Afghanistan has killed a main planner of operations of Al Qaeda this week , said on Friday , the officials of counter-terrorism Americans .
If confirmed , this would be the second deadly attack against a high-ranking terrorist leader this autumn .
Al-somalí Saleh was one of the two Arab men are thought to have died on Tuesday , when a couple of missiles shook against his car , near the town of look Shah province North Waziristan , according to American sources Pakistani and officials of the region .
Local authorities stated that missiles were launched by a type of unidentified aircraft operated by the CIA within the illegal tribal area of Pakistan .
They were driving a car target , in the direction of the Afghan border , where the car was struck , said an official of the civilian intelligence agency of Pakistan , speaking telephone , from look Shah .
The official said that local militants suspected piled on the scene and rapidly confiscated what became of the " bodies completely wrecked . "
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims , but two officials of counter-terrorism Americans cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead .
Described to Somali as a high-ranking military planner al-Qa 'ida , who led the operations of the terrorist group outside the region of afganistán-pakistán .
Was devoted to conspire worldwide , said a senior official , who spoke anonymously , citing the delicate nature of the American air strikes within the Pakistani territory .
Considering its central role , this probably included conspirativos attacks against the United States and Europe .
Had a strategic guide senior command of Al Qaeda and translated into operational patterns potential for terrorist attacks .
The second official American said that Somali had risen rapidly in the ranks of Al Qaeda and was well connected with other extremist groups in the region .
It may not be a name known for some Americans , but that does not diminish in any way the threat that we raised with us and our allies , stated the second official .
If confirmed his death , Somali would be the second leader of Al-Qaeda and Taliban leader murdered since September , when a similar attack killed najmuddin jalolov , the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area , and other three high-ranking officers .
The pace of attacks pilotados aircraft led by the CIA has declined since the summer , from an average of approximately six operations per month to two , according to an account of the long war journal , a website led by a non-profit organization .
The decline can be blamed on a tactic improved by terrorist groups , who have taken steps to limit its vulnerability while informant mercilessly murder suspected , stated the site .
The maximum UN envoy in Kabul almost decided
The maximum UN envoy in Afghanistan , Kai Eide , said on Friday , that would give up his post in March , ending with a tumultuous mandate that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the presidential election of Afghanistan UN-backed .
The departure of Eide happens when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan .
The UN envoy said that supports the increase , but is concerned that the American timetable for the military withdrawal which begins in 18 months sends other governments from NATO to withdraw its forces .
We need to accelerate the development of Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghan people so that they can rely on the international community , noted Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul .
The compromise must be long-term .
The Norwegian diplomatic also pushed to the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants , to cooperate with the political transition of Afghanistan .
The increase in the military sector must be reflected in the civil sector , stated .
He said that he was not in time by resigning , but simply serving a promise that he made his family in March 2008 , to move only two years in Kabul .
He said that wanted to notify the Secretary
The UN General Ban Ki-moon , so have the time to find a replacement .
What I have said is that it is better to start looking for a successor , expressed Eide .
When I arrived here , had a two-month gap between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
Ban has begun to seek a replacement , according to UN officials .
The officials say that have been considering Staffan di Mistura , a citizen sueco-italiano recently addressed to the UN mission in Baghdad , and Jean-Marie Guehenno , a Frenchman who previously led UN peace missions .
The position of Eide in Afghanistan tested before its former representative , Peter W. Galbraith , accusing him in September favour the President Hamid Karzai at the presidential vote of the country and cover evidence of a massive electoral fraud .
Eide denied charges , but said that accusations of Galbraith , who was sacked , " certainly upset the mission , because there were already much scepticism regarding the international interference in the election .
Eide said that proposed the appointment of a high representative civil to coordinate aid efforts by the forces led by the United States in Afghanistan .
Also boosted the leadership of the UN to allow his successor hire more staff of the United States and other Western countries , provided to the Afghan mission , stating that this will increase their confidence that their money is being used properly .
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations of their powers in Afghanistan , arguing that recruitment cumbersome regulations of the UN undermine their ability to attract talents .
This is so that the rules of the UN enabled me to recruit only to one person since May , expressed .
That is disastrous and cannot continue .
Gates : Iran will face additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. gates , said on Friday that global powers will soon " significant " additional sanctions against Iran , by their failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions .
Gates , involving a group of approximately 300 American troops in northern Iraq , during a journey from one week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq , I belittled the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic .
There are no good options in Iran , argued , in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such an event .
One of the things that worries me is that , if we have learned anything from Iraq during the past six years , is the inherent unpredictability of war .
The Obama administration is considering a package of targeted sanctions against the military and political elite of Iran , but Gates pointed out that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian people in general .
Was that it would be necessary to " a package of incentives and disincentives , " " to persuade the Iranian Government that they would really be less safe nuclear arms ' , because " its people will suffer greatly " sanctions .
Last Friday , in a statement made by the spokesman for the White House , Robert gibbs , administration joined the European leaders to warn that Iran will face consequences " credible " if its nuclear programme does not fully respect the indications from the UN Security Council and its nuclear supervisory body , the International Atomic Energy Agency .
Iran insists that wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes .
In discussions in Geneva on 1 October , indicated that he would return to negotiate on the restriction of its nuclear programme and it would make a substantial part of its reservation of enriched uranium in exchange of fuel that is desperately needed for a medical research reactor .
The administration has pushed for this agreement , as a way to build confidence between the two sides and make time for negotiations .
But since then , Iran appears to have distanced themselves from the tentative agreements , in part , the experts , because the Iranian leadership is divided in connection with the possibility of engaging with the United States .
Frankly , I believe that the tightening of Iran and the international community on some proposals that actually accepted in early October , has joined the international community , including the Russians and the Chinese , in a way in which they have been in terms of significant additional sanctions against Iranians , expressed gates .
President Obama has set a target date of 31 December to Iran to respond to the proposals , before rethink other options , including continue with what the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Hillary Rodham Clinton , once called " sanctions devastating . "
In a statement made in New York , the mission of Iran to the United Nations denounced what he called on Thursday ' unfounded accusations and have no legal basis , " on the part of some Members of the Security Council on Iran ’ s nuclear activities , and said that it is willing to continue with the talks with the United States and five other world powers , " in order to achieve an appropriate solution , in the long term . "
Gates , that he was going to return to Washington last Friday morning was found with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki , before fly to the Kurdish region of Iraq 's oil wealth , to meet with troops in Kirkuk and officials Kurds in Irbil .
Tensions are high among the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq , in particular with regard to borders , rights of ownership and partnership .
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for conflict , to avoid any delay in the projects of the United States , to reduce the number of American troops 115,000 50,000 towards the end of August .
Gates also sought to alleviate the Kurdish anxiety about lowering pending . American officials cited the words of gates to Massoud Barzani , the chairman of the regional government of Kurdistan : " We will preserve its security , prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq .
Not the drop . "
In an ageing China , a change of direction
Wang weijia and her husband grew surrounded by propaganda posters that the sermoneaban on the fact that ' mother earth is too tired to support more children ' and ' a baby MAS means a tomb more . "
Learned the lesson so well that , when government officials of Shanghai , alarmed by the low birth rate and ageing population of their city , changed tack suddenly this summer and began to provide incentives for young couples to have more than one child , your reaction was snapshot and strong : in any way .
We have already given all our time and energy only for a child .
There is nothing for a second , said Wang , 31 years , an administrator of human resources with a child of eight months .
More than 30 years after that included the one-child policy in China , creating two generations of children , children rechonchos notoriously spoilt only warmly , apodados emperors ' small ' , is an emerging demographic crisis in the country .
The average birth rate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple , compared with the six of when politics became effective division ,
The population in the UN , while the number of residents of 60 years and more harvesting of 16.7 % of the population in 2020 the 31.1 % towards 2050 . This is well above the global average of approximately 20 % .
The imbalance is worse in coastal cities very rich with populations well-educated , like Shanghai .
Last year , people aged 60 or more accounted for almost 22 % of the residents of Shanghai , while the birth rate was less of a child per couple .
Lingli Xie , Director of the Commission of family planning and municipal population of Shanghai , has said that infertile couples must have babies ' to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and mitigate future labour shortages . "
Shanghai is about to be " as old ( not so rich , however ) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden , " he said .
A gradual relief
Couched in the country 's constitution in 1978 , the one-child policy of China is perhaps the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party .
Couples who violate politics face huge fines , up to three times its annual salary in some areas , and discrimination in the workplace .
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for their contribution to preventing the critical pressure on their natural resources , while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in the imposition of politics .
In rural areas , some officials have obliged to pregnant women with a second child to undergo abortions .
In addition , many couples have made abortions according to the sex of the foetus , leading to a high innatural proportion varón-mujer .
In recent years , demographic officials have gradually softened its stance on the one-child policy .
In 2004 , enabled more exceptions to the rule , including urban residents , members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are children , and only in 2007 subdued many of its hard-line slogans .
Qiao xiaochun , a professor of the demographic research institute of the University of Beijing , he said that central government officials have recently been discussing even more radical changes , such as allowing couples have two children if one of the spouses is only child .
In July , Shanghai became the first Chinese city in launching an aggressive campaign to encourage more births .
Almost night the morning , posters ordering families have one child , were replaced by copies of regulations who detailing be suitable for having a second child and as a permit .
The city government sent to officials of family planning and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slipping brochures beneath the doors .
It has also promised to provide financial and emotional guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child .
Family planning officials say that the response has been very little overwhelming .
Disappointing answer
Although the officials from a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai argue that noted a moderate increase in requests for couples who want a second child following the launch of the campaign , more urban districts imply no change .
The municipality of huinan , with a population of 115,000 , for example , is still receiving only four to five requests per month .
The disappointed Shanghai officials say that , despite the campaign expected the number of births in the city in 2010 only scope around 165,000 , slightly higher than in 2009 , but less than 2008 .
Feng juying , chairman of the Committee 's family planning caolu municipality in Shanghai , said that financial considerations are probably the principal reason why many people do not want more children .
They want to give them the best to their first child stated .
Yang jiawei , 27 , and his wife , Liu juanjuan , 26 , said that they would love to have two children and are legally empowered to do so .
But as many Chinese , have only the inadequate medical and life insurance provided by the government .
Without a social safety net , they argue , this option would be irresponsible .
People in the West is incorrectly one-child policy as a matter of rights , said Yang , a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant seven months of the first child .
Yes , we are robbing the possibility of having more than one child .
But the problem is not only a political issue .
Is money .
Other couples psychological reasons cited for their doubts .
Wang , the administrator of human resources , said that he wants a single child because she was : ' We were at the centre of our families and we were used to be cared for all of us .
We are not accustomed to caring for others , and we do not really want to care for others . "
Chen zijian , 42 , the owner of an agency of translations , as explained in more firmly .
For parents with two careers , middle class , which reduce the birthrate , stated , this is about having enough success as to be selfish .
People aged between 20 and 30 grew seeing the fight their parents during the early days of the experiment of China with capitalism and do not want this kind of life for themselves , expressed .
Even one child time-consuming from parents , argued .
A mother must abandon at least two years of its social life .
Then there are issues of space , ' have to remodel your apartment , " and the strategic ' curriculum must be prepared for the better childcare centres , when the child is 9 months . "
The majority of his friends are ready to face this once , said Chen , but not two .
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living , expressed .
We do not want to make too many sacrifices .
A group of the UN outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference sponsored by the UN , characterized so far by offensive positions and mutual recriminations , captured renewed attention on Friday , with the dissemination of a document which provides for ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases during the next 40 years , with industrialized nations to carry on their shoulders the heaviest burden in the short term .
The text , which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward .
But was seen as an important step in a negotiation which is running out of time , with over 100 world leaders who will arrive in Copenhagen next week .
Produced by an ad hoc working group of the UN , the text does not talk about how much money would from rich to poor countries to tackle the global warming in the short and long term .
And this provides a range of options for the key questions , which include how developed economies and the main emerging economies recortarían its production of coal , and what would be the limit of the global increase in temperature that policymakers would be willing to tolerate .
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process , John coequyt , High Representative in Washington on Sierra club .
Michael Zammit cutajar who drafted document of six pages , summed up a text of negotiation of 180 pages to concentrate on what the maximum official UN climate , yvo de boers , described as " the great picture . "
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement , in which the industrialized nations recortarían collectively its emissions by 2020 between 25 and a 45 % compared with 1990 levels , while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 per cent .
Together , countries recortarían emissions between 50 and 95 % by 2050 .
The European Union also stimulated the talks on Friday , promising to provide $ 3.6 billion every year for the next three years , to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change , since floods and droughts to deforestation .
Anyway , this Friday , showed the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks last week .
The special climate envoy of United States , Todd Stern , rejected the assertions seeking compulsory cuts in greenhouse gas emissions in the industrialized countries , compared with volunteers from the main emerging economies , if they were not financed by the developed world .
The manoeuvre indicated that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China , with regard to what the Bush administration officials just two years ago .
The United States is not going to make an agreement without the major developing countries will move forward and take measures , expressed Stern , who also regretted that the text did not enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers .
Stern has commented one hour after the Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs , said that he yafei maximum climate negotiator of United States lacked " common sense , " or " was " very irresponsible for having said earlier in the week that the United States would not help China economically to deal with global warming .
With the future economic trajectory of the world 's major powers are at stake , the fault lines have erupted both within the developing world , as between the industrial world and emerging economies .
The current battle is both to save individual economies to save the planet , with China and the United States faces on their respective obligations , while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four countries of the world are ignoring the most influential scientific imperative to take action more courageous .
Ricardo ulate , a delegate from Costa Rica , said that it is not surprising that the major powers are arguing about who should pay the costs to limit greenhouse gases , even when vulnerable countries have become increasingly aggressive seeking to restrain the biggest producers responsible for their actions .
This is clearly a game which is developing a new economic hegemony , argued ulate , who also works as a regional councillor on climate change in Mexico and Central America , for international conservation .
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change indicated that they would continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the main participants say that talks will produce at most a political agreement .
The alliance of small island states , with 43 members , drew up a proposal of preliminary treaty of 24 sooner pages on Friday morning .
Artur runge-metzger , leading international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission , said that the thrust of the small island nations has blundered " political pressure on the entire political process , " in part because they are now consolidated and require the action of emerging economies such as China and India .
The talks made a new urgency while delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most exceptional issues before the Heads of Government will reach clinch a deal .
High-level officials , as the Minister for the environment jairam Indian ramesh and the Chinese Minister , fell from aeroplanes and ran into the corridors of beautiful center , meetings behind closed doors and press conferences , in order to be able to delimit the claims that particular attention during the next week .
The absolute disorder of the meeting ( where every day 13,000 people into and out of the centre of a Convention , the activists who are presented through the night entertainment juggling of countries that they are selling , and are preliminary proposals around instead of path mail ) , presents a challenge .
The intensity only built : almost all the key ministers are here at the moment , and on Wednesday , 60 Heads of Government will be in Copenhagen .
We are entering the older leagues , said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez , Vice-President for global international conservation policy .
The heavyweights are arriving .
The first train to 225 kmh of Great Britain redefines the sentiment of Monday
To those , on Monday morning , a perforará trial whistle darkness to point out an outflow of train that marks a revolution for travel in Great Britain .
The first high-speed InterCity train the country will reach 225 kmh , when come as a bolt from ashford , Kent , St panrcas Station in London , covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes .
Lord adonis , the Secretary of transport , it then join the lady Kelly Holmes , aboard the first javelin intercity service outside London .
He hopes that the new service connects finally to Britain to an international network of rapid trains , reliable and connects large conurbations of the Midlands , the North and Scotland to London .
The neglected remote areas would become prosperous suburbs , business travel times are acortarían and change of aircraft and cars would reduce emissions to rail national coal , as well as relieve congestion on the roads .
In theory , the three main political parties believe in this vision .
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national railway network , the battle inevitable planning and fears on environmental damage , can stop still high-speed lines of Great Britain .
High speed two ( hs2 ) , a company formed in January to provide the government a feasibility study , submit its report to Lord adonis on 30 December was , according to the times .
This will provide a detailed road map of the next phase planned for the high-speed network .
The new line between London to the West Midlands will be drawn up within a radius of five metres in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact can be controversial .
In rural areas , the plan chart within a radius of 25 metres a definitive route .
It is also hoped that hs2 establish three options for a broader high-speed network addressing the North .
Lord adonis will respond in the spring .
The option of choice that is being proposed is a configuration with form of , and in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands .
The line was split in or near Birmingham , with a branch that goes to the West since the peninos to Manchester and Scotland , and another to the north-east until Sheffield , Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne .
A single line would come to Scotland .
“ it seems that this option would be more beneficial , " said one Member of the railways .
Once completed , journey times between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 p.m. and 40 minutes .
The first tranche , which does not become operational by 2025 , would allow passengers travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with the little more than an hour today .
The proposals would ensure trains travel to kmh 402 , making the British network in quickest of Europe .
The initial path is designed to withstand trains 400 MT long , capable of carrying 1.1 people .
At least 18 trains could operate every hour in a line of londres-birmingham .
This means that there would be a London terminal able to receive 20,000 passengers per hour .
Considering the restrictions of space in the capital , is expected to extend existing station to conform to the high-speed network .
Railway industry experts argue that only the station St Mr. pancras international or euston offer that potential .
Lord adonis announced if it believes that the scheme should proceed , but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that there will not be a final decision until after a general election .
Even if it initiates the work , the network would have to build in sections .
Initially it would oblige trains to make swift lines by the existing Carriles North of Birmingham , maintaining journey times between London and Scotland above the three hours .
This is viewed as a crucial point needed to ensure a change of aircraft to trains , a reference point for the railway revolution .
Taxpayers are faced with the mortgage by a naranjal of £ 75,000 of a conservative
Alan Duncan , the spokesperson of the Conservative Party , I gained the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year on the cost of a naranjal that built in the home of their constituency .

The ground floor comprises a kitchen , living room and dining room , but the office of fees agreed with Mr Duncan needed more space .
Last year a greenhouse added to the House , described in levels as a " naranjal . "
The neighbours described it as " a greenhouse " for entertainment .
He was not requested to Mr Duncan make no reference to the increase of the loan , during a recent investigation by the committee on standards and privileges of the House of Commons on its previous mortgage agreements .

But on Friday evening , the office of the association UDF , controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not wish to be deprived of it , break the silence to launch a call on the Minister and to the Member intimándolos to renounce the acronym and to transfer the property rights of the mark , on pain of legal action .

It is an excellent news ( ... ) the assessment will show that he ( banier ) manipulated to this old lady , whom we must protect , stated .
Two years ago , the daughter of unique Lilian bettencourt criminal actions initiated against françois-marie banier , photographer and multifaceted artist for have been used for years the weakness of its mother to obtain EUR 1 billion in grants , through cheques , life insurance contracts or works of art .
For its part , bettencourt Lilian always denied having been manipulated by the photographer , whom it considers a long-standing friend .
On Friday , while the Court examined whether the action initiated by Mrs bettencourt-meyers , the allegations of lawyers were , on some occasions , a large family confession .
In this way , the lawyer bettencourt Lilian took into account three letters that his client send ( in 1999 , 2003 and 2005 ) to its notary in which said that little faith of the husband of Françoise bettencourt-meyers .
In the letter from the year 2003 , bettencourt Lilian added , according to counsel : " could explain to my daughter , he wrote to banier between one and two times a day for fifteen years .
Since its wedding , never again can once again speak with Françoise . "
For its part , the prosecution of Nanterre considered , once again , that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear , especially as a judge of wards refused , in recent days , to rise to your request for a procedure of judicial review her mother .
Bettencourt Lilian " has full capacity to face justice , is not under supervision and has no guardian .
Any other person may appear in its place , " said the representative of the public prosecutor , marie-chrsitine daubigney .
Finally , the Court decided that speak once made the verdict on the admissibility of Mrs bettencourt-meyers .
Does managerial revolution or end of the intelligence of businesses ?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies , our struggle for development of the intelligence of business will have been in vain …
More than ten years ago , the attitude of the direction of big business with regard to their employees recalls the position of companies with regard to consumers before the revolution of marketing : it is that the partners join " values " certain from above as before it was force consumers products designed by the technical plant .
Put the customer in the centre of the company , the revolution of marketing given its place at the strategies of the conquest of markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have no connection with factors of preference for customers is repeated regularly .
A demobilization of employees can end in a deadly demoralisation .
Suicides in France Telecom , PSA or Renault is just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives .
This demobilization uniquely serious development of all functions intellectuals of the company , especially R + D and , even more , of the intelligence of business .
Indeed , the Bi ( business intelligence ) ' demands that all parties involved ( ... ) have a proactive and conduct a forward-looking vision ' ; it needs by employees a compromise that is totally opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian direction .
For that reason , we convened a managerial revolution , which would be to partners in the heart of the concerns of the company like the customer .
Opinion polls have a relative utility internal
May opinion polls domestic , as the questionnaire done by orange between employees , will encourage the managerial revolution in practice ?
Unfortunately , I fear that it will not .
- in principle , because I was able to check that , faced with a new situation , and after many rounds , all companies end up doing essentially ... what always made b989 !
- secondly , because authoritarianism , one of the conditions of power , is growing in proportion to the importance of their own failures .
- because the majority of managers have a simplistic vision of human behavior .
As they come from the great schools of engineers , interpret the psychology of mechanistic manner .
Take comfort , intellectual , the former behavioral theory that the neurosciences " us " reactivated recently , and that the institutes of studies and the means widely disseminated behind their backs .
In this way , to suggest that it is possible to handle the " commandos " ( sic ) the commitment of executives , a recent investigation by ipsos published in Le figaro.fr reaffirms managers in a position of mechanistic management , itself unsuited to today 's world .
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilization
On the contrary , the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies , means taking a specific vision of human behavior .
Consists in integrating throughout reasoning or practice of corporate governance , a fundamental fact : for employees , the commitment to the company is possible only if it is clearly seen as a means to achieve part of their dreams , ambitions and projects .
Today , only studies from the analysis motifuncional taken this conception of the motivations of employees .
The studies showed that they therefore judge their company based on a doxa predetermined that allows them , through their image of the company , assess what it offers them to achieve their own projects of life .
Thanks to the identification and measuring the factors of mobilization , corporate leaders can control , anticipate and anticipate its " social performance " and relocate the management derecursos human " in the place . "
In this way , create an area which is favourable to the development of business intelligence organized a strong and effective .
Oslo speech : by " just war " Obama receives praise from the Right
This Friday , the American right-wing , satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 has defended the concept of " just war " against the enemies of United States , hailed the speech that Obama had spoken on Thursday .
The Conservatives , who had discredited the prize to Obama on 9 October , this time applauded the presidential speech , like Sarah Palin , former candidate for the vice-presidency during the elections in 2008 .
I loved what he said , declared Mrs Palin leading figure , the right wing of the Republican Party periodic the USA today , and added that it had addressed the question of war " sometimes necessary " in his memoirs recently published .
In my opinion , war is , of course , the last thing the Americans want to have to do , but it is necessary .
Terrorists must be stopped , noted .
Obama , which has inherited the two wars of your predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan , focused , this Thursday in Oslo , to justify the use of force , a way to explain their decision to send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan over nine days earlier .
Another adversary of Obama , Newt Gingrich , considered that the President had done a very good job " in Oslo .
I think that the speech was really very well , he was celebrating the former speaker of the House of Representatives , who appreciated in particular mention of ' the existence of evil in the world ' in the presidential words .
At times , the speech I found very historic Gingrich declared , during an interview in the radio programme " the takeaway . "
The former elected representative , which is regarded by some as a potential candidate for the Republican investiture for the presidential elections in 2012 , was pleased to hear a speaker " leftist " when reminded Members of the Nobel Committee " that they would not be free nor could bring a prize of peace if the recourse to force does not exist ' .
According to Michael gerson , author of speeches of George W. Bush and chronicler current in the Washington Post , Obama delivered a speech " American very . "
In addition to stand as " world citizen ' , as it always does , " " spoke as an American President ' to remind Europeans ' living in a bubble of security that they do not created and which do not do much to preserve it , " said gerson .
Among the few right not very convinced , a hawk Bush era , the former ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , described the discourse of " monotonous , patronising and lacks inspiration " in the website national review online .
To the left of the President , the representative Democrat Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama to justify recourse to force .
When we cover the war with the notion of justice , it is easy to justify the slaughter of innocents , warned .
However , the press centre left praised the President .
Los Angeles time , although still believes that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely , described his speech " over-production " especially for one speaker known for his talent .
The Oslo speech " should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict , poverty and oppression , " commented excited the newspaper Californian .
Obama " delivered a speech that was necessary ' , found the New York Times , juzgándolo " both bleak and enlightening . "
Road transport : three marathon negotiations to ensure the supply of Christmas
After three meetings of marathon negotiations , the trade unions in the sector of roads and the tlf ( transport and logistics of France ) , the only organisation employers who stayed until the end , arrived on Friday evening to an agreement which puts an end to the slogan of the strike or the threat which falls to the supply of Christmas .
During the meeting of signatures on Friday evening , the Secretary of State for Transport , Dominique Bussereau , " " was pleased by the agreement , after several negotiating sessions , which began on Wednesday morning .
After a second night of discussions , the negotiators they parted at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text agreed at the end of the morning .
Even though three management organisations ( fntr , unostra , otre ) were withdrawn by the door .
But a meeting of more than six hours which became the 11 H was necessary for all agree and the text is strong at 6.00 p.m.
The conflict ' would have been very damaging for companies ' and ' it was feared that disturbs the holiday seasons , " he declared Bussereau .
The text provides for an increase of 4 % lower wages ( in road transport local and regional ) , and 2.9 % for the highest ( international transport ) .
The tariff for time 8,72 raises 9,06 euros for low wages .
It is not much , but we started with great disadvantage , explained Patrice Clos ( Fo ) .
If so , I shall give the order to our militants that there was no more cuts or blockade in the centres of supply .
But can always be some dissenting rebel , added .
Philippe grillot , President of the tlf , acknowledged that it is ' a good agreement , " though was " difficult to concede increases in higher wages , bearing in mind the international competition . "
According to him , increases will be in the order of EUR 170 per month for low wages and 100 to EUR 120 to the highest .
It is an agreement with common sense and which respects the employees , stated maxime Dumont ( CFDT ) , while Thierry douine ( cftc ) found him as " an historic agreement ' .
For Richard jaubert ( CGT ) is ' an acceptable compromise ' .
The agreement provides for an increase in costs of displacement of 3 % and the holding of General Assemblies of road transport in the first half of 2010 , which will enable us to particularly address the subject of an extra payment and modernisation of the collective agreement .
Bussereau recalled that " a low of EUR 100 million in the burdens employers ' was the subject of an amendment of the government in the finance bill of rectification for 2009 , which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night .
The Government would seek the Senate to the vote " under the same terms ' .
The signing of tlf allows the agreement is implemented , firstly , to businesses adheridas this organization and , secondly , the entire profession , in case the Labour Minister make an extension .
There will be " as soon as " assured Bussereau .
The opposition of employers ' organisations could only delay the process .
The fntr complained that it was a " business naive , " because the EUR 100 million " had already been committed to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax ' .
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate an urgent situation , not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties , but not to oppose those who wish to eat Turkey in the next Christmas Eve dinner , regretted the unostra .
For the otre , the agreement puts at risk " stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months ' .
RER : conflicts over the weekend , unions outraged by the proposals of the RATP
The conflicts in the RER in line , the largest urban public transport of France , will continue over the weekend , because in the meeting on Friday , 2nd strike between unions and management of the RATP , there was no agreement and trade unions were dissatisfied with regard to their request for premium .
For this important weekend of Christmas shopping , on Saturday and Sunday circulating trains only between 10 H and the 20 H , a train of every two in the central section ( between la défense and nation ) and a train of every four in the other lines .
Interconnection with the snfc will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture that would require passengers to change train .
Galleries Lafayette , awaiting 200,000 customers every day , were happy ' the RATP strive to provide service to the large shops . "
The RER to crosses from West to East the city of Paris .
The tranche RATP travels from saint-germain-en-laye and Nanterre until boissy-saint-léger and marne-la-vallée .
This Friday , approximately one in every two trains circulated in the rush hours , and almost no train in hours Valley , as planned .
On Thursday , there was no disorder in the platforms will also be lengthened thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the island of France .
In this way , the ALBA , the saint-germain-en-laye ( Yvelines ) was much less crowded than normal , especially by the absence of students .
In boissy-saint-léger ( val-de-marne ) , Jack nbakina engineer , 29 , explained that had been lifted " an hour and a half earlier to reach schedule . "
The saint-lazare season is not saturó , indicated the SNCF , which had foreseen the supervision of police and security forces .
The RER in operating the SNCF from cergy-le-haut or destined for it arrived or departed from the station saint-lazare to join the metres .
New general assemblies striking workers will take place on Saturday and Sunday . Will assess the results , ' unsatisfactory ' according to the trade unions , a meeting which took place with the direction on Friday afternoon .
The Director of the RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all respects to the RER : working time , professional development , etc .
That is not what they want drivers who are demanding a premium due to them , as Thierry garon ( Sud ) .
The RATP puts even in parentheses its proposed premium , commented outraged the CGT , noting that the direction " was not able to resolve a problem which the SNCF and roads have already settled . "
It provides for a new meeting on Monday , " a longer analysis on the conditions for the exercise of the profession , " quantify the RATP .
What also led to the trade unions to say that the company " never imported users of the weekend . "
In the morning , some 150 drivers invaded a committee at headquarters in Paris .
Then the managers , who refused until then to dialogue during the strike , suggested the meeting ' to calm waters ' .
The conflict could spread to the RER B on Tuesday , after the unsa and the indépendants have submitted a notice .
The trade unions are calling for a premium of EUR 120 ( unsa ) to EUR 150 , of which EUR 30 are variable ( CGT , Fo , CFDT , Sud , indépendants ) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions in this line with 1 million passengers per day .
RER drivers , all in the second level of their careers , charge 2,200 to 2.7 gross and EUR 600 to EUR 650 premiums , for shorter working hours with alternating shifts , Sundays and public holidays .
The Turkish justice dissolved the prokurdo party , a far-reaching decision
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday , in favour of the dissolution of the main party prokurdo of the country , a decision that immediately caused anger in the Kurdish community , in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul .
This decision could complicate much the task of the government , which has just extend a hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict .
The Democratic Society Party ( DTP ) was dissolved because he became the " hotbed of activities jeopardizing the independence of the state and its unity indivisible ' , told the press the President of the Court , Hasim kiliç , after four days of deliberations .
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous , although it is only needed a majority of seven votes for the dissolution , indicated kiliç , and added that 37 of the party leaders , including its President Ahmet Türk and Mrs aysel tugluk , shut out of political life for five years .
Similarly , the judge announced the cessation of parliamentary immunity which benefited Türk and tugluk , and the confiscation of the property of the party by the Treasury .
The DTP account with 21 seats in Parliament ( 550 ) .
Their leaders warned before the verdict that Members leave Parliament before being parliamentarians without partisan label .
The decision follows a procedure which launched the Prosecutor of the Supreme Court , Abdurrahman yalçinkaya , in 2007 , which accuses the DTP to obey the ' principles ' of the Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) , considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and many more .
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political show-case of rebels of the PKK .
However , the party claims to have ' organic ' links with the PKK , but refuses to qualify as a terrorist organisation , and we call on the government to negotiate with him .
The verdict of the Court intervenes at the time the government he offers a hand to the Kurdish community , proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights , to ensure that Kurds stop supporting the PKK and thereby put an end to the conflict .
The leaders of the DTP argued that a dissolution could generate a resurgence of tension in the south-east anatolio , where a large number of demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK leader , Abdullah Öcalan , degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks .
Since the announcement of justice , thousands of demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP in Diyarbakir , the large city of south-east populated mostly by Kurds .
The forces of law and order threw tear-gas grenades and used water cannons , while the demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or stones with deep .
In Istanbul , also focused approximately one hundred people .
Following the verdict , Türk stated that the decision of the justice would ' deepening despondency . "
Turkey cannot resolve this issue ( Kurd , ndlr ) dissolving one party , told the press .
The government , formed by a party from Islamist movement , also regrets the decision .
In principle , we are opposed to the closure of parties .
This does not solve anything , Minister , yildiz Taner energy .
This decision completely boycotting the democratic opening launched by the government , commented on the political analyst Ahmet insel .
We can expect , of course , a reaction by the PKK , added .
This Thursday , the PKK was awarded an attack which killed seven soldiers three days earlier in the north of Turkey , one of the bloodiest attacks of recent months .
New Silicon Valley
For many years , was considered a secret city , inaccessible to Western visitors .
Selenogrado , one of the ten districts in Moscow , was in the Soviet Union a site heavily jealously guarded secret for research of weaponry .
Today , the Community of 216 000 inhabitants , located 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow , is viewed as the " Silicon Valley Russian " .
Here are important research centres and production of micro and nanoelectronics .
Since September 2008 , representatives of selenogrado have contacted riedberg scientific headquarters in Frankfurt , with university institutes and companies of the Centre for innovation in Frankfurt , fiz ) .
There were various mutual visits and now , on Wednesday , selenogrado and riedberg sign in Frankfurt a " Protocol of close cooperation ' .
The vice-alcalde rosljak JURI investigators and the Mayor of selengrado , Anatoly Smirnov , spearheaded the Russian delegation ; by Frankfurt signed the head of schwarz Edwin planning services .
In 2010 will be travelling at a seminar in selenogrado representatives of fiz and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the research centre of natural sciences .
Scientific exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange .
But it also addresses trade relations .
The fiz companies will be able to get a foot in the Russian market growing .
To change Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany .
Selenogrado is the seat of major companies and research institutes Russians .
These include , for example , the Moscow Institute of electronic technology , the big energy companies sitronics and rossijskaja elektronika .
The Community was founded in 1958 as the so-called " socialist " town planning for research of weaponry .
Selenogrado ( literally translated as " Green city " ) was named forested mountain landscape , in which settled research facilities .
Checks of Stuttgart
The Stuttgart 21 dimension is not sufficiently high places for nothing .
Supporters of the draft dealt with simply of " the new heart of Europe ' .
The law so . S21 is much more than the reduction of a railway station , rather than a monstrous construction project , which plunged to the capital of the region of banden-württemberga a decade of chaos of irremediable construction sites .
Stuttgart 21 emanated from the spirit of the 1980 's .
With rails terminals , which end up in the middle of the city , were considered engineering fossil at that time of the nineteenth century , who acted as checks of a modern rail traffic , as was formerly needed an enormous amount of time for bound back locomotives forward .
Though we stopped in their tracks , continuing their journey ; but that must take place .
And why should disappear terminals : in Frankfurt and Munich .
And in Stuttgart : a station of step , which is approximately half of the route of the trans-European lines of operation between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava ; hence the slogan " heart of Europe ' .
The s21 really will be initiated , despite the visions of the 1980s will no longer be compatible with reality .
Even more ambitious designers have known that in the capitals hessiana Bavarian and is almost unpayable implement the reduction .
The railway terminals of course also have more problems of entry and exit , since there are locomotives reversible with unity tractora bandwagon and the driver at both ends .
However : Stuttgart 21 including the new tranche built ice towards Ulm already will be launched .
The federal political communal and have ready as well .
Rail continues , also because the risks of the great individual projects of infrastructure of the Republic leads them the taxpayer and not the state .
From the point of view of houses , the project is still justified to some extent .
It creates new urban space , with many green areas , probably the graphics of designer generated by computer .
For the railway transport system the s21 is harmful .
The step and the road support intended for the transport of persons , that was attached to the huge growth typical of the 1980s .
At that time were not given the competence of low-cost flights .
But the first modern transport policy must address strengthen transport of goods , since the carriage by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by lorries on the roads .
However , the new segments in construction we are good for freight trains due to the intense gradients .
Even more serious is that the s21 also affects indirectly to many other projects of railways .
More than six billion euros should be buried in the .
That is the official number .
Experts reckon that is more realistic between ten and fifteen thousand million .
It is certain that in the next decade the money be lacking in other crossings and close passages in the network .
In total sixty larger projects are in the list of the Ministry of transport .
One of the most important is the expansion of more than 180 kilometres riel long through the Rhine valley .
Since 1987 is built the route forward slowly .
It is urgent that raising the game here properly .
However the s21 acts as a brake .
The stretch of the Rhine valley , will be the bottleneck for international freight transport : through the heart of Europe .
The government is considering the judgment on the airport .
The federal government omits Wiesbaden sittings of Parliament , if it is going to lodge an appeal before the judgment on the prohibition of night flights of the Administrative Court in Hesse .
The coalition of CDU / FDP appears to have commissioned experts legal research of the judgment of the vgh , more than 400 pages , as stated by the Minister for the economy , Dieter posch ( FDP ) .
The Administrative Court in Kassel had grounded in writing on this date , which in the case of the construction of the runway north-west planned at the Frankfurt airport , the state should regulate again the prohibition of night flights .
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and the 5 p.m. , as foreseen by the Federal Government , would not be compatible with the mandatory legal protection of the population of noise due to air transit .
The coalition has to decide until 4 January , if you are going to present the appeal against the decision .
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressed the government representatives for refusing to appeal to the Administrative Court of the nation in Leipzig .
The head of the group SPD , torsten schäfer-gümbel , urged the CDU and the FDP to respect its promises to ban night air traffic , which had made before the elections , otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech .
It is rather difficult , if you leave keep its word , said the head of the Greens Tarek al-wazir , referring to the slogan of the FDP " we keep to our word ' .
The Minister posch rejected the admonishing schäfer-gümbel , that the federal government would be trying to through distortions of the right and tricks still obtain their night flights .
A comprehensive legal investigation would be quite some time .
The coalition would not act on the basis of a ' first impression quick " .
We need a decision legally irreproachable , said Stefan Müller ( FDP ) .
As represents the opposition , would not have been ever the assertions of his group on the prohibition of night air traffic .
US banks replenished subsidies given .
The big banks shaken by the crisis disposed of their state restraints .
The " Bank of America " returned of a lump sum aid extended to him the banking rescue fund TARP has a total of 45 million ( approximately EUR 30 billion ) .
And also the Group citi plans to restore state aid , according to a report by the cnbc of United States .
With this the institutes seek to get rid of restrictions which had gone hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money , as for example the limitation in the bonus payments managers , as well as the payment of high rates .
The " Bank of America " had secured some 19 billion liquid money through convertible bonds .
The rest of the sum was taken by the fund , that too few resources available , among others by the sale of items .
The banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked on Wednesday evening especially to American taxpayers : the financial injection helped to overcome very difficult times .
The Bank House had miscalculated the effort of the absorption of the investment bank in the climax of the financial crisis .
The Group citi also aims to get money in the capital market in order to discharge its obligations vis-à-vis the state .
The cnbc reported source of known circles , which the United States Bank could announce already for this Thursday , increasing its capital by $ 20 billion .
A representative of the Group citi did not want to comment .
In June had already returned its aid JP Morgan chase Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
Rapid election
In the end , was faster than was thought .
Barely two weeks after the administrative council of the German television channel ZDF ( ) presionase the editor-in-chief of nikolaus brender to resign , the channel may submit a successor .
Yesterday evening the Committee wanted to vote on the candidate .
The front-runner was Peter Frey , Director of the study principaldel ZDF in Berlin .
There was no confirmation of this by officially the station , not to anticipate the procedure .
But surely also had no further damage to the director of the ZDF Markus schächter , if this proposal does not be adopted at the administrative council .
Frey , the candidate of schächter , needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the Council .
The result of the vote was not yet realized the closure of drafting this edition .
Two weeks ago schächter failed in the administrative council with its proposal to renovate by another five years the contract of nikolaus brender .
Only seven Members supported brender , seven voted against him . The dismissal of brender was a bitter failure to schächter , but a failure to be expected .
By that most of the Union in the administrative Council already weeks before the election had indicated , that would not support brender in his post .
The opposition against the editor-in-chief had been organized by the President of the government of Hesse , the sr.roland Koch .
Another mandate declined the editor-in-chief of prestigious with the argument that , under the leadership of brender ZDF would have lost the news of the indices of hearing .
Until shortly before the elections there were protests due to this , in which flageló political influence on ZDF .
Eventually had been interfered in the debate 35 specialists in public law , which described how Koch as unconstitutional .
But not avail .
On the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in bingen .
Political studied , teaching and románica languages .
Then worked in the südwestfunk " radio and in the newspaper ' Frankfurter Rundschau . "
In 1983 been changed to the ZDF , in principle the informative " heute-journal . "
Following stations : 1988 until 1990 rapporteur staff of editor-in-chief ; 1991 / 92 correspondent in Washington ; until 1998 director and driver morning agenda " morgenmagazins " ; until 2001 director of the foreign policy of ZDF ; since then director of the study of ZDF in the capital .
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional complaint following the removal of brender , which was elected even this Wednesday as a journalist of the year by means magazin " medium . "
The opposite of Koch in the administrative council , the President of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate , explained last week that the Federated States should change the state 's Convention ZDF so that the proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a majority with political motivation .
A withdrawal of politicians supporters of guilds ZDF control was removed by Beck .
The likely successor to brender , Mr Peter Frey , recommended to the administrative Council with a smart move : criticized heavily about trade by the removal of brender .
Thanks to this test both schächter journalistic independence could name for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face , as the administrative Council I was able to vote , without being suspected of to the post to any such thing in favour .
In the calculations of parties Frey is awarded anyway left Liberals .
The academic careers removes
Partial success for students : after a year of strikes relating to education , the ministers for education and culture of the Federated States finally relented . In a meeting of the Ministers for Education and Culture with university rectors , both sides agreed to try to improve conditions of study in cases of degree and masters courses .
Students should in future be able to overcome their careers .
For example , it was agreed to reduce the burden of examination : basically each career module should conclude with a single consideration .
In addition is to examine the workload of the students , and it wants to guarantee a ' real and justifiable . "
Politics and universities to simplify further the recognition of examinations results between universities inside and outside Germany .
The federated States undertake to establish more flexible structural rules as a whole for careers and master degree .
Regulations of the federated states that dissent from this , it should not exist .
Less reviews
Since the beginning of the student protests in June , the ministers for education and culture and the Presidents of universities speak constantly improving undertake and successfully concluded a race ( estudiabilidad ) .
Now for the first time there was talk of a substance in particular .
The so-called accreditation Council agreed to drastically reduce the number of tests : ' Every module ends with a only consideration , " said in a document 30 pages , which seeks to regulate partially the adoption of the academic careers .
With the " appreciable reduction in the burden of examinations would prevent development in the wrong direction , which significantly affect the estudiabilidad , I explained the director of the Council of accreditation , Mr. Reinhold Grimm .
Furthermore , in the future , the " estudiabilidad ' must be the decisive criterion in the configuration .
The modules and content must be closely examined in terms of unnecessary restrictions of students in the election of ..
The courses .
Students have ' the right to obtain more areas , that enable and encourage its own initiative ' .
These rules would be valued at for careers in new , but also at the examinación of existing careers .
These must be " reacreditar ' again every five years , but this would mean that it would take until 2015 to examine all races .
Those responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies , which are under the supervision of the Council of accreditation , that is installed by the Federated States .
The Ministers for Education and Culture called upon the Federated States in October influence so in the agencies , that the number of subjects and reviews are not too strict or demanding .
In some federated States universities and technical colleges already agreed with the ministries for such measures .
So far only renania-platinada assured provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process .
With this money universities must implement tutorials and student counselling , as well as strengthen offices of examinations and from outside .
The land and universities are intended to provide EUR 10 million for these purposes .
In early 2010 the government wants to bring to Parliament a novel of law at university level .
It should be sufficient a single consideration for the completion of a model of career .
Fashioning the race should be made more flexible , in addition to ensure the recognition of evaluations in other universities and facilitate access to master .
Until the end of next year is to examine all races about his " estudiabilidad . "
This Thursday , the government and the opposition discussed again on conditions of study in the federal state .
A part of the praise there was also criticism about decisions .
In the board of directors at the federal level of university groups juso ( Young Socialists ) seexigía , that the shape of educational policy is no longer should conduct " behind closed doors ' of the ministers and the university rectors .
At the latest after of strikes of education , now students and most closely involved should have their say too .
The President of the board of university rectors ( refugees ) , Margret wintermantel , gave its support to students : ' We need the experience of students , " said on Thursday , at a meeting with the Ministers for Education , with which the refugees deliberated on a reform paper whole .
For the Union for education and science ( ( gew ) the Bonn agreements were not sufficient : the Union requires a legal right to each student degree with the title of the possibility of getting a master race later .
In addition the Federated States have to ensure , that for the current generation of students degree of exist in a future sufficient places of study to master with the best possible study conditions , as a Member of the reported ( gew , Mr Andreas June .
The federated states have quecontratar significantly more teachers .
But on greater access to master , education ministers did not comment .
More than a footnote about France herta Müller
" entering and leaving Germany is virtually without any controls ' said the first line of a poem by lyrical Werner söllner in fragments desequilibrantes language , which usually addressed the experiences of arrival in Germany experienced by a dissident , who gained their freedom , but it lost the environment of their language .
Werner söllner , who was born in 1951 in banat , Romania , worked at the beginning , as a professor of German and English in Bucharest , and then as reader editorial in a children 's books , before moving to Frankfurt in 1982 .
To söllner gave him several prizes of literature , in 1993 provided the famous lessons or talks of poetry in Frankfurt at the university Goethe , and since el2002 is Director of the forum of literature in Hesse in the mousonturm in Frankfurt .
Given that speak quite last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about " German literature in Romania in the mirror and disfigured the mirror of their dossiers of Securitate "
Visibly unsafe and ashamed , söllner read out a statement in which he admitted participating as im in the Romanian secret service Securitate compared to colleagues alemanes-rumanos writers , among other Richard Wagner , William totok , Franz hodjak , and Helmuth frauendorfer .
In conjunction with some of those present in 1989 , söllner had received the prize of the German language .
Attempts to recruitment had begun slowly , early in 1971 .
" So I am someone who have not insisted sufficiently despite attempts to provocation of fear of the Securitate ' , söllner ended .
The lyrical Werner söllner is im Walter .
Almost at the same time the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to France herta Müller and its controversial unparalleled literary mechanisms of dictatorial rule , it undermines the scene literary and especially the Community of German authors from Romania for a case which demonstrates the chasms and the evil of a political system , which is based on control and espionage .
Werner söllner is , as far as is known so far , is not only author but also victim .
In the case of Securitate im Walter had played a role , said the scientist literary Michael Markel following the denomination of söllner , and stressed the influence positive for him delim Walter .
He apologised or defended in all the difficult points for him , said Markel .
" I feel the moral imperative to make this assertion , " he said .
The declaration of söllner in this way and confront this public was unexpected , the confession of a ex-disidente and work with the Romanian secret service , however , it is not surprising both .
Germany would have been a comfortable refuge to spy gewesen , wrote the securitate-spitzel France herta Müller as long ago as July in the weekly " Zeit ” , having read its own dossier 914 pages .
Those involved have surely speculated and will be known in some cases , what names hid behind the pseudonyms of sorin , voicu and also of Walter .
Unlike the revision of files Stasi with a controlled procedure in Germany , dealing with the files of control by the Securitate is still fairly vague .
A systematic clarification was boycotted and hampered in recent years .
A National Council for the clarification of the files of the Securitate ( cnsas ) , corresponding to the authority birthler , formed in 1999 , and the delivery of files since then is more dragged .
Since 2005 , there was a law which regulates the administration of files .
An interview , following the award of the Nobel Prize for literature to France herta Müller , proof that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large . In this interview a ex-jefe of the Securitate of temesvar spoke disparagingly of the condecorada .
" It has psychosis , " she finally only once .
The infamy of power appeared to be able to show without turns in the form of freedom of opinion .
Of course , there are unavoidable questions with the case söllner , as so often when there is blame silent .
Why right now ? who would caused damage ? the calm reaction of listeners off the confession of söllner leaves hoped that the continuation of this story governed only by the taste for knowledge and not so much by the allocation of blame and shame .
For the genesis of the works of France herta Müller , who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize for literature , is more than a mere footnote .
The Champions League as to fill the stomach garrison
When the new team vfb soccer coach in Stuttgart , Christian gross , accompanied by a plastic bag of colour orange of the supplier of his team , addressed a taxi Mercedes class C a quarter of an hour after midnight , gave the impression that a Member of the external service elegantly clothing was emerging from a very pleasant holding Christmas , in which the manufacturer of sporting goods have distributed samples .
The man of the characteristic baldness had recruited a driver , due to the fact that he did not know the city .
Incidentally , it would also have been able to steer the auto himself - at the end of the day , there was no alcohol at stake , and nor was drunk of joy men of 55 years .
Had been an evening palatable , but tomorrow would start work again .
Or would start for the first time .
In the words of the Swiss , who had been recruited just three days before : ' It is true that we reach the end octavos ' , namely in the Champions League , thanks to triumph 3 1 against unirea urziceni , Romania , " but we cannot be blinded by the success : we will have to fight against the decline brutally . "
The most important task much " les expected the next Sunday , stated .
Then it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the " real " classes in everyday life in the league .
And to eliminate the weaknesses , which have been shown clearly again , after the rapid three of marica assiduously ( 5 ) , träsch ( 8 ) and pogrebnyak ( 11 ) .
Lots
The octavos of end of the Champions League matches ( IDA 16 / 17 and 23 / 24 February / parties back 9 / 10 and 16 / 17 March sortearán ) on 18 December in nyon .
So remained limited fulminant joy at the entry of the successor to babbel .
Not only on the assumption that will shortly Salvador had inspired the Stuttgart bewildered profis self-confidence , willingness to surrender and taste for the game .
I went to the players and told them that I had to concentrate on its strengths , I urged be more launched , explained the repairer of souls gross its recipe for success so simple sounds , but as the babbel therapist no longer have been effective .
He displayed a certain magic , accepted the supporter of babbel , Jens he , " as in football arises fresh impetus , there are sometimes things that would not have believed possible . "
And khedira Sami , that after a gap of several weeks due to an injury advanced immediately to become the best player local thanks to their dynamism , tried to describe the “ perceived phenomenon " with the proverbial " wind " and way of working of the new head : he is a man who intervenes thoroughly , and requires discipline .
That is what we need in this situation . "
And that is what has been missing , of course , when I was babbel .
The vfb Stuttgart has not gone still proof , warns steering the sporting heldt Horst
But the vfb Stuttgart needed above all noted .
Like gross , also players and the administrator abstained overvaluing the victory against a defence weakened by lack of renewal and completely overtaken of guests Romanians .
It also had won in Glasgow , before four days later in Leverkusen with 0 : 4 had reached the sad awakening , gave to think khedira .
Steering and Horst heldt warned that although it had been reached an objective of the season , the other was still very far .
We have not yet overcome the problem .
That heldt had no appetite for in his birthday number 40 , even after the first victory in its headquarters for three months , was due to the events of weekend , who returned to be updated in the form of a television interview , transmitted just before the start of the game , who had given the doorman Jens he .
There are decisions taken by others , and not Jens , faced heldt the harsh criticism he .
It had reproached weakness in the direction the board of directors , which had been decided to change trainer by pressure from the fanatics adolescents .
It also had been eliminated their free day after the games he described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility .
The statements of he were “ marked by the pure selfishness , " he replied heldt , and announced impact on the zaguero .
Probably will no longer be friends forever , the two cuarentones .
But at least agreed with all the others in that , without previous efforts with the team of coach replaced , would not have been possible the spectacle of great strength of game and battle .
Babbel and their assistants had “ strong involvement in the success ' , and he said heldt in unison ; and also agreed the man of the suitcase plastic .
Fight World Cup heavyweights
Ardent mourning in Bern : again and again the challenging Kevin johnsonn was causing the world champion Mr. vitali klitschko with words and gestures .
But after twelve tough rounds , Ukrainian defended its title of heavyweight in the version of the wbc .
The trial of judges was unanimous .
HAMBURG : klitschko Mr. vitali remains world champion of heavyweight .
The champion of 38 years in the version of the association wbc expired on Friday evening , on Saturday in Berne American the Kevin Johnson by unanimous decision by points ( 120 : 108 , 119 , 120 , 108 , 109 ) .
For klitschko was its third successful defence of title since their return in October 2008 .
Previously , the Ukrainian was twice now world champion of associations wbo and wbc .
Unfortunately , were not able to carry out the noqueo that everyone had hoped for .
Klitschko expanded its balance sheet to 39 triumphs in 41 fights professionals , twice had to give up because of their injuries .
The challenging Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his fight number 24 .
To some 17000 spectators in the sand of Berne , klitschko , with a stature of 2.02 metres , wanted to make the fight especially with its power left .
But Johnson , eleven centimetres lower , that before the mourning proclaimed the end of the era klitschko , was to side-step again and again of the blows of the world champion , so klitschko could not carry decisively to its aim its dangerous skilful .
In general terms , liabilities Johnson made too little for a challenging , and only tried to move the rounds .
While was causing to klitschko with words and gestures , its blows only rarely reached the world champion .
However , he is now the second a Boxer , after Timo hoffmann in the year 2000 , which it weathered twelve klitschko full-scale rounds .
Before the fight , the challenging had already been true scandal in the capital Switzerland .
Had insulted klitschko as " horrible Zombie " , that ' cannot do anything . "
In undertaking the weighing the champion , was allowed to provoke the Friday to rob Johnson glasses of sun nose " in order to see their eyes . "
Fourth triumph after the return of klitschko
Also at its fourth scramble after their return on 11 October 2008 , klitschko remained invincible .
After a gap of almost four years , expired at that time to the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin , and had regained " their " belt of the wbc , which had previously had to deliver without a fight .
In that year fell after their defences of title to Juan Carlos Gomez , Cuba , and in September to Chris arreola , of the United States .
In this fight only received a blow , and am very good physical condition , had explained klitschko its rapid return to ring .
But their dream remains collect every four titles important in his family .
His brother Vladimir is world champion of associations wbo and ibf .
However , the belt British belongs to the David Haye , after it destronó in November to Nikolai valujev , 2.13 metres height .
In the previous summer , Haye had cancelled a fight against Mr. vitali klitschko scheduled for September .
Supposedly , the company which promotes is planning because the fight against klitschko at the Stade Wembley , London .
The case kunduz
Frontal attack of opposition : the head of the Group of the Greens , Jürgen Trittin , called liar Defence Minister , Gutenberg , owing to false information on the matter kunduz .
The SPD and left-wingers require explanation to Chancellor .
HAMBURG / Berlin – after the most recent revelations on the kunduz air attack , the opposition has reproached the Defence Minister , karl-theodor zu Gutenberg ( CSU ) , have deceived with knowledge of the facts .
In issuing news " Tagesschau " on Saturday , transmitted by the television channel ARD , the head of the Group of the Greens , Jürgen Trittin , said that the Minister “ knowing had not said truth " on the murderous bombing of two convoys .
In such a case , they usually said : he said lies .
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the international force of protection for Afghanistan ( ISAF ) .
This is the essence of the report that had NATO , and read by Mr Trittin Gutenberg , said .
On Friday , it had made it known that in this attack not only sought to destroy lorries abducted , but also to intentionally killing two Taliban leaders .
In the air attack in the United States , requested by the German kunduz commander , Colonel Klein , according to the report of the investigation of NATO , who died or were injured until 142 persons .
The Greens , the SPD and the left they called on Saturday , a Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) to take action immediately before the Federal Parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident .
Mrs Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of the intentional killing is part of the policy of Afghanistan by the Federal Government , and if the Chancellery , the army and the information service have adopted this new strategy , demanded Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Greens Renate Künast .
The government spokesman , Ulrich Wilhelm , decisively overturned criticism .
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not exert any influence on concrete actions of the German army in Afghanistan , said .
On Saturday , had also transcended doubts about the presentation to the Ministry on the grounds for the dismissal of the Chief Minister Wolfgang schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter wichert .
According to information from the Spiegel , both had informed Gutenberg correct and completely against the background of the attack on the convoys .
It is officially had said that they had denied the existence of reports of NATO and secret sensitive details to the Minister .
However , since the environment of the two senior officials , it transpired that they even had noted the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports , including a two-page document of Colonel Klein , who was in charge , and a report by a patrol in the field .
Meanwhile , wichert had sought in a letter that clarification of the matter , brings the Journal ' Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung . "
So far has received no response , it was said .
The Ministry is not expressed on Saturday , regarding the reproaches upon it , and pointed out that this would be cleared up in the Committee of Inquiry of the Federal Parliament , which will be the next Wednesday .
Oníricos worlds
In a state of vigil , some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear .
Not only in the case of the mentally ill and in drug addicts fade the boundaries between the imagination and reality .
While happen during the dream , everything is in order .
When we are acostados in our rooms dark with our eyes closed , we can overcome without hindrance to the most savage imaginations and creations of fantasy .
However , who faces similar States during the run-up to the dream , or seen and heard things that others do not see or hear , it considers most often in the Western world as crazy or modern addicts , or at least as maniático .
But such images and voices not only arise in the mentally ill or in the drugged .
The blame lies with our imagination : the same neural processes that enable us to devise houses , paint tables or write novels , sometimes make a blurring of boundaries between the dream , madness and reality .
The States of conscience oníricamente modified warning can appear in the most diverse forms , at best call them visions , and at worst madness .
Although there are able to distinguish the triggers and impacts , may be passed on to similar processes visions of the essence hildegard von bingen , psicodélicas experiences of the prophet of the new era Carlos Castañeda , states of possession , and the chamánica psychosis and hallucinations .
Hallucinations or the mania appear when it has descarrillado the balance of neural substances in the brain – especially the dopamine , noradrenalin , serotonin and nicotinic – and is disrupted the interaction between different parts of the same .
During a schizophrenic psychosis very frequently appear complex hallucinations insane and thoughts .
The gravity no longer has power over him
The relationship between madness and dream has concerned philosophers and doctors since the former era .
Aristotle hallucinations conceived as a form of sleep in state of vigil , Wilhelm griesinger , one of the founders of the modern psychiatry stated in 1861 a " great similarity of the state of madness with States oníricos , " to Sigmund Freud , the dream even was " a psychosis , with all the absurdities , alocadas formations and mirages of this ' .
Is the autumn of 2001 , when Henning T. becomes a figure of comic .
His body is two dimensions and outrageously colourful .
The gravity no longer has power over it , is floating near the roof of the room .
He is a kick .
Behind it , figures of demons with wings , with muecas Rojas such as blood , deformed , rechinando teeth .
We are pursuing them , and they flameantes heavy with shoes , cast against the walls , he feels the pain throughout the body .
Strident voices and malign resonate since the walls and radio .
Can no longer withstand it , the voices who insult and offend .
Henning T. grubs up two of the stereo cables , the amarra to form the core of hanged , and the fixed at a hook at the roof .
You climb in a bocina and puts the noose around the neck .
Salta .
The rope is rein .
What you can serve as a lesson ! ' say the voices in a chorus Le is bursting the tímpanos , “ sees the clinic and enable te heal ! "
Now , Henning T. has 40 years and has experienced acute six psychosis , the last two years ago , the first almost 20 years ago .
The cause of death was LSD .
Its diagnosis is esquizo-afectiva-paranoide psychosis , is also maniaco-depresivo , takes medicines , against depression , mania , schizophrenia .
You have learned to live with his illness , for three years is married .
In the psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair , said .
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one per cent of the population falls ill at least once in their lives of schizophrenia ; in psychiatric clinics being treated as the second most common disease after the depression .
In a schizophrenic psychosis acute , most often those affected are no longer able to distinguish between the outside world and the interior , and fall into a state of sobreexcitación can lead to hallucinations , delusions of grandeur , upheaval in the relationship , or rabble-rousing propaganda mania .
Particularly widespread is the hearing voices : voices which give orders , discussed or dialogue .
There are plenty of optical hallucinations .
The affected is no longer able to distinguish what is important and what is not , the brain can no longer filtering disturbing signals , awareness is inundated with impressions .
As the dream , also psychosis opens the floodgates to a torrent of ideas and visions that come from the deepest layers of consciousness .
The perception of reality in psychosis focuses on the subject , said Professor Thomas Fuchs , medical head of the general psychiatric clinic Heidelberg University Hospital .
The schizophrenic lies at the heart of the events , everything has its meaning addressed to him .
At the same time enters a passive role , as in a dream , is overwhelmed by events and cannot organise actively .
That is why the schizophrenia are often threatened , controlled and manipulated .
In general it is not possible to adjust the reality to them , hallucinations are a cruel reality , the wake up , impossible .
Having experienced a deluded once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream , said Fuchs , " the spatial structure and sensory of reality that can be seen in the psychosis remain in principle as it . "
The thoughts paranoids hallucinations and based on reality , the alienation of the experience takes place in reality .
For researchers still unknown why our brains is unfortunate mishaps .
According to Fuchs , the state of emergency could lead to any person to lose touch with reality on a provisional basis .
But not all people develop a psychosis .
There seems to be a genetic provision for schizophrenia , but twin studies have shown that in addition to genes there are also other determinants .
The researchers assume that those affected suffer brain damage minimal .
We suspect the neural maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development , for example through a viral disease mother during pregnancy , explains Fuchs .
But it remains to be seen how this alteration of the neural system , which , moreover , is manifested at all for many years .
Also the influence of environment plays an important role – the stress or a traumatic experience can be the trigger psychosis when there is already provision .
Similarly , the hallucinogenic drugs can cause a psychosis , as they interfere in transmitting the system of the brain .
When the brain heats up
As illogical of all this is that people suffer with their psychotic hallucinations and take medication very expensive to get rid of them , while others have to pay for drugs that enable them to experience some , said professor in psychology Erich kasten , in Lübeck .
The perceive a deluded as pleasant or not depends frequently from the point of view .
Kasten collects from ten years ago reports on hallucinations and visions and has analysed the results in the book irreale Die Welt in unserem Kopf ( the world unrealistic in our head ) , published last year .
Hallucinations typical symptoms are among the accompanying psychosis , but , surprisingly , of many other diseases .
These include , alongside emotional disorders such as the limit of personality disorder or depressions , often diseases such as the migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , Alzheimer 's and head injuries .
Surprisingly and under specific conditions , the brain healthy people also suffers hallucinations .
The hallucinations , according to kasten , consist of memories normally found repressed .
Arise when the brain areas in which are processed perceptions are hiperactivas sensory or are little cohibidas ; when our brains to warm , but also when there is a lack of incentives .
Drugs can cause this state in the same way as the brain damage or a psychosis .
But also the restriction of incentives , stress , the evil of loves brain or other States of exception .
In jüngeren studien gab bis zu a drittel der befragten an , mindestens einmal im leben Eine halluzination erlebt zu haben .
In the summer of 2005 , Sarah K. had 16 years , lived in a small town of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and came to a secondary school .
A girl flow .
If it were not for these pictures and voices .
Sometimes , during recess , it does happen that a boy clumsy with long hair dark and addressing to you the floor .
When it says , other pupils the look soprendidos ; no one hears or part thereof , sees the boy .
They believe that the timid girl is a ensoñadora a little odd , but Sarah K. knows that it is not dreaming .
Is arouses and sees and hears the boy , in the same way that we see and hear the girl granted in the Bank .
Can feel even their presence , at least some moments .
It is a feeling , likes the boy .
Sometimes wonders whether one is crazy .
He also knows that the boy and the rest of visions are not real and disappear .
Nightly , appearances are alarming .
Visions are often a burden .
When it is in class sometimes cannot follow the lesson because Professor – their eyes and ears – is presenting a new colleague , while for the rest explained so visible and audible the mathematical equations .
Nightly , appearances are alarming .
Whilst waiting in the dark room for a dream , which often arrives late and is scarce , is not able to tell whether is arouses or dreaming , if the images we see , the muecas or girl acrimonious with cuts in arms and legs , are faced with their eyes open or closed .
Let me in peace , I cried figures .
Their parents and friends not told you nothing , would believe that is crazy .
Autumn 2009 . Sarah K. has hoy20 years .
Adopted last year selectivity and live with their boyfriend .
A year ago hallucinations that have disappeared .
Since it has gotten through the Internet with the psychologist kasten , knows that is not mad .
The madness is also a work of art by despair .
According to kasten , when a person is socially isolated or suffers a restriction of stimuli , it is highly likely that after a time begins to have hallucinations .
I believe that the brain is yse vacated by the same traced entertainment .
Sarah K. , daughter , it had only small fear of other children and often played alone .
Their hallucinations began when , with 13 years , we learned that the man called Daddy since has reason is not its biological father .
Since the visual hallucinations noise and are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noise , for those affected as Sarah K. find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality . " each experience , " says kasten , “ takes place in the brain , the reality is projected there .
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain occurs , therefore seem so real . "
Kasten night fantasies also classified as a form of deluded .
Healthy people hallucinations do not differ fundamentally from those of a psychosis acute .
Unlike the schizophrenia , mentally healthy people are able to recognise their visions as unrealistic .
Kasten therefore recommends to their patients who see its hallucinations as a special skills .
Extreme situation between fantasy and deluded
In this world too focused on the conscious , experiences often imaginary generally patologizarse , said Michael schmidt-degenhard , Professor at Heidelberg and chief physician clinic and psychotherapy florence-nightingale-krankenhauses psychiatric hospital in Düsseldorf .
A psychosis is a disease tough and painful but which also involves something positive and creative – the madness is a masterpiece of despair .
Schmidt-degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirismo , a special form of consciousness , which is perceived as if it were a dream .
Oníricas hallucinations are almost dreams very detailed and complex that the person who is experiencing considers real and that subsequently cannot differentiate of be awake .
States aware oníricos arise in extreme situations associated with a trauma or illness , as for example in patients with polirradiculoneuropatía , experiencing a driving paralysis still completely conscientes. die EIB vollem bewusstsein Eine motorische lähmung erleben .
According to schmidt-degenhardt , when a person is threatened by a loss of oneself or the world because of a total and permanent motor disability , it replaces a real situation very dangerous for a world of their own and fable which is decoupled from reality .
A form of extreme situation between fantasy and deluded .
Because it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality , there is a change of world , but the real situation lingers in the imagination .
An intensive form of give sense and interpretation into an unbearable situation itself that our own capacity of creation allows us not sink into nothing of the loss of consciousness .
Everything is real , even later in the memory
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius claussen , Zurich , describes their experiences oníricas in his book herzenwechsel as the soul of a rescue .
Had 49 years , when their conscience embarked on travel of several days following an operation of the heart valves with transplantation of heart included , while his body was sentenced to immobility in intensive care .
Claussen descended into a world created by the same and visited places strangers other times : was lying in bed , an older man on board a sanatorium on a train , a robot ensures their health .
It was in the early Middle Ages , surrounded by noble producing drugs from blood .
A Greek on a Moto the abducted in their country of origin , made surf on his hospital bed in the Alps firn snowy and was welcomed Korean mafioso .
It provides all these facts in theory , everything is real , even later in memories .
For claussen , these journeys interioresson fundamentally different from any dream .
Dream is a different state , describes their experience .
On the contrary , memories of mental travel are , many years later , much more clear , even in the details irrelevant .
Even clearer and intensive that actual experiences .
The intensity of this experience diluted the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences , adds the schmidt-degenhard psychiatrist .
Finally , the oneirismo , psychosis , hallucinations and drugs show how fragile the reproduction is internal reality outside , even when we are awake .
Every modification of the state of conscience , sums up the psychologist kasten , " can lead to a distortion of what we call reality . '
An experience which , furthermore , may be completely enriching .
Snow can come
Gross
Children will be responsible for the editorial with 27 years
The new editor kallen has reached a provisional solution : Hubert gross wants to leave their company in the future in the hands of his two sons , commented to Spiegel .
The 100 % of holding will also be in the hands of the family .
HAMBURG – the publisher Hubert gross sees its business in the hands of their children in the future .
The two children become heirs with 27 years and are committed to enter the company , confirmed gross , 69 years , Spiegel .
The details have been managed as a precautionary measure .
My next question is whether they will participate actively in the company .
Also , if they are able to do so .
One cannot put 7,500 redundancies in front of their children , whether they are not adequately trained for this .
This would with children and also with the company .
Gross released on Thursday , which will withdraw from January the Chair of the management board and that paul-bernhard kallen has been appointed as his successor .
This family member kallen , 52 is since 1999 Member of the direction of gross .
Initially was responsible for technology .
Later , was responsible for the Treasury and thereby came the responsibility on the heritage of the company . Following the departure of Jürgen todenhöfer also took charge of direct marketing , abroad , printing and finance .
For the first time , no Member of the family is at the top of the publisher .
The children of gross have 19 and 17 years . His son Felix , which currently have 42 , died a few years ago .
The designation of kallen also serves to , " bridging differences of 10 , 15 years ' , according to gross .
The 100 % of holding will also be in the hands of the family .
With an eye on cases schickedanz and schaeffle , gross stated that family businesses are not safe from the decline : ' This has always affected families who are transmitted by the desire to search for capital , which have misjudged and thought that could rise as well as the largest player .
That had never been my strategy .
I have never had " delusions of grandeur , " says gross .
I do not see this as a political coach of this country , as it was Springer , and I do not want to play with the “ time ' in the world league ; these businesses have become too great .
The promise of fonpeek
Peek is extremely limited , a device that serves only to look at the possibility of mail , without even see some kind of Deputy or surf the net .
Enjoyed five minutes of its reputation in the US when he was appointed time magazine one of the products of the year .
See you on the street is more difficult , the truth , but the idea may be interesting , particularly for young people .
Unlike the smartphones peek , has a very low price and a monthly quota very low , less than half of what is paid by , for example , the plan iPhone database .
Given the success the company has brought two new devices : one solely intended to Twitter , the other with a free service of data for life in exchange for pay six times more for the peek .
Fonpeek , submitted yesterday in the event , it is the European version of the invention and its third encarnaciónn .
It is equally restricted than its American counterpart , but comes with a surprise .
The price of monthly maintenance , around 12 euros a month , includes the roaming across Europe .
Those who are travelling with a smartphones already know what is having to renounce the data when it crosses the border or desperately seeking a bar with WiFi ( or a connection of fon ) to consult the mail .
The idea of a roaming at a flat rate is incredibly attractive and long ago that should be in operation .
Yes , some operators have special agreements and travel plans , but in my experience requires a doctorate in physics to understand and good spectacles to read the small print .
The repeated hair ears of the European Commission to ensure affordable roaming tariffs across Europe have hardly had a perceptible effect .
Outside the home country there are afraid to use the data , and rightly so .
That a aparatito as fonpeek ( then it is curious that carry the name of fon when lacks WiFi ) achieves this tariffs means that operators start to think differently and study different proposals with which recoup their data network .
Kindle is another good example , includes trafficking of unloading of books and other consultations on the Internet .
Without contracts and without bagpipes .
It is a device connected and pay for it not to buy , month after month .
And that is what I hope to see one day with fonpeek , a purchase option with access for life as peek which already has in the United States .
Not because there will buy it .
I look my mail on the telephone , thank you .
I hope so because we believe that this is a fairer model for the consumer .
It would be interesting to see a computer with this same system .
The colour of Michelle Fetish
Yellow is undoubtedly the preferred tone of the American first lady .
If we went to the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the US with a clothing and a safe haven of this colour , has chosen the same to accompany it in , without doubt , the second most important moment of his life : the collection in Oslo , the Nobel Peace Prize .
Michelle Obama has led a model very similar on both occasions : in addition to being a similar colour -amarillo verdoso with brillantes- reflexes , twice the dress is composed of three parts -vestido , jacket and shelter in the same tela- , and adornaba with a great embroidery or collar .
So much so , that at first glance it seemed that the first lady of United States was in the wake of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestaurio .
But the fabric which are drawn up the two costumes makes them very different .
If the inauguration of was a fat , fit in Oslo is a velvet stamped with .
Also supplements have changed : Green shoes tacón half the again , and a similar model , but in Dorado , now .
And equally different was hairdressing : a reflected on this occasion , melema rein the previous one .
75 % of working mothers labour has had problems for motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
It reveals the study ' fertility and labour trajectory of women in Spain ' , prepared by the csic in collaboration with the Institute of women .
The survey conducted between 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years leaves no doubt in that respect : 75 % of working mothers has seen limited opportunities in the field of labour because of motherhood .
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation of couples and the number of children , depending on whether or not they work and of the type of work .
Those who do not have work outside the home , part-time work , or have a stable , begin soon cohabitation of couples , promoted the first motherhood , and have more children .
On the contrary , women with stable employment , mainly in the public sector , retard coexistence and motherhood , and have less offspring .
" women aged between 35 and 49 years with fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after initiating coexistence , which rises to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have required more time your record vital to achieve them , which has led to the postponement of the Union and the arrival of children .
In addition , the type of work played exercised considerable influence on motherhood though less on the timetable for the pairing-up ' , it explains the researcher csic Margarita Delgado .
The level of education is another factor that difference the age of women to marry and to have the first offspring .
According to the survey , the higher the level of education , the greater the age at which are married and have their first child .
The difference is also among women of the same generation .
For example , in the group of between 35 and 49 , which have studies , colleges have been mothers for the first time and 25.1 32.1 of media respectively .
" further provides another division among women on the basis of their qualifications .
While the elementary school are married and have their first child before achieving stable employment , the average levels or higher invest this sequence and gave priority to stable employment as a precondition to marriage and the arrival of a child , quipped " thin .

Cowardly aggression
Last week , my mother of about 70 years old walked by our neighbourhood in the municipality of fuenlabrada when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 years spent together to it and to our dog , a copy of race mestizo , rescued the perrera and with no more than six kilos and , without any word , they beat him two kicking the dog that left badly injured .
Our indignation is glaring because we cannot find the fun in a free aggression to an animal small defenceless , which incidentally was tied .
To this we must add the suffocating that caused to a lady who walked quietly and that , when increpó these individuals , came to fear for their physical integrity , since a energúmeno that strikes an animal , is able to do so with a woman , a child , an elderly person or , ultimately , with whatever weaker than himself .
This incident happened at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon either by a neighbourhood traditionally calm .
The dog was crying all day .
Incidentally , we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt that fits much and not to generate sensitivities , only to clarify that the cowardly murderers were Spaniards .
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact .
We do not understand that is happening among young people to consider free amusing abusing defenceless an animal that we gave affection , company and friendship .
We do not know where there have been good education and respect for animals and humans .
Michelin and fesvial together for the use of the hull

Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of his commitment to road safety , which ' goes beyond design and manufacture products increasingly safe ” and asserted that it also contributes to this aim through other actions of pedagogic nature and informative .
This new campaign to promote the use of hull in motorcycling , under the slogan ' to be or not to be ' , will be a first stage that will be distributed posters in more than 500 workshops motorcycles , with the goal of maximum dissemination .

Rising light commercial sale of
Almost two years later , the light commercial vehicles market begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel .
The 9.425 units enrolled in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines , according to figures from employers anfac producers and sellers ganvam .
The good thing , not osbtante , it should be put on hold because the reference that makes comparison - November 2008 - was particularly bad , with a decrease of 60 % over the previous year .
The consequence of this is that , despite the resurgence of last month , enrolments accumulated in these 11 months are 40 % below those of the previous year .
Since January 95.853 units have been sold together all vehicles forming the mishmash of light commercial the : derived from cars , pick up , vans and lorries / light vans belonging , lighter chassis .
We also have not disappeared the clouds that most affect their demand , because although they are bought by individuals , most of the purchases are carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises , which paid in almost 100 % of cases through external financing .
So to the restrictions which represents the tap closed on bank loans , must add other factors such as the increase in levels of unemployment or the persistence of the economic downturn .
Against this background and unlike cars have been of little help , aid for the purchase of the region .
To them are eligible , in addition to individuals , the self-employed and SMEs that will acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , but the number of operations has been testimony .
Only yesterday , since ganvam returned to recall the need to devote particular attention by the administration to these vehicles and also to industrialists ( lorries and buses ) .
The association of sellers forecast a similar to the year 2010 , for which estimated a fall in sales ( cars and 4x4 ) of 19 % .
The emergency brake assist is already mandatory
As happened with the anti-lock ABS brakes and about the control of stability ESP , the brake assist systems will have to be an emergency compulsory element in European cars .
In fact , they already are in all passenger cars and light commercial vehicles of re-registration , while for the rest sets a minimum period until the end of February 2011 .
The measure , imposed by the European Union , is aimed at increasing the protection of pedestrians although , for his way of working , can also help prevent many collisions by REACH .
The assistant to the emergency brake what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency , that the system detected by the pisotón which gives the driver .
But this does not always maintains that pressure until the end .
According to a study conducted by the manufacturer of components for car Bosch , one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not reached stepping on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not use the full force .
Until 1,100 accidents
The intervention of aid , however , requires a maximum the brake system , reducing the distance employed by the car in stopped .
According to a study by the EU itself , if all cars equipped with this type of elements , we could avoid the year until 1,100 fatal accidents in which children are involved pedestrians .
The reduction will be still greater - estimates that it would avoid one of every four sinister with damage to people - when it popularicen so-called intelligent system of emergency brake .
In this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that ( through a radar or a house ) detected obstacles and alert the driver , in addition to act slightly on the brakes .
If the driver reacts , helps to increase the pressure on the pedal , if necessary .
If we do not react , and although the collision is inevitable , the device exercises maximum effort into the brakes in damage limitation .
General Motors delayed until January the plan for Opel

And this can make the final document will be subjected to workers first and then to the governments of countries in which there are factories , be delayed until the beginning of 2010 .
Instead , from GM ensures that a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the coming days .
This is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible .
GM admits contact with some new potential buyers .
One of them could be geely , which also aspires to acquire Volvo , but gains strength the option of Dutch manufacturer skyper sports cars , which is backed by the Russian converg group .

At the wheel of spyder boxster Porsche
For desarrolar his last , and expensive jewel , engineers from Porsche took boxster s as a basis and managed to adelgazase nothing less than 80 kilos , leaving the báscula in just 1,275 kilograms .
This lead them to dispense with , firstly , the ceiling automatic that has been for whom one of dirt drive with manual , thereby saved 21 kilograms ; using aluminium doors as the gt3 , ' are ' other 15 ; taking away the climatizador , 13 ; reducing fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres , won 7 kg more ; bacquets established sports and with the other 12 tyres light weapons of 19 inches , five .
Finally , renounce the audio system cdr-30 provided a further six kilograms and changing the gunmen gates by some of fabric , the remaining kilo .
Although it provides to change PDK of dual embrague , the test was carried out on a unit with the Fund manual of six speeds , mainly by secondary roads in California , in mountain tranches with set really revirados
Their behaviour can only be described as flawless .
Reducing weight does not imply that the car not tread the asphalt with grace .
Rather , the opposite : was long testábamos not a model so small and light that , once , transmit such certainty through curve , even at higher speeds .
It is a small athlete , capable of heat their muscles in a short March during the time required , until ordenemos him that esprinte , which slowed , to re-establish and return to squeezing its engine ...
What I ask , and thanks to your leadership , to be as forthcoming as accurate , which we share with our hands in the leaflet is what the car will .
And it will do so with a surgical .
Motor sound at will
The sound of its v6 Boxer , with 320 horses ( 10 more than the boxster ( s ) is very achieved and could be enhanced with an option ' sport ' and through a system that amends the roar of engine , really already previously in panamera .
The capacity of acceleration is brutal , whether from unemployed person or in recoveries .
Derogations are firm , but not tough or inconvenient .
The asphalt roads that we are experiencing with the boxster spyder was quite punished but the car digirió well the potholes .
Electronic aid were hardly presence throughout the journey ; and yet in some curves are at dawn and ice pellet , already well into the morning .
In short , a car ultra light , of the most amusing that one can lead in the market and that is more than just a modification of the boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010 , with a price of 70.831 euros .

The team vitoriano known address the important absences of herrmann , oleson , gardens or micov with large doses of involvement and collective work while had to suffer until the end to cope with the victory .
Moreover , the very sensible step since the perimeter , with 16 annotated triple had a lot to do with the ultimate triumph .
The party started looking for the azulgranas , which came from the outset ahead in the scoreboard .
That the first four baskets of the vitorianos were since the perimeter was presage who had come to the Israeli court with hot dolls .
English and teletovic were the main architects of 18-20 at the end of the first partial .
The second fourth was more of the same , but the equipment alavés chose the internal game of barac and work of Eliyahu , which was received with pitos and applause in the return to their home , to continue to expand its advantage to rest ( 34-43 ) .
Teletovic already started to be highlighted as the best of his team with 13 points , although the ' least six ' assessment of splitter were already expectation that there would not be the best night of Brazilian .
But the party , despite being on track to rest , was not decided or much less and the macabeos wanted to remind the vitorianos that in its scope does not win anyone , and with ' the hand of Elías ' tightening managed to meddle in the party .
Eidson and pnini contributed decisively to the ' yellow ' get back to Luminoso ( 50-49 ) .
More disadvantages
Those of Ivanovic , injuries but far fewer deaths , spinning needed a couple of rightly time you bet for breath , and in these came the machine gun of Mirza teletovic , that with three consecutive almost triple and aid of English and ribas returned the scoreboard to an income reassuring ( 54-67 ) , which managed to disguise the premises at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .
The alaveses sweated came to in the past partial and English and San emeterio ( 60-75 ) already gave you would not allow themselves to take what had been received during the first thirty minutes .

Brazil is out of date Zelaya
The Brazilian Government has made deadline endurance of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa .
The deposed President must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 , though formally should complete its mandate .
Francisco catunda , chargé d of the Embassy of Brazil in the Honduran capital , reassured TV globe that " Mel " knows that he must leave before that date the embassy , where he is refugee since 21 September .

Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since last spring , in which the asset inflation has been prevailing in markets , of new uncertainty again reappear in markets , which it is not surprising since it is their natural state , in an environment where actors take decisions on the future by nature uncertain .
Medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was monetize debt to direct sale of assets and indirectly by free-for-all liquidity for types close to zero for financial institutions to take account of asset purchases .
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have virtually completed and , without questioning its heterodox policy of liquidity , begin to take some sand in the wheels how did the ECB with its auction a year of next week .
Therefore , investors doubt the global economy 's ability to maintain economic recovery without measures as heterodox and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction of risk premiums .
The volatility of the stock markets and spreads corporate bonds have returned to rally , although still far removed from paranormales levels which reached at the beginning of the year .
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt returned to fold .
There is once again a flight to quality and the USA , Japan and Germany have been the shelter elected by investors , causing a differential expansion of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany .
Spain had scarcely been affected by this episode of instability but that arrived Standard & Poor 's and threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain .
On the other hand , some uncertainty it does no harm to silence the defenders of moral hazard again attempting to create awareness by those responsible for global economic policy by have stopped the destructive effects arising from the restriction of credit on the destruction of jobs , when what we should do is to enact a new thanksgiving .
However , Dubai it portrays a tribal struggle between the emirs to reshape the power in the Emirates and of Greece we have seen before .
A government that conceals public deficit , elections and a new government that is pulling whistle-blowers .
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso .
It makes no sense that Ecofin salvase Hungary of a breach of its external payments at the beginning of this year and that will allow a Member country of the euro to meet its commitments .
What does have logic is that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and do jointly responsible for its citizens from the necessity of extraordinary measures to maintain stability of public finances .
If , as we hope , we face an episode of normalization of risk premiums transitory , after some excesses in positions , would be leveraged within expectations .
In the case of Spain , while our differences in public debt expand like the European corporate bonds should not worry us .
If European spreads dwindle and ours continue to expand , then that would be risk idiosyncratic English .
The Standard & Poor 's is an anecdote . When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of studies to anticipate its scenarios of recovery and to increase its scenario for 2011 , including the OECD and the European Commission , to return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not augur very life expectancy at its warning .
Again , is absolutely pint that would be an excellent opportunity to buy assets Spaniards , even though for the moment " prudence , friend driver . "

The President of Iberdrola , Ignacio Sánchez Galán , was the first to speak yesterday to the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in the currently being debated the energy strategy of Spain in the next couple of decades .

For the President of Iberdrola , Spain needs to invest EUR 50 billion to 2020 and other 60,000 million between that date and 2030 , provided that they are kept open nuclear power stations in operation today .
If not , the necessary investments will not be 60 billion , but up to 95 million .
That yes , Iberdrola considers that in the next decade investment must not be used to increase the capacity to generation , but in distribution networks and international interconnections
From 2020 , the issue is changing and it will have to be increased power .
Its bid focuses on both gas and coal plants with mechanisms for the capture of carbon dioxide and , above all , of renewable energies .
In this case , believes that we need new 18,000 MW , albeit with other energy ' support ' .
Galán , which considers that the bill of sustainable economy just adopted by the government is in line with what his company has been demanding blood , did not want to do with the Royal Decree to incentivise the use of national coal , which contradicts policies to combat climate change .
In his opinion , there is " a clear commitment to the long term ' in this regard , despite the measures ' glue ' called the President of Iberdrola .
Be that as it may , Galán believes that investment decisions , although in the long term , it must begin to take as it takes to mature and we need a stable framework retributive to address them .

Existing Catalan , champion and the last winner of the defunct European Championships in 1992 , is the fifth classification .
The list the champion Manchester United and Bayern Munich , the two teams which , moreover , more money invoiced by participate last Champions League .

The last four referred to embolsarán 4 million each .
The champion won 9 million , compared with 5.2 million from the practical .
Thus , fixed in payments , a club will accede at least 7.1 million , and a maximum of 31.2 million .
The Barça moreover , pocketed 2.5 million to win the supercopa of Europe in August .
But furthermore are payments variables , for which they are intended 337,8 million .

We identified the model to repair through its number of bastidor , appears a graphic image of real model in question and then you select the spare parts necessary .
The user can include variables as the price of labour , a premium or discounts , and then can give the budget to surrender the customer .
Audataller is not a tool of assessment as audaplus , but rather a catalogue of references .
The main difference between the two is that the aimed at the workshop does not include estimated times .
The cost of using this tool for the event is EUR 350 per year , that the customer can finance .
Currently the company audatex is working to ensure that these images are three-dimensional .
This is an innovation that mechanics view very favourably , as it will , for example , select a door and go around to see the face interior .
