A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justifièrent their policy by the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the Centre Brennan as a myth, saying that the electoral fraud is more rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, the lawyers Republicans have reported only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organisation of the United States federal elections.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010, which is perhaps add 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 Member States.
Accordingly, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new electoral laws require that the voters have an identity card with photo and proof of US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also help reduce the voting times in anticipation, invalidates the right to register as voter the polling day and withdraw the citizens with a legal issue their right to vote.
Before the elections in 2006, no state required of American voters to present an identity card with picture.
Indiana was the first State to put such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities is empressèrent to extend this practice in other Member States.
Over the last two years, they parrainaient projects of law in 34 States to force the voters to present an identity card with picture.
It is important to note that, unlike the Quebec, the US citizens have no identity card as the universal health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million people of voting age, have no identity cards with photo issued by a government agency of their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a coin of identity.
However, it is often more than 100 dollars for the identity card required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect the young, minorities, and those on low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35 000 dollars; 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters of 18 to 29 years do not have the required with photo ID card.
Much more.
Students, the voters considered voting more to the candidates Democrats, are not allowed in several Member States to use their identity card with photo from their institution.
However, these same States allow the Members of the fishing clubs or hunting that vote more of the Republican side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen Member States have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two Hispanic voters on three promote the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, Republican legislators have sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters the polling day in eight Member States.
They have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to the voters to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, when the general election of 2004, the registration of voters have contributed to register around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have driven of 17% the rates of enrolment of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
Moreover, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other States in order to reduce the period of vote by anticipation.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in anticipation were African-Americans, while they were only 13% of voters in the state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They were only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, whites which were 76% of voters were only 46% of voters voting by anticipation.
Of course the legislators, Democrat and their supporters are strongly opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several projects of law have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors Democrats.
The Advocate-General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 on 34 States have enacted laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with picture.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
The criticism Democrats advocate denounce the laws that have been passed and they see a clear objective of influencing the results in 2012 in key States.
A report of the Centre Brennan of 2011 demonstrates that the Member States that have adopted these laws are 171 of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will affect negatively the rate of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test results would sometimes misleading, with false results negative or even of false positives, which lead to unnecessary of medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to move from screening tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a great deal of contamination between the groups, it is therefore difficult to interpret these data and firm recommendations.
Another study European one, has concluded a difference of death among patients who have had a screening and those who did not have.
This study has also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, between 30 and 40% more chance of having of metastases if it is not uncovered.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if a parent who has already had a direct prostate cancer.
African-American men of origin are also more at risk.
The key is to take the right decision once we have detected a cancer.
There are cancers aggressive and others who are indolents.
It really must understand the patient the degree of risk his cancer, offering him the possible options, not treating necessarily prostate cancers which do not infringe to life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men in which we detect cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest to the active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them a treatment.
Increasingly, it determines with accuracy of the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should move or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of urologie, Movember has created a tool to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately there is no miracle formula for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good habits of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
We believe that if everyone ate well and move sufficiently, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
'If no longer smoke, this rate grimperait to at least 50%', underlines André Beaulieu, spokesman of the Canadian Company of cancer.
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by their offspring.
Several remain unexplained also fully.
For the Canadian Society of cancer, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other.
This is damaging to the health of people.
'F today, 1.5 million of smokers in Quebec' deplores the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after the abandonment of smoking, the risk of dying of cancer halved.
The weight
The embonpoint and obesity also promote the emergence of the disease, according to the SCC.
They accroîtraient the risk of breast cancer, colon and the rectum oesophagus pancreas, and of the uterus.
'The research shows that the regular practice of physical activity during a whole life protects against colorectal cancer' ajoute-t-on.
Food
The body also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risks to be achieved a colorectal cancer.
The charcuteries also, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by lived or drying curing can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
'In recent can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer', can we explain toddler.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the links between the supplements vitaminiques and cancer.
Their research, however, are not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them was a reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talk about its concerns and his family origins with his doctor.
'pass the test, it does not give cancer'.
The Higgs husked
The announcement of the discovery of the likely Higgs has created quite a commotion the summer, and to cause.
We believe that this mechanism boson is responsible for the mass of all in the Universe, nothing.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or 'least bad' explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the matter - but which has not yet been empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet entirely sure whether the Higgs.
We know, without any doubt that we take a genuine new particles, and that it is very similar to the Higgs predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data revealed this week at a major conference of physical, in Kyoto, seem to confirm, but we still lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Suppose that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem insignificant, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law inevitably essential that two things cannot be at the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and do not try too strong, you will do badly.
Even if the physical world is a very strange, it turns out that it has also a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same area at the same time if they are in the same 'quantum State' - this' state 'of roughly in some of their characteristics.
Here, physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In a corner, there is good citizens appointed close, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the dirty sifting, a gang of anarchists which have respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be at the same place, at the same time.
These detected then fall into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, elsewhere) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: the mésons, that we cannot tackle here, and the 'particles of force', by which the major forces of nature is spreading and which the Higgs is somehow related.
These bosons-là, we must stress this here, are not all of the poor little bugs also alien as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary: the banality photon, or 'light' particle which is the 'messenger' of electromagnetic force.
When, indeed, a particle having a burden of electricity or accelerates change of direction, that '' the scope of electromagnetic in this place, a bit like a pebble launched in a pond.
This' disturbance "the electromagnetic waves (light, or, infrared and ultraviolet, etc.), and this is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, a force of sifting 'with'.
Scope more stable
The same applies with the Higgs, this difference is that this is another field, the scope of Higgs, which must be 'disturbed' for this boson arise.
However, this scope of Higgs is far more stable than the scope of electromagnetic; for the whip up, we must achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a pond frozen which only a very big rock could Rider the surface.
That is why it is a huge accelerator of particles such as the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of outer circle! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the scope of electromagnetic again is useful to explain the report between the Higgs and the mass.
This are not all particles, or all materials, which interact with the scope of electromagnetic.
Some, such as the magnets, do, but other not - a piece of paper, for example, will never itself on a fridge.
And the same way, it is not all particles which interact with the scope of Higgs: those that do have a mass, while the other (as the photon, want) have not.
Now, what does' can provide 'all these research, Mrs Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also enables us to examining any gap between the comments and predictions of MS.
They are also several hope fervently that this is because the slightest difference could open a door on a 'new' physical and plugging holes of some Modèle.
This, it must say, has still huge shortcomings, proposing no explanation for the seriousness (oups!) or the dark, which form around 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
But it has not found such differences at CERN until now.
Repercussions
The repercussions of these research in the everyday lives of Mr and Mrs street, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not.
Take: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser, in the Laboratories Bell, do not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.
In fact, we have already said the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself has developed the first laser continuous (the first were pulsés), in 1962, initially the laser was rather seen as a 'gimmick of labo'.
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instruments which surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small sensor of light in 1969, during its work in view.
This sensor, although this was not at all its original intention, is now 'eye' to all digital cameras of the world, and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physical 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care – The best way to die | The Devoir...
With his Commission die in dignity, Quebec recently debated the sensitive question of the end of life.
The debate should resume shortly so that a draft law.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
The Devoir has tried to look more closely.
There are a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived still only in his apartment the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer which the rongeait had left a respite two years.
'They I had given five years to live, I have seven years, he says,' but ', lying in bed in the home of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where he came before.
'But it is always a shock, we cannot be prepared to it', he says.
The disease its weakness: a huge that it cannot go only to the toilet, and even of eating alone.
A very appetizing and appealing Attablé before lunch, he will be helping to eat, resigned.
Courageous, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are busy around him, to make its medicines, offer a bath.
The courage of the ordinary death.
'My greatest desire is that we would cure of diarrhea, it is humiliating' confie-t-il.
A few hours later, the 'team has found a solution to this evil.
'In our lives, one learns that a man, recounts pisse standing' Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Reversing the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
'It depends on the ability of the person' to accept the regression, identified.
Because of the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the heart of this decline.
Patients who enter the House of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses that surrounds them does not mean more care so-called 'therapeutic'.
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is dying 'aware and suffocated'.
But the disease, I took my children.
'I have good children', strong-competition.
'I do not wish in life' she said, before we accept that it poses a mask for the help to breathe.
It expects, in the next few days, a last visit his son come to Italy.
To Victor-Gadbois, it provides, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and aid for food.
These are palliative care, that it is when there is nothing else to do.
To make the lives more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are a palliative care for 11 700 people.
It is very little when we know that we all dead.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dre Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the House.
At the level of comfort or physical, emotional spiritual.
The dying, we will accept care of mouth the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be obliged to monitor their sugar level.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, it has served a beer to Mr X, died during the night.
This morning, it is his son which will conclude beer at the feet of the deceased.
'We support the relatives as patients', recounts Nathalie Savard, head of care.
In the home Victor-Gadbois, the days go by but does not resemble.
Alongside an old man 93 years which are relishing their final assembly of family in the Court, of stalled in its oreillers while it is falling in its credit, a young man of 36 years tragically dying, surrounded by its parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried to survive.
'For six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by the cancer under the age of 45 years', is concerned the Dre Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the House Victor-Gadbois arrive home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to a palliative
It is said that 77% of Canadian simply do not have access to the palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate the suffering when a patient is reached the final stage of his life, whether at home, to hospital or in care homes.
And various bodies, as the home Victor-Gadbois and the League of palliative care at home, the Grand Montreal specialise more or less exclusively in the care for cancer.
It is precisely this major shortcoming in the healthcare Quebecois of who fear of several specialised doctors in palliative care the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed leading experts the palliative care which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to the Dre Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecois of is not good enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to the palliative care of quality before we agree to carry out euthanasia.
Recently, it says, I saw a patient move 14 days to the urgency, in great pain, to make the necessary for the relief.
I fear that patients want to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And the same time, several oncologists act on their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The expectations of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when it has abandoned chemotherapy challenging one.
When I announced my oncological I arrêtais treatment, she told me that it regretted that I shall stop to fight, she told me.
However, it had told me that I was over!
Not care all-powerful
The Dre Martel believes that 90% of patients who want to die thanking carers of not having agreed to ask them after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But we must say that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care to the League of palliative care at home of the Grand Montreal, patients would be reluctant to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors have so often palliative sedation, which amounts to hijack the patient until his death, is intermittently, be permanently.
We cannot pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the sick not relieved will have the possibility of having this sedation palliative.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: 'I want to die.'
But this does not necessarily mean 'I want you euthanasiiez' means' I want to be relieved '.
The achievement of this report has been made possible thanks to an exchange of journalism the Institutes of research into health Canada.
Large-scale property scandals in Quebec
Officials of the roads, entrepreneurs, the construction of collectors funding of political parties and specialists from the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know a great 'system', the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A 'industry', which has cost taxpayers dear Quebecois of, especially in the 1990 and 2000.
'It is curious as the system is decreasing since we took the great resources', ironise Jacques Duchesneau, a deputy in Quebec and former chief of police in Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal erupted in 2011, by means of an investigation of embezzlement relating to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had made that backwards.
The 'report Duchesneau' establishes a direct link between industry, the hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials.
'Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he insists, the only Transport Ministry could have spared a billion dollars on contracts, some réfrénant their instincts to reach a quota!
The Commission Charbonneau 'has already brought two mayors' ajoute-il, hoping that it gets' demonstrate the stratagems behind individuals'.
A permanent unit anti-corruption, created in 2011
Anti-corruption permanent Unity, created in 2011, is also working with its army of auditors, investigators and analysts of government.
More policemen of the 'escouade Marteau' which, since 2009, would have led the 'cartel' sewers Montreal to put the brake on the gonflements contracts...
In recent weeks, it has carried out raids in number and made accusations of fraud and corruption against elected, as municipal Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city suburbs.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which has just resigned his office of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is alleged to have pocketed bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally charged by the engineers to the roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
It has quite a stir in explaining to the Committee on the mechanics of the 'system for obtaining public contracts.
He has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts achieved in Montreal an intermediary linked to the fact that money to Union reversait Montreal, the Party of the mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has sown in all directions in the years 2000, giving more 88 000 CAD (approximately 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
It had also have organised a collection of illegal funds for the liberal ex-vice-premier Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts which he gonflait sewage costs
Has Montreal, the 'corruption' system works well.
Gilles Surprenant ex-ingénieur in public works, the detailed before the committee: in 10 years, it has received of gifts construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, watch hockey and bribes totaling 736 000 dollars, in exchange for contracts which he gonflait sewage costs.
Other officials have admitted to the roads to be done smear in inflating 30% to 40% bills, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin, has accused Mr Dumont Tremblay of having deliberately a blind eye on a budget parallel fueling coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned early November, plunging Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau has been one of the first elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, is of the island, it reacts from 2010 against the sale of a ground municipal bought $5 million and resold... 1.6 million to promoters, in the housing boom.
70% of dirty money in the election campaigns
Of the inquiry that will finally be put in place, it says that it draws on a course to understand the operation of the system, infiltrated by ant, to stop the gangrene and pinpoint the culprits'.
The process, it says, is' painful but positive '.
We are cleaning up the wound but it should be a unit of Inquiry own in Montreal and monitoring, not to see a return of the dubious practices.
As the household.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau note that 'officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars', but is primarily concerned the role of 'elected aware of the game', when they do not in the politicking trempaient!
Believing to 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it ironise: 'They told me that this was a pale reflection of reality.'
The government proposes to limit Quebecois of $100 donations to the parties but this will not change the situation, according to him: 'When we do not strictly limit expenditure, there will be of dirty money in politics'.
It advocates a complete review of the system for granting of public contracts and funding of parties: 'We cannot go more low; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will help rebuild the House on more solid basis, with more controls and laws'.
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau urge those who are laughing to look in their own backyard...
'The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!'
This season, you have taken a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an awareness of the individual but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players arrived.
Every day, I move at their side.
The technical staff I have also contributed much.
On a daily basis, these elements lead me to put my game.
And, in the match, it is easy.
Everything will very quickly in football.
But I do not catch fire.
My start at the centre of préformation the INF Clairefontaine to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always put forward by gradual.
You are therefore benefit of competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits this summer are used to argue matches very high level.
They also know that every training is crucial.
As a player as I want to face and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
It is supported by the assistants as Claude Makelele, who was at the same position than me.
Ancelotti is the man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti respected in all the technicians.
Today, it has not matched by League 1 and part of the best European trainers.
It has great experience and has gained a lot of securities with clubs brigade.
It has passed through major players.
I think it will win other headings to Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
I say a number of injuries.
The confidence that it gives me also explains my performance.
How would you assess the first part of the season PSG?
League 1, in Lyon we took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our key objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the final 8es with the way.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
Firstly, we want to finish first of our chicken, in Porto, to receive in the 8th final return.
The PSG can become a great European club in the short term?
It has already the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs win securities and to be included in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means for this project to fruition.
In League 1, not win the title, as the last season, would be a failure?
Of course, this would represent a big disappointment.
This year, we really have at heart to pocket to champion.
The last season, it is not gone far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities finally first.
It has done a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, it is supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has done a fantastic season even more.
This year, I believe that this is the right.
Even if the big teams like Marseilles, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win.
Do you feel that the media PSG expect too much?
It is only natural that we expect a lot from us in view of what has been invested and players that we have.
We fully accept.
After, when you earn 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there are still things to reproach ourselves, it is certain that it is somewhat frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all the weekends.
It is not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a project of game.
A team is being built with the time.
It was shown in the Champions League that we could respond.
Look at Manchester City which does not happen, since two seasons, to qualify for the final 8es, they have also made huge expenditure!
In view of the sums invested, you imagined with 15 points forward to the truce!
It was neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not the last season, have been inspired by this new PSG.
This shows that the League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have the smile saying that, despite all the difficulties, we have ultimately prevail.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the deeds of you Ibrahimovic.
So much the better that we say that there is a 'you' dependence.
This means that have very good and that it highlights many goals.
It is time for it and it shows that it is the star of the League 1.
It has demonstrated wherever it is past that it was a great global player, a star.
Within the group, it respects human rights and the player.
It also respects men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
It pushes the other to hoist their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How do you lived the 2012 Euro with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I had to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me to garner the time of game.
I have seen things there and I am emerged stronger.
Today, I have to achieve good matches selection.
That is what I had hoped for my baptism with the Bleus.
We have learnt lessons from what happened in Ukraine and today needs to have an exemplary behaviour.
How would you assess the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of Bleus?
It has the results for him.
It is well placed in the Group of the word for the World Cup.
The sélectionneur is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the gains.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparisons.
White had achieved its objective by calling for the Euro.
I hope that will lead the Didier Deschamps Bleus Brazil.
The good no (1-1) reached on 16 October, in Spain is a founding match?
This has given us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced match the same in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, of transactions identified and the costs of treatment between the stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a protocol of exchange for the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files hand in hand in hand.
Around 200 000 transactions have already been registered with 15 000 computers on the network.
A small thousand Web sites accept the bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having achieved a summit of EUR 30 dollars (23 June 2011), has fallen to USD 2, five months later, before going today around a dozen dollars (are recorded on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as the 'virtual currency with more success', 'in competition with the dollar or the euro' and 'similar to the conventional currencies'.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currency as the 'appropriations', used to make progress in a video game that you earn playing or that we can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social networking site Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority control and trafficking trade.
With Bitcoin, all the difficulties of the network are both depositaries of the book of Auditors, Auditors, issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users actually between two e-mail address to the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose an address different for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of encryption to double key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded exist in the book of public accounts and broadcast in the entire network.
The milestone is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and which the winner, provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this line.
It is a phase of hachage of file, i.e. transformation of a major file in a digital footprint shorter and unique.
Computers' take 'the new transaction and add a number of grinding' before '.
The aim being to find the number who gives a hallmark (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number found, the other difficulties easily check that this is the right.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all the other transactions; any change would change the mark.
If, to commit fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining an orphan because the two have fingerprints different.
The computer having resolved the challenge is to win 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this prize is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until cent millionth, which leaves scope...
The difficulty of the challenge is also raised at every increase in the power of calculation.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the deposits bitcoins in stolen.
'The should be used is not the Protocol itself', ensures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency Bitcoin using the network.
The ECB is also of the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this service anonymous.
But the cash also has this defect.
Serious players like Wikipedia refuse the donation of this nature.
Other, as the platform of blogs WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Institute Weizmann in Israel, have analysed the book of Auditors and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins is not passed.
In November, 'balances giants' have been launched.
'Thirty thousand dollars have been traded' welcomes Jon Holmquist, which works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins of gold.
Stone Noizat, who also has a pedagogical Paper on this currency, is a great believer in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, and which are cheaper.
The bearer manages its identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement the traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to communicate a telephone 'can only a snapshot and recognise', precise Pierre Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general trend of questioning the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
'It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point', prédit-il.
The ECB, in his report, is to reassess the different risks, now considered as high, in case of success of this currency.
We are parties to Afghanistan.
And after?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army take possession of its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without expect all of us.
This is particularly the Afghan peasants that we have punished in the recital as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former Heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign military presence, as the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they were joined by jihadists, Arab, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by the local insurgents, they will not be when the West will be more modest.
The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, that I have observed the top of hills almond trees planted of thanks to the appropriations French, has done in order.
Convoys of lorries and tanks joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no flood of the Taliban on Kabul at the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their advanced irresistible from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country to blood and fire in the struggle between various factions.
Their control of the country was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of obscurantism of these farmers overtaken by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved our days.
Old mujaheddin, current Afghan government and Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notable war anti-Soviet returned to power in 2001.
They have calcified into business, seizing land government to sell them in land to build the refugees returned from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American 'contracts of subcontractors.
They are déconsidérés; most of them have not fought themselves.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and ideologies.
They have passed through the modern world in their exiles in Iran or in Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul account now 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full, girls and boys.
It will provide work for these young people who want more return to the obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of leaders.
All, including armed opponents are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities which are the Commission be regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the fight anti-Soviet care already to rebuild the provincial militias, which will in the central power.
Afghanistan, land of mountains, the strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralisation, to the image of Western nations, but the US wanted to turn it into a centralised state, strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not control foreigners in particular to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country is, since the 1950s and well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been called in road, no dam is in a state, no system important irrigation is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
Noise has been widespread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This has only add to the feeling that the West 'were not there to take them over.
Without energy to treat the iron ore or copper on the ground, or transport to the export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine for Mes huge Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) search the immense Buddhist site and remain the largest employers of the province.
One day we will have to also that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of the French troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: school of girls and boys, the French department University Institute, French, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural support to the Delegation archaeological.
Since 2009, to try to win the hearts and minds and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions, a service of civil-military 'actions' of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and carry out by a small French NGO, a lot of work of collective interest and rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, energy-intensive 'local labour force, were able to help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, trees, soil protection and increase of farmland.
That will we leave as remember, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of local, very tough in the valleys located often more than 2 000 metres.
The embassy received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For that they release of the insurgency carried out by foreign groups that farmers have told me, it should maintain their favour a small civil aid, of controlled and which affects them directly.
Ramming a Constitution in Egypt
It is a new gamble of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, it has decided to play its va-tout.
Taking all the world of short, it announced, Wednesday, that the Constituent Assembly vote its final text tomorrow.
Just a week ago, the leader of the state had given a further two months to this House to conclude its work.
That is almost two years ago that Egypt is based on a provisional text, which weakens amended several times this institutional stability and leads to legal complications.
This new initiative has only increase the gap in the country.
For its opponents, the President is persisting in its' delirium autocratic 'continuing' betray its word 'and' trampling the law '.
The side of its supporters, it ensures that it is a means to put an end as soon as possible with the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
A referendum should be organised in the fifteen days.
A very short space of time which obliges the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.
For President, it is also a way back to a popular legitimacy and democratic while dissent is raging throughout the country.
Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview to the US weekly Time.
All that this appeal to a hasty vote is the ultimatum to Egyptian people: 'Either you vote for my text, I am full powers', these supposedly take to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a very strange that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, to great Islamist majority, the text voted yesterday.
Most of the Liberals were missing from the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had bolted, believing not having been able to assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done likewise.
So that the quorum to be achieved, 11 people, members of replacements, have been added to the rush, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that Articles have been adopted.
Commentators have scorned the fact that one of the only differences of the day has spoken around... the time of prayer, some members of the Committee considers the pendulum of the constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still 'be voted yesterday evening, contains 234 articles.
Deal of attention, Article 2 is finally identical to that the 1971 constitution, stating that 'the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law.'
The Salafi parties, for which the establishment of 'Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to replace' the principles' by 'the rules', which would have enabled a stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of goodwill and their respect for other components of Egyptian society.
'hypocrisy', meet the Liberals, who do not see that a communication.
Because, according to them, Islamisation of the Constitution is through other articles.
They include Article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar an advisory role, particularly as regards checking the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to the expert in Egypt Sophie apple, it is worrying because 'people called has decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the beginnings of a theocracy '.
The fears of the Liberals are also aggravated by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less than the current.
'For the moment, there are no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not of Ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system 'dampening Alexis Blouet, which is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognises that there may be some ambiguity surrounding Article 220, because the words borrowed religious term.
Reference is made in fiqh 'especially' [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the issue in the future could ask ourselves how judges civilians are competent to decide on it '.
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers that it attaches to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are considerably reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Other contentious point: the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Council of Defence.
Neither will be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested the defence of human rights.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, they deem liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, of the press in particular.
Moreover, no article is no longer response to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Whereas Egyptian President must speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The support of the head of state défileront them, on Saturday.

'Who language has, in Moscow will': migrants save money to learn the language
While the Members and the human rights activists polémiquent on this that will give the law on the linguistic test compulsory, fraudsters selling of 'false' certificates have already made their appearance in the countries
Every year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim: to earn money to help their families stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law came into force and states that every migrant worker will have an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule is that those who intend to work in the services sector, housing, services for individuals and retail.
However, with the time, promises the Service, the federal migration tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will have to validate its language knowledge in Russian for obtaining and renewing its work permit.
Are exempt only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language.
People with certificates or education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of centres of examination will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the University of friendship of peoples, the University of State of Moscow, the University of State of St Petersburg and other institutions of higher education.
Immigrants can pass the tests in all the cities of the countries: more than 160 centres have already been opened on the entire territory.
This initiative to introduce tests has been supported by the Members of the State Duma and Federal of migration.
But, before the law in force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what does it will give?
What is the obligation to know the Russian change for the Russians and immigrants?
Firstly, meet the representatives of the migration, it will reduce the number of people suffering 'of slavery at work'.
Much talk of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the Director of the office of the Russian Federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must start before their departure.
Only a system of organised selection will solve the problems to 90% of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to pass dishonest people who, under the pretext of the help, will give him a 'trip' in a crowded maisonnette where he and tens of its similar tourmenteront for months without food and without Paper and slave between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
Vividly them, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, it is their passport, and they do not affect the planned 'salary, confirms the Head of the Directorate-General of services of migration for the work of the service of Tajikistan, migration Tolib Charipov.
I do not stop, Mr the policeman!
However, many of the people of the Central Asian republics who wish to earn money in Russia entrust that they do not only the language of the countries where they want to travel, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen Tajiks, Uzbeks, can afford to follow if only a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families have not even what feed their children not to mention the dress properly and equip them to school.
They arrive in adolescence, these young people leave earn money at the earliest opportunity.
It is difficult when we do not know the language, confient-ils.
'Do you sense fallen and diminished'.
Defenders of Human Rights notice, however, an important aspect of the law on the language.
The tests are intended purely for migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no official examination or work.
However, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia.
'Welcome to enter or defence'
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? the administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, the legalisation costs money: between 12 and 16 million rubles.
And then we can obtain a false registration quickly to only 1 500 ruble.
The Russian police know that we have of false documents, that we have not recording, where the case of extortion.
'They are asking us 100, 200 rubles, to buy cigarettes, tea', has entrusted to journalists Oumed Khouchkadamov national, Tajikistan.
Soon, 'do not then denied and achète-toi a fine work of art'
From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that papers registration of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates examinations of languages have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Service of migration.
Fake papers leave a printer ordinary colour.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: every migrant who hoped and to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and defenders of Human Rights agree that the short-term aim is to protect the system against corruption in that it is impossible to simply buy these 'piece of paper'.
The authorities can give the migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination of the first time to attend language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know the Russian will be proposed a work in areas that do not involve actively communicate with the people.
The Ministry of Interior is not involved in arms market
The crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of Home Affairs is proposing to strengthen the law against the civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: that it is carried out in the firing of marriages or killing organised by the lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov Moscow, which has been seven deaths.
The police to ban the wearing of weapons to rubber bullets in public places and meet the legal age of obtaining of the port of weapon from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the leader of the Committee of the Duma to security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya which has promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Everyone is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to resolve the problem in a mutually the 'live'.
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centres of firing, require to abandon this crackdown 'no'.
The percentage of crimes with a registered weapon is minimal, said at the service Vasiliy Lesnikov Russian lawyer, and specialist of crime to the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, on a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes have been made on the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws on the civilian weapons will not prevent criminals of delivering on the black market.
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior says that we control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: the factory to the officer
The black market weapons provides through several channels.
The main channels are five recounts Victor Baranets, Colonel retirement who served ten years the Ministry of Education and the Quartier general.
Capture of screen off a site taking orders of weapons
The first is the 'trace military', i.e. the weapons that were stolen in the military operations in the Caucasus.
'These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians', explains Baranets.
The second type of arms from the black market are stolen by criminals to the forces of order.
Baranets explains that it is also of weapons stolen in stocks of the police that those stolen directly to the representatives of the forces of order.
Illegal pistols go on sale in the warehouses military.
Many of these latter have often suffered explosions.
"versions attested indicate that some of these fires have been set deliberately to conceal the deficit ', explains the former military.
For Baranets, the arms manufacturers are for something.
'You see factories private weapons which do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, notably in Moscow', tells an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and machine-guns comes from poor countries, as Kyrgyzstan.
'It is a small-scale local production, sometimes, a mafia has trained and organises supply', adds the former military.
Where the weapons?
Experts have assessed the part of approximately every source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the question has been formed in 2011 by the Centre for analysis of the problems and study for the public administration.
Experts have analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, the dossiers criminals and the public data of the gateways relating to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, explain the researchers, just the army and police.
Half of weapons on the black market is found 'by fault of the employees whose work is linked to arms', can we explain toddler in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from the places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen in the manufacture and 5% are from searches' illegal '.
A seller and a consultant armurerie which have requested anonymity ensures that long ago no one is buying weapons found by these experts illegal search; they are too old.
The more often, according to him, sellers will seek the new goods in the warehouses military.
The person buys through a boat a unit, for example, TT a gun.
It is the book in passing the commodity by a fence.
'It the transports in town and resell for 900 €by unity with two shippers' raconte-t-il.
'It is true that the police is aware of all cases, as well, when crimes are about to be investigated, it buys to control illegal arms dealers', the seller.
'As in a shop luxury "
The seller and the buyer are usually through knowledge.
I have consulted sites, blogs, until a kind arises and am proposing to come to the station Begovaya where someone became take me in a corner 'for' bargain.
The price of the gun, I have given on the spot
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know anybody, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there it must also come for example, say 'De the part of this person, who asked me to convey that his daughter has lost a tooth'.
Now I buy a pair of American tie with the help of a person to whom I have confidence.
I am the book only to me because he knows that I shall not.
Small new seek weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets has tried as buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when it was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
Patterns, according to him, have not changed.
It has given a photo album in which there was' that is'.
I believed in a shop luxury ", remembers the military.
There is no secret to the purchaser, explains Baranets, we can try.
As a customer potential, I am not just to buy, we are going with the seller in forest and is a target.
'We leaves me draw and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, one begins to negotiate', described the expert.
A shop since its SOFA
The search engines are the sites and the groups on Vkontakte where we can buy arms' for different uses'.
For this, it does not require any document and person to meet.
'It is enough to be a sum of money, precise' écrit-on in advertising on the site 'Buy a gun or a machine gun battle'.

United States: the employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are on strike
Almost a quarter of US adolescents pass through a cashier among McDonald's
These days, a wave of protests against the low wages is practised by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such that McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell Wendy' and, if Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will take the scale or halt quickly.
These actions are supported by the unions and a number of associations of the left.
Alongside the modest increase salaries received by the employees of basis among Walmart and in the fast-food chains, organisers of demonstrations want to achieve the creation of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving the 'black' Friday, when a rain flood of balances taking million inhabitants has befallen America and triggering sometimes esclandres.
This day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs in the world 2.2 million people, have left their post to organise of picketing with the unions and the left-wing activists in the shops of the company whose products are intended to consumers of small and medium-sized classes.
Walmart commercialises everything: sections guns hunting in the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
That is why many employees poorly paid in Walmart shopping solely on their workplace.
The price and the choice of products made Walmart one of the groups most powerful in the United States.
Critics Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap particularly because of low wages of its employees.
These latter complain also difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklift trucks or air-defence scanners.
The participants of the manifestations of 'black Friday' demanded a salary increase, they complained about the fact that the cost of insurance provided by the company had increased 30 100 dollars per month.
For the employee basis among Walmart which affects 9.5 $the moment, it is a sum that it cannot afford.
Scientists from the University of California Berkley show that if the average wage Walmart increased to $12 hour, it would cost $3.2 billion in the group.
It is 1.1% more of what he spends now.
If Walmart transferred all of the increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the shop their would be to 46 cents.
They will spend in one year only 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine Member States and have been no harm to the group.
The 'black Friday' continued in the shops 8h the evening at midnight the next day and Walmart has sold on this period 5,000 articles to the second.
Its coffers have done in any 100 million transactions for the 'black Friday'.
The spokesman of society Dan Fogleman has ensured in an interview the site of the left Huffington Post that in any less five 'employees of Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a' operation 'COM among many others' from the trade union organizer.
'customer following!'
The protests continued this week in New York and were not more shops Walmart (in this city gradual, they are not very popular, that is why they are not yet established) but the McDonald's and other restaurants cheap.
McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do not even give you leave disease and do not pay the work that you honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided by the federal legislation and New York is $7.25.
Fast food the increase with the time, but little, on average its employees are plumbing in New York 8,90 $time.
Nobody is less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this in New York.
It was a time when nearly a quarter of young people working in American McDonald's after the school while living among their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of income or wanted to stay there for long.
Today, I find myself interviewer McDonald's employees who complain to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
Secondly, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know with what you will be the feed.
The demonstrators who have launched the movement on Thursday at 6h30 almost McDonald's of the 40th streets and Madison Avenue cashiers and demanded that the cooks the fast-food are paid at least $15 of the moment, is a proliferation of more than twice that the current minimum wage.
They took to the unions are created in the catering sector rapidly.
The American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a trade union by bullying or redundancies.
However, the administration their simplifies rarely life.
For a trade union, to grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They do not agree
Other stormy protests were held nearly several other fast-food chains.
The time a beacon of protest has been the gathering in the middle of day almost McDonald's Times Square with the intervention of several policies, including local Democrats Jumaane Williams, a Member of the City Council, who said: 'McDonald's announcement sell billions of portions and after they do not even give you leave disease and do not pay the work that you honestly!'.
The demonstrators were supported by other New Democrats, particularly by the candidate for the office of mayor Bill De Blasio who said that 'we must all support the employees of the rapid restoration for they get a fair pay and the economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterised this demonstration as the most important in the catering sector rapidly in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated without count that not everyone was the bar, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
At the moment, it is difficult to say if the spark of mass movement will be small.
'For the moment, is they-not to deceive the brain'
Recently, fans of new technologies are used to collect the reality increased through special glasses.
At the outset, it is Google which has unveiled this been its current model at its annual conference and in November we have learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is the conversation with the Director of the Group of the laboratory 3D technologies interactive Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists from this society, glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air to bare hands, by creating virtual open spaces.
- would you tell us in a few words what your group of research?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying in the same time to extend the borders of this interaction.
The whole of humanity remained at the moment the pixels on screen sometimes the flat and tactile.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and guess the radical changes which will occur with this interaction.
For example, the equipment and sensors Xbox Kinect are a step forward, and virtually no Xbox is now selling without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order for the gesture.
– What we reserve also the future?
– Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, much is happening on screen dish, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the yield, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on imaging 3D systems really operating on various technologies, including technologies projection.
We must get the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, we must identify not only the user, but also the area surrounding it.
Thus, we can complement the real world by objects in a virtual form more practical.
And to begin, let us get rid of these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
– What do you think of the voice of order?
It is appreciated, but is it not be overestimated?
We cannot say that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because we have not always want to inform the other of its actions or its intentions.
In fact, every kind of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to command the equipment in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not gestures, but rather to gestures discreet, restricted.
The gestures were not caught by the camera of the apparatus, but by a blow to the police from enjoying the movements of bone and muscles.
It is currently great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a shows.
In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint order, for example: gesture + voice.
- It is to say?
– By example, how am demanderiez-vous you can pass this?
You will do this with the floor and with the gestures.
- On the habit, I am speaking only.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognise.
- Well, you want to force people to adapt depending on what the machine can or not to a given moment?
- Not only, but it is a rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work in the drafting of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify the reactions of human rights.
It may be sensors for example, they produce a good resolution in depth and it is very important.
– If one is interested in your work on sensors Xbox Kinect, what you do not like in the modern cameras?
They lack of depth resolution, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are working in our work on the recognition Building.
It would of course to get around 8 mégapixels with a speed of 1000 that /.
But the problem is not the mégapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In relation to this last point, all the current technologies are good enough, this adds the work the designers algorithms.
We must bear in mind the resolution says the axes X, Y, but also Z.
The speed is also very much, the number of frameworks to the second.
The human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 that / is really not enough, especially for the gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our Redmond laboratory has given to reach a delay sensors regular treatment between 1 and 100 µs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this kind in my work, but not requiring touch, for more frameworks to the second.
- Why should we not increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three 'cameras', which is in fact an issuer infrared and the second signal, a receiver of thought.
And the third camera is a sensor's usual scope visible.
It is not to define the depth of the subject.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or the worse by increasing the volume required of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar Kinect, to play with the curve of cameras and to see how this could help to define the locations.
- Autant that I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented his glasses the public.
Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of technologies of the reality, the increased glasses are one of the platforms with the most prospects?
- Of course, walk all the time with a smart phone the catch-the-eye is not practical but what I believe: the best option would be a reality increased 'transitional' which would enable you from a platform Cloud to move from glasses on smart phone.
The apparatus glasses are a very personal and that makes their personal force (the elements are those that you are the only to see) and at the same time its weakness: the reality increased from glasses you will not work on objects virtual in cooperation with other people.
– Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographiques objects in the air is no longer accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea are pointing the finger: there is no tactile sensations!
The hands do not feel nothing!
What answers your group working towards in relation to this challenge?
– In my way, I often say that the reality increased is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I believe that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the technical interesting is the use of the second hand to serve the basis of image.
It is perfectly the pressures!
But there is also of technologies that are actually designed to provide the palpabilité to these 'pictures in the air: for example the interference of several shelves ultrasound directed towards a specific point the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, a breath of air on the ends.
There are also many poignets bracelets which affect the nerve terminaisons fingers, they are also an axis of work with prospects.
– And you tried to deceive the brain?
To believe that it feels that it should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still behind a task on which there is still a long time the evil: how to believe in someone is physically in a very small area that it works in an open area almost endless - we are working on the concepts of carpets of race (nothing to do with those which are found in the clubs fitness), mobile platforms and also of playing giants.
For the moment, there is they-not to deceive the brain, it still leaves many years of work.
That is what makes the work on the virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: many things are still the state of absolute fertilisation.
The rule of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
'Rosbalt' continuing the project 'The vanguard Petersburg' dedicated to the citizens who are in advance, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This list ultra-sélective has already welcomed leading actors artistic Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new heroes of 'Rosbalt' is the painter extraverti Kirill Miller.
The whole city is Kirill Miller, this man rather bearded, all wearing red that we can sit around Russian Museum Garden of been or in the festive season and vernissages plugged.
The tables of Kirill Miller together always the crowds, whatever their place of exposure.
It is one of the conteurs pétersbourgeois fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance fact smile the inhabitants and putting them in good humour.
It has recently taken in its hands a culmination of Barbary and it has become the symbol of this instrument in St Petersburg since it had grown up enough for this difficult role in its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohémien.
 - Kirill, why do you read through the city whilst red and not in yellow or blue Turquoise for example?
 I chose the red as specialised in the fashion designer aspect and the image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey raises the aggression and a negative unrest.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
 – And when as-tu understood that you had to be painter?
 - At the exposure of culture Nevskiy where were my work.
I have understood that it was my way.
Then, the wave of old painters unofficial is past and the new, free, in my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to link of friendship with painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina which gave birth to 'Pouchinskaya-10' and then there has been no vague.
I am interested in the theatre, the way, music, all kinds except the words.
 – And it is in your Clinique artistic... - It was important for me to be at the centre of the culture of St Petersburg where must meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I have taken taken place to Pouchkinskaya-10 which did before the work a club musical and artistic, a club bohémien, the home of the Czech Petersburg.
Many are born: the name, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour happen with the project 'The ear of Van Gogh'.
Chnour and his friends singing songs easy in play-back in shirts moulants, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer today to the way.
When the group has started to happen to live, it has become 'Leningrad'.
Trakhtenberg little light before the time of Hali Gali.
We have given them Trakhtenberg and then its great careers began, but its training and education, it is here that it has received.
Galérie D137 ',' Club "Griboïedov ': these are the effects of the artistic Clinique.
Our employees are parties as used.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey has been organised in the press: it was the price 'The people of our city'.
I was appointed 'painter of the year, and that is when my rule ended.
This is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, we can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
 - your work is characterised by a recognisable style.
 – Many my tables are hits, they have a situation and a very strong.
I shall have a museum exhibition scheduled 'The Russian through the clowns'.
The clowns belong to a category timeless.
Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it is afraid to be as well.
But with the clowns, disappears, the tragic grave.
I love the grotesque, I have some ideas grotesque.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total nakedly and compulsory.
Today, it is the cloak which is important, it is interested in external mechanism, but not in the person.
Perhaps that we cannot give him the hand, but that we have to cough up to the tronche.
And falsehood will be wiped out by the way.
 You – Recently we have seen in the role of the high player from Barbary. - A cultural city must have this type of heroes.
Who else can play.
 - but perhaps that the art trade can also be nice?
 - Today the art trade must be treated, delicate liquoreux.
A disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, people were divided in herds, the supporters of the Czech loved one thing, the dumb another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communautés, it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a ticket 100 dollars to please everyone.
Today, we must think about which you're going liking.
Star every 100 fans.
 - but many thousands of people come see Stas Mikhaïlov!
 - This are people that we have thrown who come to see, this is the social side and that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people come, 10 miles will not come and ultimately this is less of management, money, either.
I have my fans, the main it is not to deceive them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I peignais tables a collectionneur has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables which usually are those that are painted in the end of life.
Today, we often confuses the ideas.
We said: there is the spiritual culture, the consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday I grew up with the example of painters living in poverty and die in poverty and who refused the money for precisely the paint.
I am for this culture.
 - Kirill, that is missing in St Petersburg?
 – From good experts.
There is this concept: the official culture.
But all cannot work in culture.
Under the rule of good Tsars, this was not like that, the Tsars do not understand the culture, but they understood that we should retain the good experts.
In Moscow, today there are good consultants.
We have people here in St Petersburg which could be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts to assess properly these experts and their fraieront a path.
Currently, this is the 'rule of taste' which is rife.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense that they say honestly that they do not take any contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
 - To you, what is that St Petersburg?
 - St Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there has to Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones, the art is hard to grow.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers that readers, that is bad.
In Europe, there is a curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
Here, this is very thin layer.
We must make the art in the way as was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the purse of St Petersburg
Giving birth in the area
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or asteroid collision with a murderer.
Of caravans of space shuttles with people on board go in search of a planet.
To save humanity, a large question arises: how can we continue to live our species in perfect weightlessness or on a planet of aid?
I believe that it is not much choice.
There are two real planets that we can win, if only by hypothesis.
'It is Venus and Mars', is Vladimir muted, researcher of the Institute astronomical of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars conditions are more suitable for life, surface temperature Venus is 500.
We cannot live there in the very high or on the orbit of Venus... in the area.
We began to take an interest in matters of reproduction in the area by focusing on flora.
There is still half a century, we carried out experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown into orbit différenciaient is in no way of real estate markets varieties.
Secondly, it has put into orbit of insects, small flies drosophiles breeding.
In 1979, eggs of quail were sent in the area to see how an embryo weightlessness.
It gets to the exit poussin a perfectly normal.
It is then that the problems begin.
'The problem is linked to the fact that the poussin must find a medium, there must be put on its feet and start to move', explains the Director of the laboratory of the Institute problems médico-biologiques the Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By no means, chicks are agitaient disorderly.
And after 10 p.m., the new born saw their instincts entirely atrophy.
The chicks do not react in the light or her.
Unfortunately, they were dying simply after quattre days.
'We have écarquillé me twice, then we have abandoned, because it is simply impossible to work with them there', explains Vladimir Sychev confirming the failure of the experience with the chicks in the area.
The last 'organic' miniature arch with animals has been sent into orbit there are 16 years.
The experience will continue in the spring 2013.
However, the 'biosatellite Bion' will not of species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their foetuses in the area.
In principle, we have discovered nothing surnaturel.
'It was still biosatellites and this is the only experience. It must carry out this type of research', remarked Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, rats of the area have given birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly in the area.
This is no trifling matter.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instinct.
Unlike the animals, the man is able, in principle.
The Homo sapiens has the abstract thinking, it is capable of creating a proper emotional.
This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
But women are going in the space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is that humanity has more valuable.
Our mouette has disappeared and person on earth could not say whether it would take after a flight in the area.
If it could give birth to a child after the flight.
'Nobody responded to this issue', explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a pensioner of the sector of rockets and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight in the area, the first woman cosmonaute Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaïev was also cosmonaute.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice into orbit and have even worked in middle extra-véhiculaire, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have little, even very little cosmonaut which had nothing and that give rise to a descent into full health after long flights.
'And if they are more long, this presents a risk even during flights in orbit', concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the hero of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity should seek new solutions in biotechnology, the protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Laboratory hydrology of the Centre of preparation of a cosmonaut: binding stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in flottabilité cosmonaut is zero, the lead to the exits extra-véhiculaires.
Water emulating the perfect weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreigner, for infants, it is their real element.
Small men amphibious seem to confirm: life on earth is the ocean.
Insofar as the baby is moving around nine months in the cash lymphatique's belly of his mother, it is easier to get used to water.
It is logical in principle, since its birth until its first round, there is only 2 weeks.
'It is very little to forget, explains the instructor swimmer for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child just born the perfect weightlessness is a state more natural, the woman needs of gravity, a force weight.
In the womb, muscles, basin is atrophient very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Good agreement, ignore it on the basis of simulators childbirth.
Of course you can prepare a birth in a special chamber, the woman will bring it out.
'And then?' request Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the attraction land, the body does not form the skeleton neither the muscle system.
We cannot pay an infant as an adult with a combination for the special training.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
'And this experience that we will have to consider in this case in imagining the birth of a child in an environment will lead to the return on Earth of a disabled child, entirely désadapté', provides for the Director of the Committee on bioethics médico-biologiques problems of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in the area is still theory.
However, with the time it will become reality, when the US will be in their commuting to a distant planet which will become the habitat of their offspring born in the area.
The head of the Institution ISC (higher control of public finances) said: 'the control of the pseudo self-employment (Czech' system Švarc ') failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has inspectors competent and high-quality legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.
That is what was said Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Institution greater control of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
'The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking at home', said in his comment Kala of the current situation.
A control carried out jointly by inspectors Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.
He mentions as an example of abusive practice the approach of 'Švarc system' by Petr Nečas.
Prime Minister recently said that the ODS not going to upset the entrepreneurs with controls; it is permitted or forbidden?
'The law must be applied in a way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority to act to inspect to demand respect for the law', note Kala.
At the meeting of the monitoring committee to the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco-allemand in which have been compared with the laws in public procurement of these two countries.
What was in practice?
It is a parallel control that we have launched about two years.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and special national legislation and practice itself to follow.
We have gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences we have arisen: generally speaking, our legislation is perhaps more severe and 'better', however, according to certain parameters, as such is best practice in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to draw up rules are constantly increasingly detailed but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law.
What this project can help you specifically and résulte-t-il for you?
A joint monitoring of this kind should contribute to this that we stopped we try to clarify the laws, to fall and to improve the thresholds, when this has not a truly positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtain the thing in question to a reasonable cost (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the thresholds of markets, you will not necessarily this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape, that those who seek loopholes will be much more opportunities than if the threshold was remained highest.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a form of organization different?
As regards the institutions, similarly to the works there the Bundesrechnungshof ISC, which is organised similairement, it also has a board been a bit differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally in a similar manner.
The competences are also, in a certain extent, similar, with a nuance, however, with our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has therefore also of Auditors of this kind at the level of individual Länder.
The BRH can only monitor the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of Auditors of the Länder.
As regards the national legislation, is simpler than ours?
I do not wish to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often seen as a model but we cannot say that it is better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have data comparison.
However, we must also say that this country that we regard as a model is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, not?
As regards the national legislation, that has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the public procurement law, its effects are already visible?
This amendment being entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet impact on our control operations.
As we are doing a posteriori inspections, it is with some delay.
Our comments relate to, for the moment, the process of preparation of the future controls - we have launched a new instrument of 'detection of risks of bad management' with which we have watched almost 14 000 public procurement - that these changes will of course, because the thresholds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm this.
The problem that can arise is that these rules are becoming more severe and that it is not possible to respect them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (for example the Regional Council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) recruited the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to tackle the system or abuse but not punish those who commit of formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
Such a system will increase pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to cope?
Look at where we will not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS not going to upset the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does this mean?
The system Švarc is banned or authorised?
The law must be applied in a way or another, even if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent a authority to act to inspect and demand respect for the law.
It can say: 'We are going to change the law and allow', but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The law on the markets has rules fairly strict on the formalities to do and this, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But furthermore, it is tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and is, in my opinion, what is lacking at home.
Roads are in places frozen, but most workable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also covered in snow.
The network remains, however, most practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were this morning workable, but by places frozen and also covered in snow.
Temperatures have fallen and fluctuates between -5 ° and 10 ° C but they should go slightly in the day.
The snow ceased in the region and it is in the lowlands that a thin layer of snow.
The Erz crêtes of Monts (Krušné Hory), however, are covered by approximately 30 centimetres of snow.
It is regional data of the service of maintenance of roads that, in the fog, the visibility was reduced by places.
The fast track R6 and the national roads of the region are now feasible without difficulties.
Vigilance, however, is, for example on some bridges that road can be frozen and ice.
All roads minor routes and the third category, including the roads of mountain, are also feasible.
There is still on some of their sections of the remains of snow frozen and places tassée by traffic.
Especially in areas as altitude, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Pardubice regions and of Hradec Králové
The Directorate-General for roads and motorways reports on its Web site that certain roads of Bohemia to the east are threatened by the training of ice and snow sections tassées by traffic can be found on the roads in mountain areas and in altitude.
The maintenance of roads warn drivers against the risks of training of ice in the areas of the region of Pardubice located in altitude.
There can be of the ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on the roads of the French departments and third category.
Roads 1 / 43 and 1 / 34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Monts the eagle (Orlické Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a snow cover tassée by traffic is present on the roads in the areas in altitude.
Bohemia of the East, the time will be today dry, the more often reached, with any passages overcast times.
It will be a wind and generally low temperatures will vary between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen region
The roads of the region of Pilsen today are workable, although, in some places, it must be vigilant and to adjust to weather conditions.
This morning, it is freezing temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the recent snow and cooling that followed, certain channels of communication can be places frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross the areas of fog, visibility will improve however gradually.
That is what it is information service regional maintenance of roads.
The motorway D5 is practicable almost without difficulties, the maintenance of communications, however, a road recommend vigilance between the 80 kilometres and 131.
The causes of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The third category are minor and wet and in this case applies the warning against the sections frozen.
Drivers must be vigilant, and it particularly on the roads less crowded of the region of the Šumava National Park.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers travelling in the areas of the region of Olomouc located in altitude must now count with a thick layer of snow and soft on the roads.
That has remained on the Brenner Pass said 'Červenohorské sedlo' and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the operations of chemical processing.
The snow have forced this night the staff of maintenance of roads to go on the ground; according to the services in charge of the roads, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most surfaces are feasible without difficulties.
'On the heights of the district of Šumperk are the remnants of snow.
Drivers operating in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet the said 'Červenohorské sedlo' a thick layer of snow and soft 'said today in ČTK the leader of the maintenance of roads district Šumperk.
Their colleagues in the district of Jeseník also went on place during the night; according to recent, after the chemical treatment, roads, are now identified and mouillées, even in the areas of the highest level.
In the district of Olomouc roads are feasible without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should however be careful in the sections in forest areas to wet surfaces remained.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, the maintenance of roads in Northern Bohemia have pointed out several sections difficult.
It is of the data of the police that, in addition to certain areas covered in snow and ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in more low altitude, and therefore the snow and ice should stay on the roads. In the lowlands, particularly in the South is of Plateau Central Bohemia, there has, on the contrary, no problem and roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement has been pointed out at the moment.
The maintenance of roads have pointed out the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to the meteorologists night, the conditions were ideal to its training: rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freeze during the night.
It also points out, since the main axes of movement, difficult conditions on the route 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have courbées under the weight of snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: 'In together, we want to collect the positive energy'.
What do you think the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world?
This is only one of these alarming news, the kind of trap in which we love fall.
In our group The TAP TAP, rigole rather, be said that we are the only group able to collect a rest of positive energy in order to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, you go up in December a project is unique: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you offer in more detail this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we are preparing for two years.
We have decided to use the potential marketing of the end of the timetable Mayan announced for the 21 December at 11 p.m. 10 of the morning.
The eve, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, Prague, and from someone from Ostrawa Brno.
They will virtually at a time when will end the Mayan timetable on the island of Kiribati which is in the ocean, on a peaceful time zone in advance of 12 hours a report to us.
Who has had this idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we have designed with our Creator, Augusta Honza.
Outside the fact that we want to collect sufficient positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, reflect the state of the world that we leave our children.
At the end of the timetable Mayan, we have created a unique collection of objects, in particular T-shirts, shoes, bags, and key original against the end of the world, in the buying online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The TAP TAP with other interpreters has also seen an anthem against the end of the world who is entitled 'Ending world cancelled' (in Czech 'Konec světa zrušeno').
It is already very popular on YouTube, the entendra-t-on during these concerts charitable?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not place...
It will be chantée simultaneously by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Anthems are also to join a given moment in the framework of a direct entirely unique, the Czech television.
The words of this song have been written by Tomáš Hanák which also takes the main role of Jesus in the sound bite, Xindl X is please also...
How are you prepared to cooperate with them?
We are working with other figures from the Czech show-biz, because we have many events and charitable concerts...
We are trying to get them intensively to these projects.
It transpired that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amused.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we are working to the achievement in the framework of the Institute Jedlička, with the association TAP, and that for six years.
Teachers are regularly to the pupils of the Institute Jedličkův and propose that the activities of interest and enjoy.
The students themselves do not have the means to attend courses, we are trying to help them in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the construction of the Institute Jedlička, we will transfer this project in a new building independent.
Several groups of music and interpreters will rise on a stage at each of these expectations?
According to what criteria, have you the chosen?
We have tried to draw up a programme addressing all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, get on stage Chinaski, Support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Preparing also to other "mega events' of this kind in the future?
In May, we shall play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here too, we will prepare a programme with guests interesting.
We should also play next year in the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and in Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal, so far you have played by example in Madrid, London, Brussels and Moscow.
The TAP TAP is nevertheless a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organisation and logistics of your eye?
This is not so terrible that it looks at first sight.
We have five Members in which the electric chair gear must travel by bunker trimbalons, of course we also many boxes of luggage and instruments.
So here is always more or less well past, and British Airways ČSA were always fully prepared for us, they have surprised more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of public opinion toward the disabled and so on.
What was your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better that we have just witnessed in Moscow that is all is only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people; there, it is not yet know that a person moves only in electric chair in the city centre.
They do not yet see it as self-evident to give priority to a person in seat in the lifts.
Fortunately there, too, an association trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled people is being created.
What do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still lagging behind...
It is important to mention that the improvements and refinements are still dependent on the efforts made by the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a severe handicap move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very often there that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The TAP TAP, are rather the contrary to the forefront of progress!
The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really begin to change when we have among us of sportspeople, artists and actors, politicians or the famous jurists.
For the moment, they are isolated cases of people who have a strong desire.
The group The TAP TAP is currently very popular, reverting back to a few years, what you pushed in 1998 to create this group?
I have started to work as an educator to the Institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And as I myself am musician (I plays, among others, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created an activity music.
And then, with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, a little lost control of the situation (laughter).
The success that has happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
It is true, creating links with singers known and to work actively to the promotion of the Group has helped us.
We understood that, if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the substance.
Thanks to the European Union subsidies, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality of teachers, equipment, and so on.
You aim to achieve such a level with The TAP TAP?
From the outset, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things which copy from each other.
In a way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it takes a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say that TAP TAP is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time, of course, is the pity, it is natural...
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned of all, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a full life and flourish, provided that the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.
Is it that your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you have described by many people?
If we want to do the work of quality, we must be firm in many areas and demand a degree of discipline.
But I think it is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realise that they must come to repeats twice per week, follow the preparatory and spend much time on the roads for concerts, they will lose their enthusiasm.
But it works in the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve the objectives.
The group The TAP TAP are currently twenty members.
How many of them were already present in 1998?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open-ended Group, people come and go, we can do nothing.
Our doors are still open to those who want to or might wish to join us.
It will be the case the eve of the day to the end of the world, on Thursday 20 December 2012 from 9 a.m.
This action will be held in Prague in the arena Incheba, Brno to Fléda and from someone from Ostrawa in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other players Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected with audiovisual when will relay chantée jointly the song of the group The TAP TAP 'Ending world cancelled'.
The aim is to bring together the financial resources (to EUR 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo in Prague in the institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to this together is 400 CZK, entry is free for children up to 12 years, the pre-sale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland has been recognised as twentieth Member of this agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic has become a fully-fledged Member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun a close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the years that followed has participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
The road of Poland into space, however, has started much sooner.
Before the Second World War, Poles passionate worked on space flights; they had not always understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the Conference of A. Šternfeld in the Observatory astronomical Warsaw, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his book of vanguard entitled 'Introduction to aeronautics'.
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left auditors cold and years later Šternfeld is rappela that only the doctor Jan Gadomski is doubling its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld got in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book 'Introduction to aeronautics'.
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a great propagateur of Astronomy and aeronautics.
It issued hundreds of articles in the newspapers Polish and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagateur of aeronautics of world renown, his contribution has been particularly rewarded by the fact that his name has been given a cratères of the hidden face of the moon.
In 1925 was built in Poland a draisine intended to be equipped with a rocket engine.
It is unfortunately not the author and the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket should serve to propel or curb the draisine.
The only known about this draisine are those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote itself to the rockets.
The research were conducted by the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with teachers and Gustaw Mieczyslaw Wolfke Mokrzyckiego.
It is of the documents held that this research had reached the stage of trials.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armed, research is are interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of hunting a rocket photoélectrique, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, emerged in the press and the following year was published the book 'Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna I rakietobomba lotnicza' of an author so-called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had intended to military use of the engines of rockets.
Just before the war, all the projects to use of the technique of rockets were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ('Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy coordinated'), which all the work.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautics society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is question of a society in the number of November 1954 of the newspaper problem, in which there are four more detailed articles for aviation.
In one of these articles, by Professor Mr Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to aeronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had of the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the Polish astronautics society (PTA) déploya efforts to enter the Federation international astronautics (created in 1951) and from the autumn, the regular PTA in became a Member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the Federation astronautics international.
It conserva its function until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket Meteorological RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch held on 10 October 1958.
This rocket a range of 1 800 metres was a length of 80 cm and a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, was built an improved version RM-1A and, during the summer 1959, test flights of the two-tier rocket RM-2 were initiated in the desert Bledov.
This was a rocket length of 1.4 metre and probably 11.5 kg.
The prototype following should be able to make concrete scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should be made up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the altitude.
But in 1963, all the work of development were halted.
The rocket Meteor-1 development during the period 1962 - 1965 was followed the first type of rockets RM.
This rocket, designed with two storeys, had a total length 510 cm weight and an initial 32.5 kg.
Three models (so-called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were notable for the dimensions of the space for the scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had an area with a volume of 0.4 litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this amount was to 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum scope to all these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the rockets Meteor-2 were developed in the aeronautical Institute, the first trials of flight began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a burden useful to 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently were built the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It is important to mention the entry of Poland in COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
In the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in space exploration on the Soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Mr Remek, the second cosmonaute non-soviétique of this programme.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court has annulled the law on the work of public utility.
This decision has raised in the public a heated discussion.
It is certainly interesting to examine this issue of a broader perspective.
The economic systems geared towards liberalism, both in the EU in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of economic competition unregulated.
This means that economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and the free movement without limits) of private capital ally unbridled financial speculation.
The significant differences in the price of work (wages) generate tension on prices.
It should be put under this term the significance: a producer is striving for the import of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in 'making it more expensive' the price of competitor, in order to remove a greater share of the market and increase its own profits.
Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy low prices, or disappear. The result is a high unemployment in the countries where the price of work are high in comparison with other economies.
Given that the private capital has no responsibility of the social point of view and thereby responsibility vis-à-vis the unemployment that it generates, the social costs of the State necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifying the perfect unwillingness of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is such a point well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital in the various economies create a situation in which the governments of individual countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, the governments put their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking account of the social collapse.
This manifests itself mainly in the amendments of the laws in force.
The aim is to compel economically its own people to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is happening on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
It is a growing poverty and the deepening of the differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there is for years of the points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already by million the number of these people.
In the framework of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees receive such wages that the State is forced to pay extra for they reach the bare minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliary the Federal Parliament.
The economy measures of practically all the Member States of the south of the EU generate, without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century), or just stumble along with starvation wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.
We must ask ourselves the following question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty go from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media say, to get tired, that the state cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that the planned economy led to an economic disaster.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy by means of regulatory intervention.
We must then ask ourselves whether the private capital does not influence and, even, is not today, according to its own selfish interests, the policy and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this issue is certainly yes.
The proof is that there is a lobby virtually omnipotent and present in all Member States.
It is a desperate situation is demonstrating in the area of corruption, by granting reciprocal benefits, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such, because of the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of projects of laws to firms closely linked to the industry.
These projects of law are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The whole of power is not the people, such as the State Constitutions of Western, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that democracies geared towards liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled 'the crisis of the Roman Empire during Caesar and Pompée': 'The State was long in full decline and functions were allocated by violence.
The blows of bribes, favors obtained illegally, and the Stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The buildings and corruption has collapsed without limits and the people were the elections with voices already sold '......' The people honest does not seek to obtain functions, the result was once the State were 8 months without consuls'... 'It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that we should choose a man energetic'... It is true that Appianos Pompée had in mind, but it is Caesar which has changed irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, the private capital is no longer capable of understanding and to assert the interests of society as a whole.
As a result, today, as a decadence without prior elites, without any effort to carry out reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation of unscrupulous economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, we can see the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies such as a sort of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites completely ignoring the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, the humanitarian and social crises which we are today witnesses and crimes against humanity, such as we know from history and recent.
The repeal of the law on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure of economic competition, both internationally that the European internal level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution lies in the socio-political for reforms, which will increase investment in capital of the State in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society in favour of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
'There will never of violence and never can' declare Sting in song entitled fragile to which the main the refrain is' let us not forget how we are fragile '.
'If my son did not want war, there would not have', said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions were high.
Some take the Party of Israel, its right to self-defence and the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, other support the Palestinians, invoking racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and recital Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is a victim, in its waves of killings recurrent; after all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer to the readers a point of view located 'behind the iron curtain', on the one to which mainly benefits the tensions which already exist for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small country in the Middle East.
Some of these thoughts are based on historical facts available to the study, others from my own understanding of, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily the history of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or if they were to their actions to the throne to someone who ran their actions previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration creating certain powers was not to be at a single generation.
The families with a huge wealth is particularly the family Rothschild, which could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude).
Little is written on them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s the nineteenth century, they have acquired the first World (Reuters news agency) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their behalf and serious criminal acts which they were involved and who had always meant for a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major holdings in almost most central banks of the world and preparing or lead wars against countries in which they have not yet such participations (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq to 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian Government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America of Rothschild the status of Central Bank and began to make during the civil war its own money (government, I hear) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to make money own and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, Mr Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 then that he wanted to initiate proceedings against the EDF for provoking the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at global level has resulted in the years, 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a a initiated in the 33rd degree, as the highest level.
The first war was intended to eliminate the large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate the British colonialism, in particular, and the third should reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such an amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (the œcuménisme is nothing other than the beginnings of such a solution) and, ultimately, acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the richest families with their heads the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent that are not repeated crises like those that they began in 1907).
Having managed to trigger the First World War by the murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand Habsburg Austro-Hungarian to the throne, destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War is perhaps a capitulation by German economic and military without justification (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of Czarist Russia), and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For a start easier to the Second World War, bankers have left the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: they have imposed on the one hand, Germany non-traceability war reparations and creates the conditions for a radicalisation of the impoverished masses (then it is enough to put a leader sufficiently forceful, showing the finger of blame, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia comprised of different nationalities, including a strong German minority which should play the role that it was indeed) (fifth column to put the hornets ’ nest and a war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspira to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundations of a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the initial friction with the local population Arab began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to assess if Hitler has broken the channels in which international bankers the had initially; or whether everything he has done was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Jews in Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations for the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially based in 1948, the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were to the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel has sparked a hotbed of fire which could cause a third world war.
If international bankers manage to war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of fighting, this time of the population generally Arab or Muslim the Middle East.
Israel is as a huge laboratory, the source of contention and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (it is enough to see how people fall hard between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where a wrong creates another wrong according to a circle of violence and where there are, to the origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power on the world?
We must make the difference between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as home, international bankers did not propose to the people in the elections that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of politician fascisant, loyal vis-à-vis international bankers, which is all to start a war with Iran, which could, because this country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran control the Strait of Hormuz, by which passes 20% of all the world oil (this corridor Shipyard has a breadth of 2 miles) and create a destruction of the global economy.
Under what light now appear to the comments made by David Rockefeller in 1994: 'The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order. "
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which any new born is located at birth an electronic chip making him a be completely controlled.
'What they compel all individuals, large and small, rich and poor, free and slaves to bear on the one hand or the front on red railways, so that it can or buy or sell those who do not bear the name of this fierce stupid or the number of its behalf.
We must understand: that of common sense into account the figures of this stupid fierce.
This number is the man and it is six hundred and sixty six '.
The film ARGO: when all is worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a host of demonstrators composed of Islamist students took to attack the US Embassy in Tehran and retint hostage 52 diplomats.
They should be released in exchange for, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, which, after the Revolution, had fled to the United States, who supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer to the US administration to positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was able to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a blow for the prestige of the United States, even worse later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
Diplomats kidnapped were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the Algerian Government.
Their fate inspired the United States with a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan the presidential elections in 1980.
The ARGO, the film actor and orchestrator Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this history that a small victory in America.
Just before it is occupied, six employees are fleeing from the embassy.
After many vicissitudes complicated, they found themselves in the arrest of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to bring them out of Iran with a bizarre coverage: they fled the country with passports Canadian as a team of film come to repérages for the film of a film show of science fiction.
Gender combination
The plan of the expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez requit the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialist magasines did state of this project film, presses conferences were held and a society of shadow production was real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film of Affleck unusual is a combination of various kinds.
It is a part of a thriller policy designed realistic but also a 'caper movie', the story of a coup, a treachery - as, for example, in the trialogue is Ocean' Eleven store, and twelve Thirteen.
The ambiances place: sequences of Tehran of style (in the documentary subtitled sequences are presented photographs iconiques of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these pictures, these situations have been recorded in the film, there is no major differences),
Some passages more light of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes of the CIA headquarters and other institutions with men costumés discussing the situation around tables conference in the corridors and the telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to get his career.
Derided player, it became a orchestrator respected player and its game has ceased to elicit ironic comments.
ARGO is its third long-métrage after the dark policing 'Gone Baby Gone' (2007) and the thriller 'The town' (2010).
It is also the first to film Affleck which is not taking place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics which put its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also proof of this sense of the atmosphere in ARGO where the role of Tehran 'is held' with Canada.
The best scenes of the film are taking place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real facts; the original sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, in a place, has written a page of history.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the scenes fictitious (the false camera crew in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too many actions to too many places
The orchestrator had simply a matter is in fact that few scenes exciting film, in the sense of the term.
It is doing very well, it adds sometimes certain elements to the reality and the result is not always equally elegant (stage in which the threat of crisis at the airport in Tehran is ruled out by a telephone call in America and continuing on the runway are rather far-fetched).
The weakness of ARGO lies in its character dissipated, due to the need to be too of events in too many places.
It is true that Alan John Goodman Arkin and are completely charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters would have deserved greater prominence and these are not far from it, the only in this case.
The film of Affleck lack a little of tension dramatic, it is a moderate interest in appreciating the achievement and the retro style of the 1970s.
It leads to the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story again, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscients, it is the case.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which leads every year a public inquiry on the bank charges the more absurd, has now decided to launch the help of the Rules of Procedure or ideas from the 'workshop EU the most absurd.
'The fact that the EU is, recently, adopt a quota of 40% of women for the direction of European big business has been at the root of our decision,' said for the newspaper Právo the organiser of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the nonsense mentioned, there has already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women were an advantage in terms of tariffs on the life insurance because they are, objectively, a risk to the insurance companies.
People can point out until the end of the year any other idea incredible of the 'EU workshop'.
'The vote will take place before the end of February 2013', has informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add fuel organic components, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of mercury thermometers reliable only because they contain a relatively low a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of conventional battery hens, which has led to the increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been made in the past against the ban on use of the expression 'butter to chocolate spreads' or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas of quality must be a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration reacts often under pressure from a commercial and industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of States (and the Czech Republic is currently the demands of its banks in threatening to use its veto).
The interests of lobbies are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that in the Union, bananas must not be of a size less than 14 cm or present a 'bendy abnormal'.
The European Commission has defended in arguing that it was not doing that harmonising national standards not homogenous which complicate the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite the opposition of some Member States, claiming that the existing directives entail a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this EU regulation of last year that should be on the balls gonflables a warning that the children of less than eight years should not inflate without monitoring of adults.
The EU has made reference to a US inquiry that the balls are among the toys, the first cause of death of children by choking.
A restriction similar applies to children under 14 years in terms of trumpets blowing in curiosities.
Here too, we have ideas bizarre.
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name 'Macedonia' and must, instead, talk of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the 'applicant' Let Make of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the regulation of the Union on the size of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for the reserves of food products that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic dépassa secondly, for example, the volume set for the mushrooms canned and risqua, this fact, a heavy fine.
The organisers of this investigation have seen interesting idea to pay money to certain countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea to grant a subsidy to ask the granting of subsidies.
These ideas are not, however, from Brussels but in Prague.
'The not having sea we handicaps.
We are going to ask the European Union a refund '. This is expressed, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It argues that, the fact of our production of cereals, and following the so-called 'purchases interventionist', the state of stocks was found with full that it had then export.
According to Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and involving a tender for the purchase of wheat from the maritime country.
Subsidies for obtaining subsidies have been proposed by the Ministry of the common Development led by the local Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to draw up the demands of subsidies by Brussels.
The EU says: 'the bizarre regulations are rare'.
If the regulations are often criticised in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts made by the EU regulatory and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union and in the area of its development rather general, deserve praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects which have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, as other EU countries, fighting to Brussels for the right to use of specific names to these traditional products (fight that it does not always winner) arouses strong emotions amongst the Czechs.
If the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', for which the name of 'Tuzemský Rum' which dates back home in the nineteenth century, our producers have had to replace it by the name 'Tuzemák'.
Only products from sugar cane alcohol, and not of sugar beet, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of products registered of the EU is today with world-renowned as feta cheese or gorgonzola, the massepain in Lübeck or of Parma ham, biscuits of Karlovy Vary (the 'Karlovarské suchary'), the carpes of Pohořelice and Třeboň ('Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr') and hops of Žatec ('Žatecký chmel').
Bread of épice of Pardubice ('Pardubický perník') and the cake called 'Cornets of Hořice' ('hořické trubičky') can also be proud of their Community mark.
People want I saves the Republic, but I am merely an amateur, declares itself Senator Okamura
Mr Senator, how has the idea to present the presidential elections?
This is not to be Senator or president who account for me.
If all worked without problems in our country, I would candidate nowhere.
But I do more to see as the country is plundered since the last 20 years that thieves are not in bars and taxes and the age of retirement increase.
I did not have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that does not please me, then I am trying to provide a solution for change.
And as I have more than forty years and that independent, I am a member of any party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that I present the presidential elections or Senate.
You entered in the Senate but you have put quickly for the Castle (n.d.t.: seat of the Presidency).
Do you do not turn our backs on those who elected you?
I have always said that I am sending in the battle for the Castle according to the results of senatorial elections
Subsequently, I have said that if I was elected Senator, I shall be presenting the presidential elections.
My aim is not the function, it is merely an instrument which will allow me to make my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and mandate of the broader.
The problem is not only as a nation we râlons in the bar or to our television, but it is also that we are stalling all those who are trying to make the change.
In addition to the press which destroys the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech and freedom of lying.
It has, for example, said in my remarks that I soudoie journalists or that I have been the advisor Jiří Paroubek.
Turning to your visions.
You began the fight for the Castle as a battle with the issues of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive of tax returns than 20 million CZK].
You must change the law to this end.
As President, you do not have such a power and only the Senate in a whole can propose legislation.
How do you intend to resolve this problem?
When as a citizen, I have pushed for the activities of tourist guides are a liberal profession, I have won.
The problem is the politicaillerie: when someone comes from the left or right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it is delaying the citizens.
As independent, a member of any party, I have a lot more opportunities to obtain the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorisation and dogma supporters, take every party what is best for our country and implement it.
You consider rather as a man of right or left?
A Czech point of view, I have the impression that people have left me rather.
For me, that this is a little Left or Right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me, this is not that people are right-wing or left-wing but to unite people.
I still support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I am acting as impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enragez when someone said to you that you are a populist?
But what you said the prouve-t-il not?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also a certain aim optimal and a vision.
You are trying to bring.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals which I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without the support of Parliament, you have that slogans.
You do not survivrez long with this policy.
Do you think that if you will see people and their speak, you will succeed, for example, to impose the material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince the politicians, journalists and public opinion and to endorse my side in order to impose it.
If I was elected President, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality which will identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of President by direct suffrage, it has been achieved thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, clearly, be an amateur, and not a genius or an intellectual.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have to engage in politics and I am trying to get majority support for my programme.
I am trying, alone, to make things, and if it does not work, I will end in six years and I will return in the private sector.
It is as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make the difference is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present itself as the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but it has refused due to the amount of work.
I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed fraud with oil.
I have presented, because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of people have not voted and what did have, for most, given their voice to a representative of the establishment.
The Senate, we are only two independent.
People have elected a Senate, which will be difficult to impose changes.
Despite everything, I will fight for my view, for example the election by direct suffrage mayors and of prefects of regions.
Do you intend to base your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check whether the past of each Member potential is clean and then I do not have the financial resources.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand on board 'transparent'.
You did not money?
You talk about tax declarations, what is yours?
I believe, around 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have in Prague a ground to a value of 25 million, an apartment a value of 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art of a value of approximately 10 million, a Aston Martin, which is 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have a Aston Martin, because it was a dream boy: I have always loved James Bond, which were in car, was galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse.
You drive your Aston Martin, you have a heritage of a value of 60 million and you did not money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for this campaign.
I should nevertheless me?
I have already invested 2 and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my programme does not generate a great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My expenses of campaign are broadly covered by the remuneration that I receive as a senator.
But I could not live on, for example pay school English my son which costs 30 000 per month.
If my only objective was to earn money, I will present in any election.
You will therefore continue your business activities to be able to live?
Did you said that you mettriez your activities muted?
But this is not linked to the amount that remuneration.
As I promised, I have partly reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency.
People want I am a samaritain which saves the Republic.
Nevertheless, we must be something that I live.
What was your monthly salary usual when you were entrepreneur?
I gagnais and I still earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was President, I would end to my business activities.
You will find this interview in publishing of Saturday of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the cabinet MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not just imagination. If we look to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos
'I think that this building is marrant, it is very much futuristic, finally something interesting to see', we said Lisette Verhaig, enhancing on the slow lane the streets.
Stefan Spermon, a computer programmer in a large company neighbour, we said: 'Yes, it is indeed very well, this building'.
But I wonder why we need yet today a library.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and of e-books.
Now, nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries elderly, not?
Spijkenisse, a ville-dortoir which has nothing to attractive the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The common 80,000 souls employment-creation rate of education the weakest of the Netherlands.
To restore some neurons the brains, the city has decided, a few years, to contribute to the general culture and replicate the seven bridges shadow on the EUR tickets in the form of cute toy small armed painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained restricted.
That is how the authorities of the city have realised that there was only one way to resume the statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the office of architects of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrams in bold and sticks creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with its usual stiff upper lips and the competition was in 2003 with five books in the arm and a knowing sneer on the face.
And while the Members of the jury is still watching, confused and shrugging our shoulders, Maas, the brazen, empila its books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and perhaps his speech by arguments activists by a common: 'dear!'
It is my proposal for the mountain of pounds of Spijkenisse, or as we said, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has bounced.
The edifice is part of a project of revitalisation with also an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and some buildings and houses mitoyennes for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books has received the second price 'Best Library of NL 2012'.
Moreover, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is how this small village dull, which until today had nothing more to offer a post-modern piétonne area and a staggering laideur mayoralty of a white the facades, which call for thinking that they contain a dairy, has been enriched of a contemporary architectural.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural of its history.
The long road to the reading
First impression, El Dorado of the book under glass to cheese.
Admittedly, a lift you transports at the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture is open to you when you are trampling the soil of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The glass is entirely of light and clear, soil brick Dutch and streetlights elegant unequivocal speak the language of municipal public places.
Urban the atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking at the benches, dogs and boys and girls who play the ball.
Everywhere, and books, books and books.
'Normally, the library shelves are along the façade and the environment is a room great and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal', explains Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the classic space configuration and open spaces of reading of the Interior to the outside world.
The mountain of books has been skilfully developed: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the Club of failures, the Centre for the environment and the technical building.
A particular beauty lies in the black the library shelves, which are sometimes of lambris, sometimes of balustrades, sometimes ramps stairs.
A new experience for the view, the reach and the odorat.
Even the architects and engineers hardened do not want the building materials unknown.
'We want to work with of recycled materials', explains Joop Trouborst, leader of the project to the common Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
It is thus that one day we have found in one agricultural business Friesian an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
The Netherlands, used for the years of the synthetic membrane one millimetre thick as substrate in the greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and it is gaining time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then we can build.
For the library, the membrane has been steamrollered, for the first time in such quantities, sclerosis four centimetres thick.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the 'Landbouwplastic' (KPL) changes colour and turn into a dark material, consistent and resistant, including the smell is both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 metres, coffee literary offers us an impregnable view on the city, but also of the Dutch and croquettes ficus in bribes.
They create an atmosphere, but above all, contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture content of the air of the mountain literary.
Donations to the soul new
'It is incredible, but despite all the areas of glass, this building is a model project green', entrusts Trouborst.
The temperature of the structure is regulated by geothermal power.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass of glass, the sun it illuminates little time, even the days of the time.
The thick wooden beams of means in relation to the façade of used glass pare-soleil, listening to a large part of the shelves.
The prevailing atmosphere is very pleasant.
The blinds fully automated can do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the computer programmer septique aforementioned has already risky to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, described the Boekenberg as the 'soul finally found' of Spijkenisse.
There are a few weeks indeed, at the inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This allowed to fill the gaps in the library which was not yet completely garnie (today, it intends 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are full of all sides.
For the architect Winy Maas, 'there is nothing worse than a library half empty.'
'I believe that our invitation has created some relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if only for the decoration. '
That is how MVRDV has reached the main discipline so-called, in the jargon professional, 'the creation of an identity'.
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Although it may seem young and educated.
It is a new starting point for the creation of an identity.
Szabo: 'the Germans must play a greater role.'
Germany has chosen to abstain from the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision is Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of the Palestinian State to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.
But it was then chosen to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany do not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without, however, be too critical of Israel.
In the uprising in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen to abstain from the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO implied this measure.
Germany finds difficult to adopt a clear position on the major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently revising its external policy, seeking to move away from a policy as defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of common and coherent policy within the Union makes the situation.
The Germans have therefore to several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.
I believe that they tâtonnent yet to find this role, but are on the road to a foreign policy 'normal'.
A foreign policy, as in France or Britain
That means in practice then the term 'normal' foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent from those of the USA and the European partners, including as regards the national affairs.
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, and therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are, in a certain extent, different to those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany to the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention of the UN vote?
Germany has first important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must take care not to offend the public, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
It is undoubtedly a decisive point.
However, I do not accorderais too important, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a key element in the German strategic considerations.
Germany nuit-elle to its relations with the United States in choosing the abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
That is why I believe that the gap is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps that Germany will be respected.
Indeed, Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as a global player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are various.
By contrast, the United States have announced their veto of a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There has always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration secretly shown great understanding for the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so large that they always seem.
If you look at relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from outflank of enthusiasm for the policy of Netanyahu.
Germany finds difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, with the position of the major European partners?
I believe that it does not make things any easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if it were a coherent European policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
They cannot therefore be in a broader political line and have to affirm their unique position.
That is what they are currently in the question of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will the future a leading role and cause Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, particularly because of our relations with Israel.
This question has always been difficult.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware that they must play a role which marks more independence.
Germany will see a role to play an important player on the international stage, Germany is only assume a key role?
Or has always difficult to play leading roles on?
Germany is still not used, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is always difficult to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that every time that Germany decides to carry more weight, many feelings antiallemands.
It does not make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: they do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
This point of view, Germany is in a far worse position than the United States.
It must deal with neighbours and opinions very varied, and this is not easy.
Today, the United States' influence on European policy is decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this gap, which remains?
The Germans will merely play a more important role.
And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant and if they are less appreciated, it is life.

'Protection of trademarks' in China: when Puma Armani and suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are the well-known makes throughout the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The mark and enjoys protection such as the company which bears the name cannot complain.
And even if it could, it is not sure that it would be successful.
'It is increasingly difficult for outsiders to protect their brands in China', explains Thomas Pattloch, Taylor Wessing cabinet lawyer specialising in violation of property law in the Far East.
Every week, a new dossier is in my office.
The copycats only need of a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we are seeing Lu-Gucci, and instead of Wears Prada – there is Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the manufacturer of articles of sport.
Pattloch opens a good in which are the registrations carried out with the trademarks agency of Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has tabled the marks Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company has artificially created in appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the home of fashion.
This is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and the violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, shopping centres on several floors which sell almost that counterfeit.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its clients the responsibility to tackle the fact that the office of trademarks gives the Chinese official Chinese companies the right to use a designation that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of 'Bang Mingpai', is relative.
The term is derived from 'Bang Dakuan'.
It is with this term that are designated women who are married men rich.
The Chinese authorities say I have nothing to reproach itself.
'It is bad for business, we must fight against this tendency', requires Pattloch.
'The is diluted, the uniqueness disappears, the damage for the reputation are enormous.'
The financial losses and legal costs amounting to millions for the sectors concerned, especially as regards the key products expensive.
According to the society of analysis of the market CLSA, China is, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third world market of luxury products and that the most rapidly growing.
However, it is not easy to delete the recordings of register of trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the trial in which the Court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the name 'criticised had become a reality of the market'.
Pattloch tells us that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be obliged to pay money to plagiaire, because it would have damaged its mark in China.
In this field, sometimes it is the law of the jungle prevails.
The famous case also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine Sany construction, the same company that had to buy the producer pumps Putzmeister concrete.
That is why the Chinese can use an emblem which resembles the star Mercedes.
Geely, the acquisiteur of Volvo, used before a logo white and blue reminded BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change.
The House of fashion Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore had reoriented the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
The trademarks agency CTMO in Beijing recognizes have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would be spent last year of a 'emergency situation in the course of work to normality restored'.
Thus, the number of procedures for untreated opposition would have fallen by 22%.
Almost 57,000 case of this kind would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding with the office.
Act is costing
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications submitted marks, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth time in succession top of the League for the number of new deposits in the world.
It is also for the total number of legal brands of 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have counted 1.8 billion yuan of law.
In other words, every registration has reported on average 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A legal battle is costing far more, as the case of the family business German Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiaire.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain that the illicit manufacture of components of vehicle is suspended.
However, the imitateur has been able to maintain its mark on the Chinese rights Freudenberg.
'It is our fault, because the names of family cannot be protected in Germany', explains Hanno Wentzler, President of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademarks agency was therefore rejected the objection of Munichites.
Freudenberg is persevering with the following two bodies, but the other side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is called for
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that it believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
However, it adds: 'the procedure is long, demanding and costing a lot of time and money.'
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The service of archives even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
There are five years, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other side 'a large sum in euros to six numbers' to settle the dispute.
'It is what we see what this means for us', entrusts Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to spill over in Europe.
This would be the case if copycats of this region is assuring the exploitation of trademarks not protected.
For example, a Chinese producer wants to table in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a company of production of leather footwear and.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was when even prevent.
Wentzler adds: 'vigilance is called for'.
Pattloch and advise him German firms to be very careful in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international law of trademarks, foreigners should instead 'register also in China everything which is likely to be protected', as stated Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs might be much more important than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle at the last act of his legal tragedy, the company should pay the licence fees to the other side for the use of his own behalf, as explained Wentzler.
Or so, we lose our place on the market segment in question.
World day fight against AIDS: bang foot sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeat at Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their time.
This is the history of a link passes much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
Firstly, we put the cowboy: the boots, the trainers, the escarpins for the ladies and mocassins for men seek the pace in striking the soil. Very quickly, they are.
One, two, three, four.
Secondly, the voice of the singers crescendo slowly - ALTO, low, tenor and soprano - they win, envoûtent and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses his shoes of background when it runs the orchestra with gestures of flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the Chamber of music of the Institute of psychology medical Heidelberg.
Fifty chanteuses and singers from 23 to 69 came, généticienne in human medicine to human rights at home.
'Om' Obani' is not an easy, every choriste has different words, in a language very exotic: the zoulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in certain regions in Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNAIDS, the UN programme to combat AIDS, believes that 34 million people throughout the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland account 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population are HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found the godfathers in Germany through the association 'Voices for Africa'.
70 of them attend secondary education.
For 15 or 20 euros per least we can become godfather.
This guarantees the child money for school, a uniform school and a daily warm meals at the centre gogo.
Imbongi means zoulou 'conteur fuss' or 'singer of praise'.
Nobody can be fluent in the language bantoue in this region, but all can sing.
For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in the foreign language that it has led in Germany for now make it to his home region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres to flight of bird of Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni village, which depends on the power of the German choir voice.
40% of people suffering
The village are roughly 2,000 inhabitants live in, some modest huttes of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has prevailed their parents.
To Esitjeni, we can see the small-scale what ails Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection at the highest and life expectancy the lowest in the world according to UNICEF.
The population does not accept almost never the male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a reduction proven the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the 30.
During a journey of group in Africa in spring 2005, the choir had discovered the village. The Imbongis have seen many children in the streets to which it was not only parental care, but also simply: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, school without qualifications, there is simply no prospect.
At the beginning, it was just a few people who are committed personally to pay a few euros every year in order to send a child to school and offer him a warm meals per day.
But barely a year later, the choir based 'Voices for Africa', an association which has since almost professional of AIDS orphans of Esitjeni.
Facts about the sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the IST bacterial, the late-stage syphilis, the chlamydiées and blennorragie (or gonorrhée).
The current IST are HIV Human Papilloma Virus, the herpès behavioural or hepatitis.
The hold of pubis and remained belong to the IST parasite.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
With syphilis and blennorragie are often among men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch believe that the sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four cases of late-stage syphilis on five declared in Germany.
Adults heterosexual the care-acquired infections, the chlamydiées trichomonase, oral (fungal), the blennorragie and Human Papilloma Virus are sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of the spread of HIV between adults heterosexual is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
Among the young, there is a rate of care-acquired infections chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to the European records, three-quarters of all infections involve young people aged 15 to 25 years.
Moreover, in Germany, the Human Papilloma Virus is common among young people.
What is the development of the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of late-stage syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections is decreasing.
In 2011, there has been estimated 2,700 case.
This represents a reduction of one tenth of the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause boil at the level of genital organs, the pain urinary, losses, the pain bas-ventre and the appearance of buttons and verrues.
However, they do regularly no pain or another symptom and, therefore, remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubrifiante or close personal contacts.
The experts therefore recommend to anyone changing often sexual partners to move regular reviews.
Most of the IST quickly dépistées can be cured and the effects of late can be avoided.
Thanks to the sponsorship, donations, but above all the funds that are reaping the choristes thanks to their voice through Germany, the means are accumulating.
'In all, we have already sent about 200,000 to EUR Esitjeni', precise Annette Lennartz, chairperson of the association.
The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman sure of itself and which always gets what it wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are housed in one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, it is thus so-called old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, they offer a roof and ensure that every day they go to school in their uniforms.
The orphan which has more person is welcomed in a safe place, among Khanyisile, a woman living alone and is paid by the association, as the two cookers every day that prepare meals for more than 200 starving children.
In addition, 'Voices for Africa' has created a school of counterfeited and enabled the construction of two houses. With the help of the Organisation for health SIP, the association has organised a test of HIV testing for many people.
That is not self-evident, because even if the disease is visible in the whole country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and its 14 wives
'The AIDS is a real taboo', explains Annette Lennartz, 'because this is an issue affecting sexuality.'
It is rather odd, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for his lifestyle excessive.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These mores punished by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV witnessed over recent decades.
Migrant workers have also dispersed the virus throughout the country.
There is nevertheless of condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, 'but almost nobody uses.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh '.
In order to promote somewhat cultural exchange, the choristes of Imbongi go together in travel every two or three years in South Africa and entonnent songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that number of inhabitants of the forefront of the black continent are still experiencing the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white who sing in African language is a recognition that it creates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes also a tear off to a formidable guards.
The bus displace them always to Esitjeni, where the choristes visit their godchildren.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
'Make to Esitjeni, you find the light,' say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres to theft of bird, back in Heidelberg, before these choristes who gets in the Chamber of repetition of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discover the presence of ice on mercury
The tube Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
The polar ice could achieve 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the sun, it contains water frozen, as explained three studies published this Thursday in the journal Science 'specialised'.
The spot Messenger reported evidence of the existence of ice coverage in the region of the planet constantly plunged into darkness.
This would have a coverage thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 metres.
Water is probably of comets or perhaps asteroids which would hit mercury.
However, no link between the discovery of water and the possibility of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist the spot, Sean Messenger Solomon.
The temperature on mercury can achieve 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements to life are arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Undetected of the inhabitants of our planet, of probes, telescopes and small robots as Phoenix investigate the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to land, such small interstices through which there is endless.
The image from a photographic system developed by researchers in Germany of the Institute Max-Planck.
The eight planets our solar system, and the planet dwarf on Cérès.
As Pluton, which orbit around the sun, behind Neptune Cérès is not seen as a 'world', according to the new definition of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of a photograph infrared taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a portrait of 'family' generations of countless stars: older stars are blue and the points roses, more difficult to identify, are the 'babies' in the delivery room of the universe.
The telescope Spitzer has discovered this region which produce the stars, dubbed 'W5', a name of little romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopée at 6,500 away.
The telescope Spitzer NASA photographed the outsider of a star dying.
The circle in the form of beignet is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies.
In the huge nebulous Trifide, 5,400 away from the Earth, the gas and the dust form of new stars.
The telescope Spitzer photographed this delivery room galactic.
The Pléiades, heaps of stars also called 'the seven sisters', can be observed to the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more colours in value.
This, the broader infrared of hélice, as a red light, look directly the viewer.
It is to 700 away in the constellation of Verseau.
Its similarities with a continent land earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the photograph of the photograph normal and infrared allows us to observe a spectacular colour.
Only the detectors infrared of the telescope Spitzer have been able to capture a picture of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest puzzles of Astronomy door on the creation of the Rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the Rings are the remains of a honeymoon Saturn who disappeared 4.5 billion of years without trace.
A photographs the largest and most clear that has taken the telescope Hubble is that of the galaxy the maelstrom.
According to the colour photographs of galaxies, the consequences can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebulous the Trifide in the constellation of Sagittaire, several thousands of light.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word 'trifidus' (divided, divided into three), because three dragged dust luisant divide the heart of the place of birth of the stars.
The astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic pile-up in the constellation of Serpentaire: to 400 million away from the Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies in merger rush to the other, the collision is inevitable.
The telescope Hubble has seen the birth of the stars in the galaxy M83 spiral.
If you do not like the abbreviations technical, you can use his nickname "wheel of southern fire '.
The photograph of the telescope Hubble space shows a detail of the broader the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The black hole is to 1,400 away and is made up of grain dust are ten to one hundred times smaller than the domestic dust.
This picture has been drawn up from optical and clichés X-ray taken by various telescope.
We can see the circle consisting of the black holes in 430 million away from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies christened Arp 273.
Scientists have appointed the greatest galaxy spiral 'GC 1810'.
In this cloud is the group of stars young the brighter lactée of our way.
The cradle Heavenly always gives rise to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are linked by the cloud of the rosette, create also constantly young stars to 5 000 light years away from the Earth.
In this galaxy to light and rays breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still not dust, there are only gas.
Scientists believe that it is born after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our eyes on the world: the main telescopes
The telescope would have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before the Galileo utilisât a year later to observe the stars.
Since, mirrors optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see still further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale of the Monitoring Centre on Mount Palomar almost San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror on this image was a diameter of five metres.
In the Arizona, the United States, is the Large Telescope Binocular.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors have a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias to La Palma, the Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been broken up in order to make savings.
The diameter achieved all eleven metres.
The disadvantage of the method of economic integration is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical, which restricts mobility.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly Texas is also set in the vertical perspective.
Its feature is its great capacity for collection of light.
Despite a diameter mirror relatively small, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescope to mirrors the world.
Scientists are listening to the universe in search of signals extra-terrestres of radiotélescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radiotélescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Anyone owner of a computer can help the 'Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence' (SETI, or 'research intelligence extra-terrestre') by contribution the power of calculation of the machine.
On the European Southern Observatory (ESO), in the Andes Chile.
This is the Very Large Telescope ('Very Large Telescope'), a worthy of its behalf.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can enlighten the spectrum infrared way.
The construction of a European Very Large Telescope (European extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its mirror main should reach the size impressive 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope cannot take photographs by 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the volcano hawaïen the KEA Mauna were regarded as the greatest of the world.
They were two mirrors a diameter of 10 metres everyone.
Telescopes of Keck are part of the observatory on Mauna KEA who observed the sky with the telescope Subaru and IRTF.
A new telescope huge should also be built on Mauna KEA and the diameter of its mirror reach 30 metres.
This example helps the admire.
However, the images of the most important area we are of the telescope Hubble space.
Since 24 April 1990, we book images of worlds away.
Since March 2009, the space of the telescope Kepler seeks exoplanètes, mainly those who are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This illustrates the final preparations for the launch of the telescope Kepler space.
The space telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in the area at the earliest in 2018 on board a rocket ARIANE 5.
The first mirror of the telescope infrared space has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The telescope will have a duty to find the light planned by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South of mercury is also of the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory, because there is much more Messenger orbit near the North Pole of mercury.
The data was radar for decades the presence of ice on mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the spot Messenger in 2004, the first to orbiter around mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the Patriarchs age of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which there is still relatively young to 97 years.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people are worthy of the Patriarchs age of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
An investigation into a country in which there is still relatively young to 97 years.
The trip in the mountains Talysh is a romantic échevelé.
By way of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahote the long of wooded hills, rivers torrentiels and firm modest.
Everything is green and fertile, you would almost in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the South of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is not just a few kilometres.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we know little, if this is that they speak perfectly Persian and the Azeri and that they have a very long lifespan.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its architecture too aggressive of the Soviet era, which is not at all with the mountain landscape picturesque.
European tourists are rare here, the journey since the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It is eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country has its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a place tourism.
'Baku became famous in May with the help of the Eurovision, and next year, there will be here the festival of older people in the world', explains Fatulayeva.
It is Director of the Museum longevity, the only museum of the world.
We can discover the life of approximately eight dozen Talysh of the region, which have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a picture in black and white.
My grandfather, it has reached the age of 120 years.
Yet have a child to 136 years
But the star controversial the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a standard, which would have had 168 years.
However, there is no birth records.
And when we believe that the old person documented had 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than questionable.
'It is born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973, precise Fatulayeva.
The man would be married three times and it would have been 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would have been few decades in calculating age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gérontologue the Institute Max-Planck of Rostock has also heard of the great age of Central Asia.
'surprisingly elderly people also live in certain regions of China, Japan or in the valley of Hunza in Pakistan', explains Scholz, 'in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old'.
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof due to the lack of documents, without forgetting that there was no register of civil status.
Every day, a glass of butter melted
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the region of Lerik reach age often a worthy of the Patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guides Azeri, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
By contrast, Fatulayeva, the Director of the Museum, believe that it is a question of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich of meals calorie Talysh, who like the meat, bread and milk products and many daily drink a glass of butter, melted be good for health.
Or is it the way of life simple which preserves the young people? to Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, live Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, which states have 143 descendants, live in a modest home of wood, as it is typical to see in the whole Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the ground a baratte, which it is the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long since adults.
Two small children where also in the home.
In the kitchen, tea are preparing for the guests served in glasses armadus typical in the form of stomach ache.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under its headscarf hiding tresses a long dark blond that his son reveals with pride.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and this is how I have never lost and that they have kept their colour.
'I have never used shampoo', adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
It has always eaten which comes from its own Farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my life, I have never bought the slightest food in a supermarket.
Secondly, it is her husband, who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has improved when the father Heydar Aliyev beloved 'took the lead.
The language of the propaganda surprised in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, is almost no limits in Azerbaijan
It has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham succéda him afterwards.
Nevertheless, the elderly people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives every month 230 manats (roughly the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps the son of long greying Mirzayeva is right: 'the elderly have a great respect in our Culture'.
They are the centre of the great family, they are popular, treated and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The 'Human rights' omitted in the Constitution
The revolution has surfaced in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations revealed the deep divide the country.
The draft Constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.
Egyptian President is not sparing words emplies of emotions.
We must manage the transition.
'And this success is my responsibility towards the people and to God, ” he said on state television.
His speech was designed for the entire people, but also especially the Copts Christians, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular.
Because all the members of the opposition confused and hopelessly divided are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi has said, almost by apologise, have temporarily restricts the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended its own 'in order to save the revolution'.
However, the Egyptians and the world do not know what that wants to save the engineer of 61 years, the holder of a doctorate from the American University of California of the South.
The judiciary be reversed?
The 234 articles written by the constituent assembly Muslim 100 people in a tour de force nocturnal fifteen hours are indeed worrying in a certain extent.
As in previous constitutions, the plan provides that the case law is based on 'the principles of Islamic law'.
But that really means the word 'principles'?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and the margin of manoeuvre related legal to apply a strict interpretation of the Sharia.
In any case is that suggests an article newly introduced stating that, as regards all the issues relating to the Sharia, the university Al-Azhar must be consulted. The establishment is the institution most important of the Islamic countries and its lustre an Sunni throughout the Islamic world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative machinery, which would de facto the tutelage of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the maintenance likely to military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts are employèrent to repress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, until 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The state must also, we read in the project, protect 'the true nature of the Egyptian family' and 'promote its moral and its values'.
A legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the state institutions could check the content of the cinema art and literature.
Clearly, it would be simply of censure.
Moreover, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbidden to offend or to defame the prophet Mohammed or his envoys.
However, Article does not define what is an offence or how it must be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to 'offend people'.
Enough of a caricature of the President or to tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that Morsi submitting to the vote and which, according to its own words, will very soon '' the subject of a referendum of the Egyptians.
'The revolution renait'
The opposition is mobilising for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual concord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the Sharia before it enters into force.
'The revolution is resurgent, and we will win', is launching Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and SNC of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is' to throw in the dustbin of history '.
On Twitter, the service of instant messaging, he has accused followers of Morsi to foment a 'coup against democracy'.
'If it proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and it will reverse,' exclame Jasser Said, an opponent.
'We are not even tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expié', said in the media Egyptian Khaled Ali, a politician and a Member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced do not want to monitor the referendum, which lead to the invalidity.
'The Koran is our Constitution'
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organised, called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organised in the University of Cairo.
Headscarved women and the supporters of the Salafis, who have participated in large numbers, coined the people: 'calls for the application of the law of God'.
'clean our country!', demandaient-ils to Morsi, by saying that 'the Koran [was their] Constitution'.
A battle for the sovereignty on the symbolic place Tharir, where everything began, would have very quickly created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what the advocates of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood have said that the opponents of the draft Constitution, at the same way that its supporters, were spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to leave the people decide through the ballot box of the direction that must take the country.
The project of Islamists will certainly the majority.
'The human rights are not mentioned only once'
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this constitutional process imposed which should continue until February and include all the social forces.
This human-rights lawyer of 48 years and President of the Egyptian Organisation of human rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
It did not because it shares their view of the world, but because to human rights are indivisible.
That is why it has been beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
'And now, the term is not even mentioned once in the new Constitution', regrette-t-il during his meeting with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of Morsi the three powers has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, whereupon President de facto all its powers' deplores Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, the battle between the different political ideologies on the brink of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could afford.
A protesting in Tharir warns: 'you accouchez a monster that you will be possible to control'.
The rakfisk Norway: is it the most fish odorant of the world?
The five million people in Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetites of premises for a fish extremely odorant?
Take some cheeses advanced.
Placez-les in the middle of a pile of clothing soccer wet and dirty.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell of a disturbing rakfisk delicacy, the most popular of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, at around 3 p.m. to Oslo.
Snow, the landscape is dramatically - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout made and fermented in salt water during a period - according to the smell that you want it exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the dark is established and that it is cold, the Norwegians gather to attend a festival here, to Fagernes, devoted to this incredible culinary speciality.
'You eat believed, then you avalez a glass of aquavit', explains Havard Halvarsen, local fire full-time the so-called 'Rakfisk General', responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people consume small pieces of fish and enfilent a large quantity of drink.
'Some people prefer aquavit rakfisk the', adds Havard.
The beverage kills the smell.
I am trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid doing so under your nose, this is not bad - it is reminiscent of a sushi which would have happened long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in Barriques water impervious to the air, then salé in the autumn.
Secondly, during the winter, a time of fermented, the fish is lifted and, undoubtedly with the sense of being undermined by alcohol - eaten.
The previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their countries to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing quickly - more than 13% of immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the top earners and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals which the country was not so long richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although odorant, of the past of Norway.
This is a party of the most expensive.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich you will cost $10.
Norway does not often talk about it in the international news, which is not to offend.
Here, people are not prepared to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they are talking about 'the incident of 22 July'.
The Norwegians have difficulty in accepting that in their peaceful, one of their could make such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway needs its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
'But oil is not the single reason which justifies our success, explains Anna, our barmaids, chevelure blond and in the eyes of a rookie numbing, the image of the Nordic welfare, with a plate of rakfisk in hand.
We are - how do you say - people prudent.
His English, as that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like us.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously - all, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries laid money around, during the years we have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse of tight.
'As we can skiing in winter and make the rambling in summer, we are pleased, precise Anna.
'Without forget the rakfisk', in a strong-competition laugh careless.
I am standing in the snow and I am waiting to buy food - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of impetus, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I have been is one of many places is rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most odorant of them.
There is a TV where the host a door nœud-papillon, surrounded by rakfisk bases.
We have gone to the support of the Eurovision.
'What score have you given the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?'
'This is our points, Havard.'
We hear of laughter and applause.
A man is its Chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or perhaps it is because of the fish product.
The Mexican Enrique PENA Nieto is a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique PENA Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, is interested in the difficulties ahead and expectations of the people, who are many.
Road traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where the traffic jams are rife in normal times, a dam security has been put in place since Monday, blocking access road several key in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people to travel to their work, but to prevent demonstrators to achieve Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique PENA Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new President of the nation.
A complicated task awaits it.
The economy of Mexico well, the results that we must at the outgoing President Felipe Calderón, but the country is facing a war on drugs which has already cost the lives of some 60,000 people in six years.
'My government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,' said Mr PENA Nieto the US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy which will allow us to achieve this aim.
Before alongside the American President, Mr PENA Nieto Governor of the state of Mexico.
A very populous state and sprawling which is stifling the capital. On its land favourite opinions are divided on this new leader.
A man direct
In the common bucolic of Good del Valle, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all.
The local to attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the common.
To join the city, you can take one of the new highways Mr PENA Nieto, a significant improvement has been provided to these roads, formerly bosselées and full of crevasses.
The sclerosis displaying his name are at the outside a new complex sport and of a museum interactive impressive dedicated to climate change.
'We are counting on him to establish lasting changes', has declared his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a Member of the Congress and the party of Mr PENA Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of safety and economy in particular, we hope a real change that our country desperately needs.
After 81 unfailing years in power, the PRI has been ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Member of the Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party on Enrique PENA Nieto.
It rejects the criticisms of opponents who blame the new President of a lack of charisma.
This is a man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
It is a great statesman and, above all, he knows listen.
However, this is not always that the people of their former Governor.
To Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden beneath the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also practical and cities.
Earlier this year, the military have been called upon to the rescue to combat drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster area, we found, on the edge of discharge, the bodies of tens of women murdered over the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr PENA Nieto Governor, much higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a notorious for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
The critics of Mr PENA Nieto, say that at best, it has not managed to stem the murders perpetrated against women when it was in office.
At worst, they are his administration to refuse to see the reality.
In a House in concrete, typical of this area, ramshackle Irinea Buendia fight to retain his tears when it shows me photographs daughter defunct, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, his family think she was killed by her partner.
'When I arrived at home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed', says the Señora Buendia.
Signs indicate that it had been beaten, and rigidity cadavérique was already started.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana packaged the wall, alongside a cross the word: justice.
However, that is exactly what the family is refused.
The authorities have treated as if I was an old commère, a fautrice, a pleurnicheuse.
They want that we accept what they say and that we remain silent.
'But this is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions, ” she said.
When President PENA Nieto receive their scarves Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico in the last six years and the new President has promised that it would make it its priority during his mandate.
'I hope that it will be as good as chairman when he was governor,' said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, Congressman.
However, that is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza the most fearful.
Private Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, state prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the demands of abuse which Private Bradley Manning would have been victim in detention.
The case concerns the detention of Manning in a military prison to Quantico, in Virginia.
Defence is to classify the case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning has made in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Private Bradley Manning - accused of being the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the US army - has missed out on numerous occasions to complain of ill-treatment that it claims to have suffered at its military detention.
At cross-examined with Manning, for a preliminary hearing to FT. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein has said that the recordings of visits made to weekly Manning officers for its nine months of detention to Quantico, Virginia, have not shown any complaint concerning its treatment.
The contre-interrogatoire - during a hearing, the defence has presented a request demanding that the matter Manning be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping is in very difficult conditions and has been a sufficiently severe punishment - took place a day after Manning has demonstrated its desire to kill himself during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during its service in Iraq.
The documents have subsequently been published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing of Friday, Fein has examined with Manning the forms that the officers have fulfilled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where it has been subject to a maximum prison isolation of July 2010 in April 2011.
The officers have asked questions on Manning and have recorded his replies.
When Fein has mentioned the forms, Friday, Manning has recognised that the treatment that he gave its guard was' excellent 'and that the treatment he had in the prison was essentially' very professional. '
The forms are no complaint for bad treatment, although the officers have directly asked about its prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning has replied that he had expressed orally concerns about some of the problems and the officers in visit had discussed its concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not presented the problems mentioned.
'They have written' no problem '(having addressed the concerns), and however, this does not mean that I did not raise problems,' said Manning.
The military judge. Theirs Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why it was not complained about his treatment at a meeting in January 2011 with the special committee which met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he expressed by writing a few months ago.
Manning has responded that its intention for the meeting was to amend its status restrictive indicating a 'risk of injury'.
The military have said that they had set this status restrictive - a level below the closer surveillance for risk of suicide - for its protection and safety of others.
'I wanted to know that the staff that I was going well, and I wanted to cut this status to enjoy better quality of life in my view,' said Manning.
Manning has shown on Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer in Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison of the basis of the Marine Corps to Quantico in Virginia, in July 2010.
He declared that we consider suicide when he was in Kuwait and lost once because of the heat.
He added that not having been informed of what would happen to him or of what was happening in the rest of the world was very frightening.
'My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in the cage', said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in the cage.
Again, Quantico Manning has said that he had spent most of its time in a small cell – at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
Manning has also added that the only objects available were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He has tried to stay in motion, because sleep or remain extended during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning has also said that when it tried to sleep, it was a light in the eye, lit outside his cell.
If the guards saw no its face when it is going on the night, they woken up in order to see its face.
The lawyer Manning has tabled a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning has been placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Friday, the judge has also asked questions on Manning on a claim reported in his testimony of Thursday - that having been forced to sleep naked a night in his cell to Quantico, has forced to stand naked before the Guards and other detainees a morning, during the appeal.
Manning has shown that at no time, it has been allowed to cover themselves with a coverage during the appeal.
During the issues of judge, Friday, Manning has said that he is deducted from the order of its guard that it must abandon its coverage which could hide its nakedness, but it has recognised that nobody had ordered the reins.
Thursday Manning has shown that it had been forced to sleep naked last night, because it would have tried to prove to an officer that it was not a danger for itself.
Manning would have said to the officer that it could use its elastic underpants or its tongs to injure, but that it had not.
That night, Manning has shown that his underwear, its tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experience that it has experienced during his detention and that it will considerably reduce its verdict if it were to be convicted before a court martial, a trial which should take place at the beginning of next year.
The defence has said that Manning intends to plead guilty of crimes of the less serious and fight for the abandonment other burdens deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with public prosecutors who should argue that the detention conditions were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been incarcerated in accordance with the regulation governing the conditions of detention of all detainees to Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of goods or public documents, the collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publishing information on the Internet, and the transmission of information relating to national defence.
If all the charges are accepted, it runs the criminal punishment in perpetuity.
My identity crisis mexico-américaine
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who are parties; they remind the Mexicans difficult times, he said.
Navarrette said that the Mexico-américains find themselves caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, before the customs services and immigration, I felt lost.
Signs indicate two ways: one for the 'Mexicanos' ('Mexicans'), another for the 'Extranjeros' ('Étrangers').
I am stood still for several seconds, not knowing what lead me to queue.
I grew up in the centre of California, where I have been called the 'Mexican' all my life.
It is a term ethnic, in the same way that my friends of Boston use when they say 'Irish', or my friends in New York when they say 'Italian'.
Secondly, I am now become 'Mexico-Américain'.
But, here it was Mexico.
And, on the land that has seen my grandfather, no need of special word or link.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or another language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of an indigenous and I cannot lose my emphasis.
When I took my American passport and I am led to the queue 'Étrangers'.
I thought at the time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique PENA Nieto visited the President Obama, to the White House.
Usually, when the leaders of these two countries meet their favourite subjects are immigration, drugs and trade.
PENA Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans to remain in Mexico rather than to risk the United States.
It wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And PENA Nieto is committed to the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although it has not provided more detail.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought to the fact that in 1848, the United States have invaded Mexico and its leaders forced to give in writing half of their territory to the forefront of a gun.
But Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elite - complaints on the way in which the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of Montezuma seek the fight.
And yet for Mexico, the relationship the more difficult is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Américains who live in the United States.
You want it addresses the issue of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country cannot offer.
The only reason the large number of cities as Mexican ancestors in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at the moment, in our traced, a person, perhaps a parent or a grand-parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.
And the more often, this person was a profile type - a little dark-skinned, well-educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently experiencing the American dream, that we went into good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to the United States.
Furthermore, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class we do not like.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were the individuals of strain and Mexican not enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our links with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is a failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never parties.
And we will not stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as souls lost.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and which has migrated legally in the United States when she was a child, remember that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexico-Américains, because the Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and Mexico-Américains are annoyed.
Although it is American citizen, it has the feel part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexico-Américains that I know have not feel part of a country or another.
We worship the music of the Mexican Group, Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we regard as the Americans.
And the United States, we regard as Mexicans.
And now, complicating a little more the relationship, as I have learned during my stay, some leaders Mexican and part of the intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Américains work as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We must explain to our compatriots American that Mexico is a superb countries that must absolutely visit and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
It does not happen.
There are too many bitterness.
And, if we consider the unequal pay, corruption and drug-related violence that are pervasive, many of us are not persuaded that it is a fantastic country.
You will have to fend for you, Amigos.
It is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of the way in which they have handled the Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexico-Américains always want them how their family members have been treated there has not so long.
Hmmm.
We might perhaps more 'Mexicans' that I thought.
Old grievances, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Not be able to ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
A further bloodshed seems to indicate that such a is vain hope.
While remain the same arguments futile to know who has begun, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the city of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians are stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has any shatters, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are overtaken by this regional upheaval.
Perhaps that their fight develops a little more.
However, there is every reason to think that this could help them to overcome this impasse.
A war which is no loser or no winner
At first sight, it seems difficult for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire given the 21 November is maintained, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza since 2007, targueront to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza has suffered a kicking.
Have killed some of its leaders and removed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one corner and overcrowded most miserable of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian other faction.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally.
The influence of Islamic of the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.
Turkey, a regional power booming, once the Muslim closest ally, Israel has sided with Hamas; like Qatar, one of the richest States more dynamic and the Gulf.
The members of Hamas may well gloat and say that the Islamist is growing trend around Israel, since the Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, via Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can reverse Bashar Assad, and until the Jordan, where Hamas ’ s allies threaten the king.
And the more important, on the southern flank of Israel, the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and more central the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who has ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
However, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders refer more easily to the public.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as a player that will not be excluded by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the hardliners in Israel will draw the conclusions opposite.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its full support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas to be the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Minister, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed approximately 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by the suicide attacks, especially through the separation barrier which encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish settlements which continue to spread despite their illegal in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud party has merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader in the run-up to the election of 22 January, has the hook.
Why these fichus dorloter giving them a Palestinian state?
If they were running the West Bank, does not lanceraient-ils rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and the start that they fall outside the head.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring change the situation.
Even if Islamists who take the power in Egypt and elsewhere like little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours.
Start a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire which bodes well - and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world which is becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians from their right to self-determination could create a powder keg which is dedicated to explode a day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
Both sides need to be driven by those from outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people that each side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of land by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to people outside of this cause.
Egypt, which must now undertake to put an end to the movement of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of ground and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs non-EU countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would be much more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a sham State to the UN.
Mr Obama has also interest that Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first term, it has not presented its own peace plan.
To return to the White House, it seems equally unwilling to establish one.
It is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is vital for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws of cigarette packs neutral entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photographs of organs sick cover the packages Greens bleak are all equal, regardless of the marks
This law entered into force in Australia is a first, the logos and colours have been replaced by a Green oil dark and horrific pictures of organs sick and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by smoking of their parents.
Outside the different photographs and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the mark, printed in small print on all the packages.
It is the regime the strictest in the world on packaging of tobacco.
The Australian Federal Government has said that the aim was to dissuade young people from smoking in removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there are 99% chance that they are ever.
'Even when they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,' said the Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, by quoting studies which have revealed, for example, that children brought the crown of a logo to a princess. '
Even if Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers have said that this would boost the black-market trade, which will give easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"harmful consequences of this legislation, 'said Scott McIntyre, the British American Tobacco Australia.
The counterfeiters of China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have said that this law was boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Import Zico Pty Ltd, small family businesses, has said that the request of cases to cigarettes, particularly in silicon to conceal the horrific packaging, has risen sharply there are two months since British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Britain' is, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost in the High Court Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, the cases are good.
The only problem, say the experts, is the popularity of social media and the tranche of people targeted by the plan.
After a series of laws Australian banning the advertising on TV, sports sponsorship and the obligation for dealers to conceal cigarettes, the marketing of tobacco is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign Web sites to do.
'If you are working in the marketing of tobacco and that you do not have any more than a small shop window for promoting your products, the Internet is the key place par excellence', said, a researcher Becky Freeman public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman have noticed an increase of the contributions of some ordinary citizens in favour of social media as trademarks on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who love the Marlboro cigarettes and that has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign mounted by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia has said that the industry focuses on the new regulation in force, rather than on the marketing.
Industry has gone up to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new decisions of justice - these countries have said to the WHO that trade is unjustly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have been important trade with Australia.
A decision of the WTO should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had discussions with other countries with similar laws on packaging.
Canada has been the first country to make it compulsory the pictures of warning on the packaging in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher legislation are currently under study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain untouched by these pictures.
The pictures I do not mind.
I do not know.
'You have a cigarette and you this the package', said Victor El Hage when buying a package on which is a photograph of tumor from the mouth.
To be frank, the only reason that I will stop, it is my young daughter.
James Yu, managing the 'King of the Pack tobacconist' in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made too difficult the packages on the shelves.
'First, I had an hour to unload a parcel, now, I have four hours' said Yu.
'The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said: OK, it is good, we must stop and the key under the door', he said, by lifting the arms to the sky.
In a world constantly connected, it can be good to be boring.
I have spent five hours in an airport during the period after Thanksgiving, because our plane was mechanical problems and we have had to wait for the arrival of another plane.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the subject of boredom.
I am not going to lie.
A half-day in an airport to wait a flight is quite boring, even when you books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in the development of the child are praising the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - is boring time to time, they say.
This force the brain to borrow the railways interesting, even feed creativity.
And as we are, for most, constantly to several types of screens, we are more the benefits of boredom.
Then we should welcome the trouble with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I will return.
Firstly, like many people, I thought that the problem was a recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, declare, Peter Toohey Greco-Roman history teacher at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of 'Boredom: has Lively History' (Yale University Press, 2011).
'The boredom dates back to very far', he says.
On the walls of Pompeii were Latin graffiti which refer to the trouble, they go back to the first century.
Secondly, there is the definition that we give to the problem.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, aggregate professor of psychology at the York University in the Ontario, Canada.
Having travelled many publications and put the idea of a group of discussion about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the boredom as an experience which is' to do something, but without coming to engage in a satisfactory activity '.
This distinguishes the problem of the apathy, he says is that the person is not undertaking a task well as it would.
With apathy, he says, there is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, it is the 'adjournment of the process of attention, together with a low mood and the feeling that time passes slowly'.
The problem can strongly resemble a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem is the environment or of the world, while people depressed believe that the problem of them.
Sometimes we think that we ennuyons when in fact it is a problem of concentration.
In the framework of their study, 'The Unengaged mind: Defining Boredom in terms of' Beware, which was published in the newspaper 'Perspectives we Psychological Science' in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted a experience oldest in which participants were listening cassettes, the voice of a person being read an article magazine.
Some groups have heard, from the Chamber to hand, it too high a TV had no report, others have just heard the emission of TV, and the third group has not heard the bande-son.
Those who have heard the TV to a low noise level have said that they were more annoyed that the two other groups - they have had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and have awarded this problem of concentration on boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult task or party, an interruption of attention can lead to the problem, Mark J. Fenske said, a professor of aggregate neurosciences to the University of Guelph in the Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, when you are doing a task boring, 'as watch on a conveyor belts, music can help you not to bore you.'
In fact, he says, we now know that when we are tortille or griffonne, these gestures, often regarded as signs of boredom, are in fact a good way to remain physically more alert.
'studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigoter learn more and more information than those who are forced to remain nothing', said Professor Fenske.
We all ennuyons a day or the other - the delay of my flight of aircraft, lacking in sparkle user with one voice, a film particularly annoying.
But some people are more likely to be boring than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a 'level' susceptibility to the problem in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements as, 'Among the tasks that I carried out, many of them are repetitive and monotonous' and 'I am so centres of interest that I do not have time to do everything'.
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to bore more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need incentives many and varied.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual development and Community the University of Illinois, during which it has contacted nearly 400 young people and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
It noted that 32% of young people declared is annoying to school and during their duties at home, while 23% declared is annoying when they were not at school.
However, 3% of parents have said is boring.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he knew that 'adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level', particularly because children and adolescents have little control over what they want to do.
If I based my question: the problem is good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can cause people to take risks physical absurd, bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as the studies show.
However, many philosophers and writers about a link between the boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, which examines the problem for more than two decades.
'The trouble is the way that the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else,' said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain do not always know what is the most appropriate to do.
If you ennuyez and that you use this energy to play the guitare and cooking, you will be happy.
But if you look at the TV, that you will be happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
If your child is weary and that you give it an iPad ennuiera, it is more, but it will not have learned to deal with alone and autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
And 'this autorèglement happening to a situation to another', he proclaims.
Your child do not learn only to entertain, it gets more control itself in other areas.
I do not think we should see the boredom.
As I do not think that we should criticise.
Feel comfortable outside the constant seething reservoir that generate the activities and technology is the objective towards which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.
'We need boring us more often, but the boredom arouses desire acute and frenzied to be connected to something which makes sense,' he said.
According to what people are seeking, it is a means to disconnect and appreciate the time.
'In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés', he added, 'it is difficult to find ways of engaging in something when noise stops.'
In Colorado, no directive for the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years, in a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged for something which will soon become a legal state: in its possession of marijuana regard and pipe used to the smoking.
Mr Orozco said that one day, in September, and a few friends were on board a car Lamar, in the middle of fields, near the border with the Kansas, when they have been arrested.
After that the police officer has found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco has received a summons for possession of drugs and material used to its consumption - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
'We are treated as criminals,' said Mr Orozco.
But what a?
During the weeks of uncertainty which followed the vote of Colorado to legalise the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving a low use of drugs is more dependent on the place that the law.
Here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without result.
The police have ceased to indict adults of 21 years and more minor for possession of marihuana, because the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are in the constituencies more conservative of Colorado called to speed up the existing marijuana Affairs and continue to indict those who possess.
The same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the opening of shops sell marijuana registered by the state in their neighbourhoods.
'The things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what we reserve the future,' said Mr J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, is in Denver.
The regulatory bodies of the Washington State there are also many questions.
They are in search of directives on the way to establish a system of permits, to produce, manufacture, sell and distribute - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most of the States in the regulation on marijuana, firstly, concerning the use for therapeutic purposes and now as regards personal use.
'The Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator', said Brian E. Smith, spokesperson of the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognises Mr Smith, can do no more than suggest what works.
'There is no real precedent on which we could calculate, he said.
The law of Washington, which is I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vacuum a year, during which the system of licences does not always exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the State which guarantees adequate access to marijuana licensed and prohibits the installation of shops of sale of cannabis within a radius of 30 km radius of a school, to a park, a playground or a crèche.
'There will be no places more difficult than urban areas to install an authorised trade sale of cannabis, particularly in the metropolitan area of Seattle', has declared Bin Livingston, a spokesman of the Centre of legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the leader of the police, Oates, Aurora, has sent an e-mail to its officers' City announcing that the US Attorney '(representative of the public prosecutor) would be more people of 21 years and more with small quantities of marihuana, and that the police should stop charge of people for this type of offence' to 'immediate effect.
The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new decisions of Justice which regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that it will continue to pursue the drug traffickers and drug dealers.
To Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the US Attorney '(' district Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken buck, embodies a more stringent.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marihuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users to désintoxiquer.
At the moment, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marihuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
'Our office has the obligation to bring proceedings against those people who have committed a crime which, at the time of the facts, was an infringement recognised,' said Mr buck.
The reactions have been complicated even in rural areas as Mesa County, where the voters have rejected the initiative in favour of the limited use marijuana.
The police to Great Junction, the greatest city in the county is no longer appear adults for possession of small quantities.
The representative of the public prosecutor, County Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the cases of detention of marijuana.
'I do not have the impression of losing my time to continue to apply the law until it to change', he said.
Although 55% of voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and government appropriate personal use marijuana is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions which have been observed in various US cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials as regards the legalisation of marijuana.
'It is a cultural barrier' with the representatives of the public prosecutor has said, Sean McAllister a lawyer in Denver, which represents the people accused of consumption of marijuana, and which is expressed as spokesman of the local 'National Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws' (National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana).
'They have spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who consumed marijuana, too, have difficulty in accepting that it is legal,' he said.
As the first States to deal with the restricted use marijuana at the same level of alcohol, Colorado and the rule of Washington are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While defenders and representatives of the state for a new frontier of sales legalised, they expect with concern the directives of the Federal Government, which is always the sale and the culture of marijuana federal as crimes.
The defenders of the legalisation of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will.
Despite some high-profile arrests of patients in marijuana therapeutic and sellers, the federal government has enabled the shops sell marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
It is true that the police is unlikely to seize the small packs drugs, it is likely that it opposes the shops sell marijuana authorised for personal use authorised by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser policy of the Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities act.
Well before the votes, some local administrations have approved moratoria on the creation of new businesses of sale of marihuana, even if it is only a postponement of one year.
Last week, the city of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.
'We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves in a federal problem,' said Mr Nicholson, a Member of the town council.
Our Community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the Community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Wyatt Petronella: I have been bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a 'Tory' (conservative).
It is not only students today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I have always dreamed to enter the Oxford University.
My father and my older brother have studied in what was a prominent place to know, a sort of Greek amphithéâtre of modern times which stimulates the two pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after me to be installed Worcester College at the end of the 1980s for study history, I have decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and came to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The newspaper The Evening Standard has claimed that I had left the University, because I had objected the fact that students the first round had sexual relations in the Chamber to side of mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with quirk that I was part after having been forced to drink in tasses ébréchées.
The truth was less entertaining.
I have fled.
Yes, I have fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation and is subject to constant bullying.
Not because of my name rather extreme, or because of the fact that I had a private school.
I have been persecuted for a single reason, and in the birthplace of the so-called know, I have been the victim of racist behaviour and barbaric: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised of Margaret Thatcher and I was in favour of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you may say.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of students centre-right suffers the same kind of persecution.
The growing hatred and institutionalised Tory students to Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, at the same as those gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
The Conservative Members of the Chamber of students (JCR) of the corpus Christi College have said they were 'often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable' because of their political opinions.
They want that there is a representative in the Committee of the university to equal opportunities in order that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Rights' ('The country wonders: young, intelligent and right wing'), on the policy among students, and that 'painted a graphic picture the Tories' as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It found particularly the student Joe Cooke, former President of the 'conservative Oxford University Association (OUCA)', which moves in Rolls-Royce, bears a comprehensive well-off and moves with a rod to head chromée.
In other universities, students Conservatives say be treated as scapegoats of the implementation of the increase of tuition fees. '
Luke Black, 20 years, Vice-President of the 'Nottingham University conservative' Association, has said on a Sunday newspaper 'there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think that we are as the Club Bullingdon without even we have encountered. '
Samuel Roberts, 21 years, student in history to Corpus Christi, which has tabled a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is' and ', uncomfortable Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, President of the OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR people who are centre-right.
'This is an obstacle to the freedom of the debates intellectuals, and the welfare of Members' she said.
I was the only to think that during my first weeks in Oxford.
I came in September 1986, I was aged 18 years and a crippling timidity.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was very fierce.
The previous year, the university had voted the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary doctorates, because of the reduction in financing of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with vibrations Stalinist.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students have seen with the other and teachers, I had a foretaste of what will happen afterwards.
I have discovered that the teachers were not only the sarcasm to students Tory, but that they were fun.
It was as if the policy on the subject of minors strikers, privatisation and the opposition from the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was set in the timber from classrooms.
The first ludicrous which I have been the victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the eighteenth century, and I was not prepared.
'Miss Wyatt,' said the teacher Harry Pitt (now deceased), 'please translate the first paragraph'
I have lost touch.
Pitt, a small man in the face pustuleux, is easily outweigh.
'Are the Thatchéristes refuse to learn the French or are they just stupid?' he asked.
Other students have amusement.
The tears I were being destroyed by fire.
'I suggest that you take of French during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy you make friends', he launched a snarling bearskin.
I am turning in my room, inconsolable.
At the dinner that evening, I am only then I felt a slight attack on my shoulders.
It was a student in the second year of studies of English, appointed James, which is presented as a Member of the OUCA.
"I know that you are ', he said, gently.
I am afraid that.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It is already quite hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will therefore be even harder for thee.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, the local pub cowardly, I have tried to hide.
I have insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything that was said by Mrs Thatcher.
This trick has failed.
A student at first year of philosophy, political and economic science, ironically, studied in Eton, said: 'You are the daughter of a pig fascist'.
You are contaminated.
Other students have included the tune.
I was perverted dirty.
'How the Tories are love? "asked one of them.
They affect each other, is it not? '
I felt as homosexuals before the liberal law of the 1960s.
I would have only been able to lead a normal life to Oxford?
I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dusk?
Should I have become Labour and deny my views?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only Professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
It was detested not only because it was conservative, but also because it was in external policy adviser Thatcher and one of the authors of his speech.
It was almost never here.
He disliked this place provincial and insignificant, and its accession to the point of view marxiste-déterministe of history.
In 1997, he accepted a university teacher of Bilkent in Ankara, in Turkey.
'You do not become happy here', he said.
I have begun to shuttle between Oxford and the House of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends urban more open mind.
I said in my father that I hated Oxford and I have explained why.
It was sceptical.
During its studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all the political points of view were accepted.
'But that is the best place in the world', he said moving pleas.
They do not do it, not in the city the spire dreamers.
Even my friends Communists had ways beyond reproach.
He had tears in their eyes.
Laisse-leur a chance.
I am sure that this is to goad.
I would break the heart if you leave Oxford.
Tired by my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and has abandoned its convictions.
During a sitting of tutorials the following week, when a teacher of history has suggested the most serious of the world, that I was' a people's enemy ', I decided to do so.
Internally rougissant of shame, I have admitted be victim to brainwashing of my parents and traitai of 'old' mad.
The respite was short-lived.
It is my father who drove the last nail my coffin oxfordien.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the press of Murdoch every week.
My door was frozen.
I am been cowering in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors have abandoned.
When they are parties, I made my suitcase and I have taken the first package for London.
I have never returned.
You can address wimp pleurnicharde.
But no child of 18 years should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only has produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys a solid reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
'Valentino prefer the grace to fame'
In the framework of the exhibition 'Valentino: a Master of styling', inaugurated this week in London, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other clientes famous the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elisabeth ire of England, is the only place of the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The fashion designer has recognised at the inauguration of 'Valentino: a Master of the retrospective styling', a prestigious which more than 130 models fashion created for his house of counterfeited over the past 50 years.
'I love this building,' he said with his own inimitable emphasis Italian.
This exhibition is the culmination of a history which the only player has' signore 'Garavani, but it could be written without its famous clientes.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first exhibition hall, open until 3 March, there is an impressive number of letters private and photographs signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan Education Services until Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes its personal memories as the trophies of its social fashion designer modest: the rise of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, the Idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong to love the monarchy.
'At least, they do not wipe their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet as some of the pop stars', says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a dramatic and receives with generosity and elegance.
'We adorions all be invited in its hunting of Gstaad', explains the registered 'Heini' Thyssen, friend intimate beauties of time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the grace to the reputation.
Even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, a model Valentino
The Argentine blow-up, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of fashion designer.
There are several years, after a parade in Spain, in Rome, we went dinner in his apartment.
We were a dozen people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and saw his spirit in every detail of his apartment in decoration, food, music.
'With him, each invited felt important and liked' recalls the 'top model', which has begun to work with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
'It will never be acceptable fashion, because its creations are works of art' termine-t-elle.
Out of line of nobility
The lives of Garavani is not a history of obsessions but of love shared.
He likes to the people of high and with the greatest securities and love them too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of 60 metres wide which proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must March on the podium to admire a 'public' dream the main creations of Valentino, as the matches that had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the position that was Monica Vitti in 'The Notte', or a wool and fur coat who belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the public mannequins, there are names as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn and taxis Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Mrs von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal in 2006 and the fashion designer
Many of its clientes say that the first clothes Valentino are as the first love, 'impossible to forget'.
I remember perfectly well.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a lifebelt fast 'gillette' and a jacket of the collection automne-hiver 1971-1972.
'It is a gift that it had made me,' said Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of fashion designer.
'I prefer to all the others for their femininity, its great love of women, and because it sublime our' beauty, adds ex-duchesse of Feria.
I very much like the colours it uses, they are efficient and clarify the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time that it has been a model Valentino.
When it was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreams of age and the opportunity to bring one of its robes evening...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the House of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a penitent evening, with a red to skirt volants, a bustier draped and up to fall.
'It was a dream become reality, "said the widow of Rodrigue of Arenberg.
'Valentino is indifferent to the way, it is obsessed with the timeless', he was as an aristocrat explains the Italian who share his life in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess of Arenberg retains the skirts of evening of fashion designer with 'the greatest care, because a penitent the evening is not only a penitent, it is also the whole of memories it vehicle'.
The 'King' fashion
The great final exposure of Somerset House's dress is married to Marie-Chantal Miller during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 'ragazze' (the so-called fashion designer and its seamstresses) to achieve this penitent in silk ivory with incrustations of beads, twelve kinds of dentelles different and a laggard of four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, Supreme authority of the press, this represents a penitent historical fact of the High styling the end of the 20th century, 'the return of clientes of the High society'.
Which is obsessed for years by the 'savoir-être' of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere, Commandeur of the Bar of Arts and Letras, decorated of the Legion of Honour, Garavani aggregated all credit that any husband of its clientes.
'His refinement, calm, its aspect treated and perfect, I have always made very clear to me', acknowledges Arenberg.
The last time I have seen, it was a month at a dinner at night Museum d'Orsay.
He was sitting on the table of the Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my main girlfriends.
'It was impeccable the years have no effect on him'.
If this is a princess who said...
The profession the hardest of the world: mules human Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the volcano Indonesian risk their lives and their health by 70 kilos of sulphur through footpaths escarpés stone.
There are people for whom the work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 minors who earn their living in the sulphur content of the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the substance of the crater, where gas sulfurique from the vaults of the land solidifie contact with the air.
After having seen large rocks of sulphur, which are in total almost 70 kilos, it develops in two baskets in bamboo that this burden on its shoulders through footpaths escarpés.
There is only 250 metres until top of the volcano which stands to 2,386 metres, but the exhausted are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a rate of tortoise, bearing the balance and not for measuring their not stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that a false not could cost them life, as has happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen there are several years.
Minors of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur content.
Once, we find a path between tourists who photographient as if they were circus animals, and the heavy painfully baskets, they walk the 3 kilometres up to the balance that a mining company has established a little below to 1,850 metres.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating the volcano since 1960, and we can say, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5) euro cents per kilo of sulphur.
It sells then rupees 10,000 (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry ore since this is very much present in the daily life and is used to manufacture candles, fireworks, cosmetics, of dynamite and being used to launder sugar.
'As we move around 70 kilos, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (EUR 3.8) to every journey', explains Anto, which operates in general three trips per day.
All it takes three hours and it ends up, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a pittance for such a superhuman effort is triple that it would add in the fields.
'The income of minors is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) by day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (EUR 167)', says the bearer used as a bricklayer who worked on the island of Bali tourism.
There, their salary was to 75,000 rupees (EUR 6,20) by day and the job was not as difficult, but income Anto is close to his family to Banyuwangi, a village near of the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: 'I have espoused a girl of Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have reduced Java for it to converting to Islam'.
Anto is suffering from asthma, breathe with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
To 27 years, it has spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulphur has already begun to pay the bill although it covers the face with a special and gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathe with difficulty, constantly coughing fit and its eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
This is the price that it must pay to continue its dream.
I will work even two years, because I want to open a shop or study the Spanish or French 'promet-t-il English in a more than acceptable.
By life, this young engaging and intelligent could be guide server or tourism, in a hotel receptionist, but, instead, it is the work of a donkey.
It shares a timber masure unhealthy with other carriers, rose every day to two hours of the morning because the sulphur does not cease to discover the night, when its colour yellow characteristic is blue and is conspicuous in the middle of the dark.
Defying the darkness Anto staying in the crater by illuminating with a small bottle set to his helmet, he has bought himself with its own money.
Some 400 carriers responsible baskets of sulphur on their shoulders over the substance of the crater.
Despite its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mécanisé the extraction of sulphur to save the costs and provides no equipment for carriers who work on board and are paid to the burden.

Singapore research babies to save the economy
The Singapouriens lay the responsibility of this lack of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to property.
'The population of Singapore must develop'.
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, are fulfilling our duty and civic life!
It may seem unlikely that these words have just advertising of pellets Mint, but despite this, or perhaps thanks to this, the video spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words of a group of rap which uses references local as' will put an open in the drawer 'to mock the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of video, hope to draw attention to the problem in a funny thanks to this advertising.
Its director creative, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of the music for the people to fulfil their duty 'national'.
It is intended solely to the Internet, we have therefore been entertaining and make fun.
It is the main problem in that country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth and we felt that it was a subject that we must address.
We knew that the government had tried several things as the launch of perfumes phéromones or organise speed-dating events.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they have not necessarily work.
We have therefore said the following: what is more creative to solve this problem to a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore do not take more seriously.
He spends USD 1,300 per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers gives up to $15,000 by child, longer maternity leave and tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech cité-État South-East Asia, also known for conservatism of its leaders and its social strict controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, is currently to 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it has been above 2, regarded as the replacement rate, it was in 1976.
Why the Singapouriens not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of the policies of marriage and the family of the National the Population Division, says that this is due to a 'better education' and 'a wider choice of career opportunities'.
'This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and the constitution of a family', explain.
These changes social standards have contributed to increasing the number of single and delaying marriage and the birth rate, which results in a falling birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at increasing radically immigration to counter the reduction of the population has created a resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites which is a thinly disguised xenophobia against the new immigrants, in particular to the Chinese who are accused of wages down and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore has experienced last year its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Consequences inespérées
While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a country, the tax revenues, the health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore has also unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small homes.
For example, it has started to affect the housing sector.
The authorities of urban development have begun to control the number of small flats, known as' box to footwear ', which can be built in the areas of the city.
These flats have an area of 46 square metres and their sale wins great success.
However, the authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage the promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the buildings EL Developers society, states that its' letter-box footwear 'sell much more quickly than houses greatest.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much more quickly than those of greater size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasuries.
However, it recognises that the new standards give instructions clearer developers, which was previously a spanner in the works if they wish to propose too small homes in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a cité-État.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the birth rate, in discussions with the national Singapouriens who work in the area of financial centre, it would appear that they do not have much effect.
'The people are very stressed-out, houses are expensive, just as education, that is why people back to later', says a young framework.
The other people can have children.
'But for me, it is important to have my money and my time', we declare a young than 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them to have children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, are the Singapouriens themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy Spaniard, it is the quality of the private sector or 'the area of private life that we can protect any intrusion'.
That is the private domain est-ce-qui for the less than 16 years?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and social networks?
Understand the hazards it is exposed by disseminating on the Internet of the events that it does not share certainly offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico asked five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they have involved the term 'something very staff' personal and 'the user and the name of' when they have applied to social networks.
'I do not my dévoilerai in a more personal secret the post', says Jorge, ten years, when it is trying to explain the meaning of private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Windows Hotmail and Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years.
Secret 'These are very secret, my mother can know them, but not everyone', he says.
On Belgian francs, I post images sympas or games.
I discussed with my friends.
'I do not share one of my photographs or someone who would be stupid', he says.
The boy recognises that it is wrong to publish obscene, photographs of naked people involved, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures that it knows his 35 friends on Belgian francs and its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
His mother in fact part, it is the watchword of one of Auditors.
I have opened a account Twitter to speak and write tweets interesting.
'I do not know if they say, I simply the post', it added.
'The social networks are fun, I can speak with parents remote or with my friends, rapid way', he says.
It states that it would never accept the request of a person unknown.
It will not trust to someone who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years, is different.
The teenager has of Auditors on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on this last, it does not have 20 people included on its list of friends.
'That does not worry me because we have something in common, music, for example', he proclaims.
According to the boy, nobody has been advances or asked him his address or his telephone number.
'If they were putting pressure or demanded, I simply supprimerais my account', agree.
José has subscriber to Ask having read a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the young boy.
A close to a friend of mine was extorted money from a social network.
They have threatened and have demanded that the money.
'It has never known that it was' ensuring.
The victim, according to José, has not closed.
'It has just happened in profile private'.
We then to state a series of manipulation to make his account of safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photographs of knowledge in awkward situations or embarrassing.
Yes, I would do so if I were angry or annoyed.
'Even though I know that this is the cyberharcèlement', he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, Professor of English and dismissed in Education and report, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, we must understand that the aim of the social networks is to inform.
'The Internet has created as a means to seek information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game', mention has changed.
Porras point out that the academic Marc Prensky, which has a Masters Course in teaching of Yale University and author of the book 'native-born and digital immigrants', uses these words to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they, children and young people who are born with technology.
'We, we are immigrants digital must teach them, while we ourselves are learning', it says.
It adds that the issue is complex, 'because we are asking them to be a criterion defined on what is needed or not to disclose, to publish or say in an age when they do not have the necessary maturity to do it'.
'We ask them too to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, for thousands of friends' strong-competition without thinking about the consequences.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the confidentiality at children and adolescents is to use of the issues are sobering.
'their say not to do it serves no', she says.
Secondly, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you do not raconterais to a foreigner, why the fais-tu on the Internet?
Or, this plairait-il you that they publish a photograph of you as a friend that you published?
Sais-tu what others publish on you?
When you festive season, identifies photos demandes-tu to other people permission to identify them?
And also, is everyone need to know what you refer to the time?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act in line as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
'Hors of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be the same on the social networks', she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher education and adviser says it is essential that the parents read carefully the conditions for using social networks.
Understanding each of the words, they will have a solid basis for discussions with their children of the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
'So example, age and what it is allowed to share or publish', he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind the children that we should not talk to strangers.
The summit of the Unasur ended without that the Lima Declaration to be made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been announced previously and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe has tried repeatedly access to the document signed at the sixth ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have pointed out at the outset that it would be released after the closure of the summit, then have said that it would be published a moment on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When they have been asked about the text, they have pointed out that its content has been described by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief press statements.
The journalists have access to information on the summit has constantly been limited.
During the day, only the video without his presidential Assembly with the message 'private session, audio restricted' was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating between journalists have been those data by the press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur who participate in the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only a leaked document during the day was the list of Presidents present, which caused a certain unease among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who were demanding information more important.
Later, the Presidency of Peru has sent an e-mail to the media with the 'final declaration' the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which has reached the summit.
In October, Peru was the guest of the 3rd Arab Sud-Pays America Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been called emphatically by the press, it had not broadcast the statement also called Lima Declaration, as was previously announced.
On the Web site of the ASPA, we can check that the document has been published in March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission safe for all the journalists, but they have limited maximum obtaining information.
The summit has also concluded with the joint agreement Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague which tranche a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meetings and declared that they would respect the decision to the ICJ to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima has instituted against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague.
'We will respect and would leave the verdict, which will resolve the differences that we are today in this international court', said President Humala, alongside its counterpart Chilean.
'The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversy, the Treaties and the international courts', has added President Piñera by giving a handshake President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two Presidents that they submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to comply with the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime limits with Nicaragua she considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended the Unasur since 2011 following the removal of its former President Fernando Lugo, has not been achieved.
President host, Ollanta Humala, has been mandated to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit shortly after 12 noon in Lima.
The contractor has read the final document in which it has announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been established between the South American countries for a total of 17 million dollars investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the Unasur put in place 'important steps to achieve the aim of the South American citizenship by the development of agreements on residence permits'.
It informed that action would be put in place to improve the 'cooperation in the fight against insecurity and urban against international organised crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effective the risks of natural disasters'.
With a Europe in crisis, 'economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a matrix triumphalistic but must help to increase our matrix productive and to see a better future for our peoples', has concluded President Humala.
'We have chosen to prioritise a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection of the areas of South America, especially in rural areas and border... between our countries and generating new economic cycles,' said the Peruvian President, in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the horizontal strands of its territory, since the coast up in Brazil, and that two sought a more important connection with Ecuador although it has not given more detail.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
'We hope that the electoral process of this country will enable its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations', which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another issue at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, has said, before starting the regional meetings, that he hoped to meet its counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next Saturday in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime dispute through to a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
'It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega', said President Santos.
'We are going to review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua that will ask to have a discussion with this country,' he said.
'I hope to say to President Ortega that we are going to sort out of the most civilised and environmentally friendly as possible', has added President Santos.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to attend the power of the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc meet prior to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although this country is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency acting President of the regional bloc.
'The South America needs to learn how to integrate Europe citizenship', says Rafael Correa.
President Rafael Correa in Ecuador, has said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which the 'South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe'.
President Correa, who has participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, has said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans' were killing each other during the Second World War 'and in other conflicts,' but that they were now almost a homeland '.
In this regard, it has defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the Unasur.
'It must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any Latin American country, as is already the case for the Members of the Andean Community, but there is still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past, he warned.
In addition, Ecuadorean President has shown in favour of the recovery of the Organisation of American States (OAS) with the aim to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and to take account of the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who have bombarded us is never compromise, on the contrary, we, the Latin American, have all signed.
'It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is to Washington in the financing of the United States,' he said, referring to political asylum is granted by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that it does not regret its decision, because it has itself not betrayed its principles, but instead respected its' deep democratic values and human rights'.
He concluded that at the time, 'there was the suspicion that Assange be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected'.
Moreover, it criticises the Swedish courts which has demanded that it meets on its territory to interrogation about alleged a sex crime while the 'own Swedish legislation enables us to do by videoconference, which could be done since the Embassy of Ecuador to London'.
Correa said that there is a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorating.
'I have not spoken to him for it is in our embassy, but the Ambassador has informed me that he had a small problem, but nothing serious lung', said Ecuadorean President.
It is possible that its physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact of being trapped in a small area without be able to exercise in the open air.
'That is on the health of any, it concludes that'.
Correa point out that the solution of asylum for Assange since the June in the embassy Ecuadorean of London, which would be the allocation of safe-conduct which would allow him to travel in Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and it stresses that it was discussed in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there has been ongoing discussions.
'The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because the lawyer for Assange Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of procedures to various European bodies', he mentioned.
And he believes that 'if Britain granted the safe-conduct tomorrow, this end'.
And if Sweden, as is entirely its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, asked Mr Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or inertness via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be resolved.
Correa has benefited to reaffirm as a defender of freedom of the press and he has stated that it did not was' the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lies that are detrimental to the freedom of expression '.
'The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians malicious or perverse but bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion,' he said.
In this light, it has welcomed that this is not this kind of journalists' or the bankers and the bourgeois hegemonic countries and which dominate in Ecuador 'and, instead of putting forward his re-election,' it approfondirait the revolution to pursue the path and pave the way '.
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, in arguing that the agency 'should be firm and does not tolerate the opportunism and the attempts of disguised coup', because in reality, 'it destroys the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy'.
What is more, Ecuadorean President considers' entirely relevant 'the desire for Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a Latin American country and a Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to move forward together.
We must resolve them in their together to overcome them and move forward.
In the same time, it is said confident in the right resolution of the dispute regarding the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court, and he said that 'it is beneficial that Latin America to the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment if firm that it is'.
With reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate for future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to seek a third consecutive term, it has indicated that he saw this possibility 'with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes rather difficult'.
Correa assured that, if it lost the selection of February 2013, it withdrawing from public life.
On a personal level, the power has never interested, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, socio-economic this poverty cannot be resolved by means of political power.
'My political movement was believed that it was I who guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility,' he said.
If I gagnais, this would be my last presidential term and I will withdraw then political life.
If we lose, I would also.
'It is my decision,' he said.
Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have to discuss with the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he expected the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
'That does not mean a sequel to the health of President Chávez,' he commented on.
The Head of State Ecuadorean participated today in Lima in the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for better regional integration in order to support the progress, equality and security.
The deaths linked to AIDS are today due to a belated detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years when it has confirmed the result of the test: HIV positive.
'It is as if the sky was standing on the head', he referring when the announcement that the doctor tried to make 'less painful', in vain.
The young man has hidden to his family.
It decided to take care of his illness and began to be informed about it and its determination has been such that it has just celebrated its 43rd anniversary.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of HIV the hospital civilian Guadalajara (HCG), in which it is in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio live with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and stigma.
Then, even the director of a clinic the IMSS escaped him say goodbye 'because it was without voice'.
At that time, have AIDS means death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people are even when the virus has already caused damage, 'exhausted' their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, 'the great victory is today that the survival of a patient treatment which started at the appropriate time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same', has indicated the leader of the unity of HIV the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes for reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a scientific publication prestigious.
The expert infectiologue and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depends on the level of allocation of the immune system that had patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those using drugs: not up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis HIV positive to 25 years, 'as it will remain under control without problems, can live up to 75 years', has explained the scientific questioned.
In order to put this progress in its context, it must be aware that the life expectancy of Mexico is today 76 years on average.
It is true that the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS is past of 6,678 case in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report from UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients recorded on the basis of national data are dead.
Nothing that Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there has been 187 deaths until May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral medicines is universal since 2005.
So why is there still deaths?
I believe that the problem is no access to treatment.
That is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
On the past 12 years at least, we have never failed to medicines, the problem is that patients are very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or when they learn to the advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable 'nine in ten patients come when they are already an infection opportunistic, what we need to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is deliver early diagnosis and more, for this, it must propose screening tests on a massive scale, to all those people who are asking for'.
Specialists and the members of the Council of State of Jalisco prevention of AIDS (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as patients themselves, as Fabrizio, which has done its screening test in a laboratory private, simply because a friend had done and that, despite its young age, it was already the bearer of AIDS and had sarcome of Kaposi, a cancerous growth which is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die and are not interested.
'If I will die, it is better than I am erupts three times per week,' they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am of the financial year, I take my medicines.
To this day, its parents know only that it suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, as anyone else.
'I am working, I have many activities, I, I have an active life, but I am involved attention to me and the other person', recounts Fabrizio, which has agreed to share its intimacy with MILENIO Jalisco to help, through his testimony, those who fear today, during the operation of the World Day against AIDS.
They make the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will soon if they are positive and the better, and if they have already the diagnosis, they should know that we can live as everyone, being responsible.
His message summarises the slogan of the battle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms on the desk
There are many gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar Guadalajara, a journalist who have embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, 'we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, is now gives us the packages of%, it is very well, but that means that, even today, some have no access to condoms', he says.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections, adolescents.
The question: 'What are you going to do?', with ludicrous and value judgments by the social workers, advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that young people do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect this distribution ineffective; that condoms are not only sold in shops, but that we find them in the public toilets distributors and in places that are young people.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
It is not of their pay girls and the motel, as had responded Governor Emilio González when asked if there is a distribution of condoms in its administration.
'This is not how it works sexuality, the best is to provide of condoms to people already sexually', he pointed out.
The figures to Jalisco
There are 13,435 case cumulative (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is the fourth state of the country number of new cases and cumulative case of AIDS and 13th for the number of those infected with HIV.
92% of contamination are promiscuous, 6% through the blood and 2% by road perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore.
A judgment ratified by a court of appeal US ignores the debt restructuring of the group vitro granted via a bankruptcy trade in Mexico. The scenario is a dangerous precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures for survival of companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the star-spangled banner, opposite view of international agreements.
A practical point of view, the blow to the judgment on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of bankruptcy for the district north of Texas, leaves the Mexican companies defenceless against the possibility of embargo their properties beyond the Great.
However, the resolution will allow the largest manufacturer of glass of Mexico to take the US Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the cause that creditors must register according to the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the fifth circuit, in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings is bankruptcy commercial formalised in Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the law Modèle United Nations International Commercial uniformity of the law was created to this end in taking the American Law Institute as arbiter.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intersociétés, recognised in the critical mass of bankruptcy, the commercial debts incurred by subsidiaries of fertilisation to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not be achieved.
However, the Mexican laws recognise this possibility.
In fact, the case of fertilization is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half-dozen of examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of bankruptcies Business had guarantees the debts.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since it was the votes of subsidiaries, all the ways the creditors of fertilisation who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the funds' vulture 'as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, have not obtained the majority.
The vote would have been to 45 votes against 37.
A given omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, fertilisation has been blamed for the difficult situation that it was running since 2008 without stop to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, reflecting the costs to the country.
For the moment, the society of the family González Sada interjettera appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of assurance will call for the non-prospérité and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.

Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes' The Basketball Championship is all my life '
The 'Hetin Basketball Championship globe-trotteur of the' Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the ground and, thanks to him, has travelled in the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of history of the local Basketball Championship also that of Héctor 'Hetin' Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain drain the condemns the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, that this is as a player lower leagues, the national team player, basketball manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as President of the basketball federation.
'I have been several hats in the Basketball Championship throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was chairman of the BSN, Director-General of the national team and President of the Federation' during the 1990s, remembers Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where it lies with Isabel, its faithful wife for more than 50 years.
'The Basketball Championship is all my life'.
Reyes am not exaggerating when he made this statement.
The walls of their homes, almost all décorés photographs and memories who recall its route out standards.
In the heart Bayamón
Of all its memories, those that we love most are those who recall its passage as player within the team of Vaqueros in the middle of the 1950s until 1982, after 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
'It has been my best years, those I have profited most because I had the opportunity to participate in the eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, either as a manager, co-manager or leader.
For many years of satisfaction, including the five disputed championships 1971 to 1975.
I then withdrawn during the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy entered the team of BSN.
From here, 'Cuco' Ortiz, which was a great administrator, has taken the lead of the team, 'says Reyes.
I recall that Gene Bartow, which had been leader here and which was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a strapping player for you, it is two metres.
You want it? '
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico.
Bartow am next recommended Raymond gausse, which has been naturalised and which was a better marksmen.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon win a championship, gausse would help us to try to win another.
It is pleased with the championship of Vaqueros gausse, but only to distance as in 1988 it was already the great manitou of the Federation.
At that time, it preferred to take advantage of its charges and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we have won for the first time the United States at the tournament pré-olympique of Mexico in 1989.
Secondly, there was the 1990 World, where we have reached 4th and where we have had to win the bronze if the judge Canadian we did not play the final match, said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best national team that you view?
It is part of the best, like that which has fought the Dream Team during the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite Panaméricains Games is that of Cuba in 1991, when we have won the gold and that we have put a kicking to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only comprising Mincy, gausse, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), there was also young people (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was unable to attend the world from 90 to cause a problem of its knees.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pré-olympique of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players as' Canito 'Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the mess in the Games Panaméricains Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
Its statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculín.
And this without taking account of its trajectory in the various leagues for which he has played.
That has been the best leader portoricain?
It is very difficult to say.
We have had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young, I very much like the work that fact Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest success in the Federation?
Have been part of the time the most glorious of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had until 17 teams in a season.
You have to do?
There are things that I wanted to put in place, as the regionalisation of minor categories.
For example, that boys of Pontius play only in their area and are only teams of other parts of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people are travelling and play too when it is not strictly necessary.
I have at least given the benefit of compulsory and qualifications for the leaders, the staff of ground and referees.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and, from time to time, I see Basketball Championship matches.
And, of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been my side.

But it was thanks to its authoritative interpretation of the despicable délicieusement J.R. that Larry Hagman began its greatest success.

The slogan 'Who killed J.R.?', invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotion in which the figure of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated of speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in betting.

It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) which had learned over.
J.R. had put House and was then threatened accuse prostitution if it does not left the city, but other people were also reasons of the attack.
Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a man corrupt and insatiable but the charismatic smile: an entrepreneur dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to do when his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be as epitaph for J.R", declared Hagman in 1988.
We should write: 'Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing'.
This is the only part that it has lost.
Victoria main, coprotagoniste of the number of original, has mentioned this Friday of Hagman as a man 'huge, both on the screen that in life'.
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans throughout the world, and in the heart of all of us who have had the chance to know and love.

A course on the 'Ending world' has just begun
Every week, the students investigate issues as the apocalyptic nuclear war, the zombis, the virus and the seeds and global warming.
This six-month period, when Professor of religion Stuart charmé has decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew he was casting a bait irresistible: the end of the 'great' Mayan count the timetable, on 21 December, which refer to many people as evidence of the end of the world.
But Professor charmé had no idea what the expected in the months following: Hurricane Sandy, a disastrous fiscal abyss that some have dubbed the 'own Armageddon debt' and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the theorists Christians in the end of time believed that whichever Apocalypse.
'I am not realised that this would be half the more apocalyptic that I have never experienced', said this week Professor charmé its students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyse what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we racontions, it has been a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the world.
And it is not the only Professor to give lessons on 'the end of the world' this six-month period, which will, in theory, the last of history.
To Temple, Professor deputy Barry Vacker exemption the 'Médias, culture and end of the world'.
Every week, the students investigate issues as the apocalyptic nuclear war, the zombis, the virus and the seeds and global warming.
'We are analysing this because these ideas are proliferating with the time,' he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyse films with apocalyptic issues and look at how they can be compared with examples of real life.
'I have tried to inform my students on what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,' said Vacker.
On campus main of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a deputy chief history of the Art and anthropological, have to give a course, simply entitled 'The end of the world'.
'We add' 2012 'for the possibility of giving the way to new, in cases where the world would disappear not ", declared Professor Restall.
Despite the imminent 'disaster', students to study, create projects and spend their final examinations.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be spent the eve of the Apocalypse, which should not leave the student choice but to work 'until the night of the end of the world supposed ", declared Restall.
Prices were quite popular.
'It has been complete in two hours', said Restall about its intended for students, composed of 35 students.
We have received messages by e-mail several weeks before the beginning of the term, the people who were there were still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that is one of the most interesting.
'This fascinates me to see what people are able to take comfort "says Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion, and sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, the University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because fear of the Apocalypse, whether religious or secular, is only a question of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in psychology and sick bay of 25 years, all states have watched the apocalyptic films.
'I had never heard of a way which taught this matter,' he said.
I appreciate.
But none of the students, and still less a professor said, we believe in the end of the world of 21 December.
'Our first draft was the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited', says Julie zegle, student of last year to Temple of 21 years and from West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit that there is anxiety linked to the Armageddon in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in those speculations.
'In other parts of the world, people do not believe in this', ensuring.
It is in the majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University The Salle which gives in the Philippines this year, has responded quickly when asked whether he knew that we gave here on 'the end of the world'.
'The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world', nous-a-t-il responded, as if it was an exception from a higher authority.
We have a result of the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, we spoke of the many dates supposed of reckoning, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, 'people will begin immediately to look at the next date' or to philosophise about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of the world will disappear.
Students and teachers are the date lightly.
Several we have said that they believed in to the parties' the end of the world '.
Sometimes, I call 'friends and we rigolons whole', said of Samira Ford, student communication of 20 years.
