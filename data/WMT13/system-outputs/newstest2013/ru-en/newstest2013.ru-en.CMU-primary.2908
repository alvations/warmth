The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
The leaders of the Republicans justified its policy to fight fraud in the elections.
However, in the Brennan Centre believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, the actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
In contrast to the Canadian American states are responsible for the organization of the federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, complicating the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only in a 2011 was 180 bills, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of the presence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, the right to take away the right to vote and voter registration in the day of citizens who have a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections no American states do not require voters to present an identity card with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state, which has such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities to spread the practice and the other states.
In the last two years they initiated bills to voters to identity card with a photograph, in 34 states.
It is important to note that in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have a universal identity, such as health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, there are 21 million people under the age of necessary for voting, do not have identity card with a photograph, issued by the state government body them.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012, does not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with a photograph.
But that is not all.
Students-voters, who are believed to vote for the candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph issued their educational establishments.
But these states are members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to be used for voting certificates issued by the club.
Until 2004, no state demanded evidence of the American citizenship for voting.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting from 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are US citizens.
Apparently, these measures aim to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws, the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who want to register.
This limitation is not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to contribute to the list of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to the fall of 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers adopted in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
However, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latest accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters.
The same thing happened and come from Latin America.
Presenting only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted ahead of schedule.
In contrast to the white, forming 76% of the voters, only 46% among voters ahead of schedule.
Of course, the Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose laws limiting the registration of voters.
A few draft laws was vetoing governors Democrats.
The most controversial laws was suspended with the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.
This allowed partly to limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring the charge of identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules came into effect, of course, hinder the implementation of the right to vote in the elections of 2012.
The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that were adopted, seeing in them the obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The report of the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, the actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, tests on the dog Lenegativnie sometimes erroneous results, and sometimes Lgepositivnie that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
The men, and so are reluctant to the Dispanserizazi, there is doubt even more.
The test or not?
We asked the opinion of the two specialists.
The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups, therefore the data is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to develop any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European found different levels of mortality for those patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place.
The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who have not passed screening.
So, I would recommend tests from 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The men of African origin also are at increased risk.
The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.
The cancer can be both aggressive and low-level.
The patient must explain the risks of his cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many men who have detected cancer, will not be held cancer treatment, because they are not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them an active surveillance, and if the disease progresses, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we define the exact criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
Thus, I would still be tested.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of passing the test the dog.

To prevent the disease.
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people are good enough to eat and move, 30% of RACO could have been avoided.
"If no one else smoked, the figure rose to at least 50%," says Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer are completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The public is associated with 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is a colossal damage to the health of the people.
"Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," says a spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
The promising fact: Ten years after the rejection of smoking risk died of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and colon, esophagus, pancreas and cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protect against colon cancer," added the association.
The food
The association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.
It is also necessary to avoid sausage.
Canned meat drying or smoking by Sasol, could lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The past can harm cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains the association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists engaged in the study of the vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies is not a single.
According to the SCC, the study of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another gave the opposite results.
In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of Vitamin D also is not complete clarity.
However, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family is important to discuss with a doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, a message that scientists may be able to discover the Higgs boson, caused a real boom-and not without reason.
It is believed that the boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing less.
Moreover, this is the latest particles, the existence of which was predicted in the Standard Model, our best, or in any case, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the conduct of the matter, but that has not been found experimentally.
But physics is not until the end of are confident that the question is about the Higgs boson.
We know, without the shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a new particle and that it strongly reminiscent of the Higgs boson, predicted the standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week for a major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems to be confirmed, although the full confidence of some data still lacks.
Imagine all that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to make a mistake appear to be minimal, and see what it means.
There is one law, in this world, the inevitable that the two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
But although the particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it is also one of the law of nature: the principle of Pauli, which postulates that the two particles could not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are one and the same "quantum state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
On the basis of this, the physics is shared by the two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called Ferionami who sensibly are subject to the principle of Pauli.
In another hustle bosons, the vile gangs of anarchists who have no respect to that, at least to this principle, that means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, quite extraordinary adventure Laboratory at Berkeley, the boson particle), in turn, divided into two groups: Meson, which we are here to talk about will not, "particles and forces," which are the main force of nature and that in some ways is the Higgs boson.
These are the boson, it should be emphasized, not all exotic creatures such as one might think.
Indeed, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an incredibly banal boson: photons, or particles of light, "which is a" courier "electromagnetic forces.
Indeed, when one particles with an electrical charge, accelerates or change direction, it "violates" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like the stone in a pond.
This "violations" of electromagnetic waves (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photon-and, therefore, one of the boson "vectors of power."
The more stable field
The same is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference is that in order to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs.
However, the field of the Higgs is much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to his excited to achieve very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond, the surface that could unsettle only a very large stones.
That is why it is necessary to huge particle accelerator, as that is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN-a ring with a diameter of 27 km! "to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful also for an explanation of the correlation between the Higgs boson and weight.
Indeed, not all particles and not all the materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, he never will be on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with a Higgs: those who interact are mass, while others (as a photon, by the way) it does not have.
So, what can bring all of these studies, "says Ms. Plamondon?
They are used to validate the Standard Model (CM), and it also allows physicists find a divergence between the results of the observations and forecasts cm.
In addition, some of them passionately thirsty to this divergence, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for a "new physics" and shut some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, is still flawed, offering no explanation for the gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the Universe (ouch-ouch!).
But so far at CERN such differences are not found.
The consequences
The benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person, it is more difficult to predict but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They envisioned their applications in science, but no more than that.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory Bell, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he developed the first continuous laser pulse (previous) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine ...
In addition, there may be a tool for accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light.
This sensor, although it wasn't his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all the world's digital cameras and deserved the Nobel prize for physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, indeed, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die ... | "debt"
The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate soon to be resumed, while at the same time preparing the bill.
Nevertheless, in this critical area much remains to be done.
"The debt tried to look closer."
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. also lived alone in his apartment in Monterey.
Prostate cancer, destroying it from within, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was five years old, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-GABA in Bel, where arrived the day before.
"But it is always shocking, it is impossible to prepare," he says. "
The disease does its work: the incredible weakness that does not eat yourself to go to the toilet and even myself.
Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he surrenders and agrees to help him to eat.
He Bodrits, even manages to smile, talk to strangers, who are working around him, bring him drugs by him in the bath.
The courage before the normal death.
"My greatest desire to cure for diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the staff found the cure for this malaise.
"During the life we teach that men should urinate standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage Victor-GABA.
Regress to the status of a child for some unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the ability of people to come to terms with the decline," he said.
According to the many people who are engaged in palliative care, important events Slucautsa and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are in palliative care orphanage Victor-GABA, all suffering from cancer.
The forecasts them to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more aid, called "healing."
Ms. A., 89 years, the most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to know their children.
"I have a good children," she added.
"I want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask to facilitate breathing.
She is still waiting in the coming days, the last visit to his son, came from Italy.
In the orphanage Victor-GABA with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with food.
This is the palliative care, which is when there is nothing you can do more.
In order to make the death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11,700 people are one place in palliative care institutions.
It is very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
For life goes on in the best conditions possible, "explains Dr. Martel is one of the doctors shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Dying we agreed to provide mouth rinse of brandy or Pepsi, that he will ask.
Diabetics we are no longer to control sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. H., who died last night.
On the morning of his son swilled down this beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We are helping relatives, as well as patients," says Nathalie Hussain, director of care.
In the orphanage Victor-GABA no one day does not look like the previous one.
A 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, situated on his pillow during a toast in his honor, tragically dies of a young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and Pereprobovai everything to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel concerned.
The 53% of patients taken at the shelter Victor-GABA, come from at home and 47% of hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, is to care, which is available to alleviate the suffering of the patients, included in the final stage of their lives, whether in hospital or at home.
And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-GABA and the society of palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.
This is a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of the law, legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, circulating a manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balurom Mantom and Dr. Bernard Lapantom and to testify about their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr. Cristian Martel, the health care system of Quebec is not enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before will be allowed to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, "I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists till the last day to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she told me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!
There is no powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death, thanks to the medical staff, for what they did not fulfill their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in the fight against the pain.
According to Ali Monroe, director of palliative care in the society of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anesthesia in 8% of cases.
At the end of his life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient is asleep until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
Impossible to pretend that we do not know more about these sufferings.
More and more patients who are unable to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from the pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want me to have euthanasia," it means, "I want to make it was easier for me."
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to the journalistic research grant from the Institute of Health Canada.
The large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec
The officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and experts of the Italian Mafia day by day tell what they know about the colossal "system", beset the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
"The industry," which is very costly to taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how this system breaks down after all the funds were put in the case, joked Jacques Deno, a lawmaker and former police chief Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a side of the results of the investigation of crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly.
"Deno report" established a direct link between the industry, the secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, only the Ministry of Transport would save billions of dollars on contracts," if some were their instincts to take a stake.
The commission Charbonneau "for the two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "uncover the scheme, behind the individuals."
The permanent division of the fight against corruption, created in 2011
To connect to create a permanent division to fight corruption in 2011, which entered a state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, members of the special unit "Hammer" after the 2009, which made "sewage cartels Montreal," Stop the overvaluation of the value of contracts.
Over the past weeks has made a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco Zampino and Richard Marcott-The mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
The queue-Gilles Vaillancourt, recently retired from the post of the mayor of Laval, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
It is suspected of repeatedly receiving a bribe older state orders.
In addition, the official indictment was charged several transport Montreal service engineers and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Sambito.
The latest detonated a real bomb, tell investigators about the "system" to obtain government contracts.
Within a few years, the Sabito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal, a mediator, linked to the Mafia, which, in turn, translate money party mayor Eralda Trembley "joint Montreal."
In the 2000's Sabito Soryl money to the right and left, he listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties, mainly the liberals, then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally collected funds for the Liberal Party of former deputy prime minister Nathalie Normand.
Sewer contracts, which increased the cost of
In Montreal "system of corruption worked without a hitch."
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described her details before the Commission: For ten years he received a gift from the construction firms, invitations for trips, golf tournaments, the restaurants, hockey matches and bribes in exchange for a total of 736,000 dollars in the sewer contracts, the cost of which he is too high.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received on his paw, increased account for 30-40% of using fake additions.
Then one of the organizers of the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr Trembley that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, fills the party ticket dirty money.
After these revelations of Mr. Trembley resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal rul was one of the first deputies in Montreal, raised the alarm.
The mayor of Rivière des PRRI in the east of the island, it faces a 2010 sale of municipal land, purchased for $5 million and resell for ... 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which in the end, it will be launched "pulling the plug to understand the functioning of the system, the crocodile ants to stop gangrene and identify the perpetrators."
This process it Harateresuet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but doing its own investigation team and observers, will be needed to avoid a return to dubious practices.
How do we get out of the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Deno notes for its part, that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially his concern about the role of "elected officials, who knew about this scheme," but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "They told me that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec offers limited to 100 dollars donations to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: "until we are not strictly limit the electoral expenses, the policy will be dirty money."
It requires a full reconstruction of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: "We cannot fall below; boldly into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this history and casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Deno calls for those who laughs, our own backyard ...
"Paris St Germain is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary range.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but could-and the new dimension of the Paris St Germain.
The profits of the great players.
Next to them I is growing every day.
The technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not getting.
From the beginning, the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF Clerontene and to my parish in St. Etienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you will benefit from the competition, Carlo Ancelotti ...
The new this summer not to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that such a player like me, wants to be on the level and laid to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my position.
He helps deputies, such as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position that I have.
Ancelotti is the master of?
Of course.
Ancelotti is the respect of all technical staff.
Today in the first league is not equal to him and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had with him was reassuring.
Then I away from a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has also explains to me my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season Paris St Germain?
In the first league leader Lyon took place for us.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is a Champions League: We spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take the return match in the one-eighth finals.
Whether Paris St Germain became the first European club in the short term?
He already has a budget ...
In order to become a major European club, Paris, it is necessary to win titles and the long-term positions.
Today, it is not so.
Financial Paris St Germain have the means to make the project viable.
Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are ardently wish to win this title.
Last season we were to close.
In May, it was frustrating, because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that the struggle for the title in the team, such as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expected too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We are fully ready for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find criticized for that, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed from time to time.
We have proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons fails to pass the one-eighth finals, although they also spent a huge amount of money!
Given the invested amount, we were on 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disdain for our opponents and to the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "wake up" this new Paris St Germain.
This shows how exciting the first league.
In May, I hope that we can smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the tasks of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, if they say that there is a "Slatanozavisimost."
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of head.
He came to this and he proves that he is the first Star League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
The group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did, it is really only.
This stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How do you have the Euro-2012 with the French national team?
Like a letdown.
I ardently wished to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me hitting a little playing time.
I saw there many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I can play good qualifier matches.
This is what I had hoped since my baptism the blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and should now behave exemplary.
What do you think about the first month of Didier Deschamps led by Blue?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is with the players and inspires the victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc reached its goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will blue in Brazil.
A good deserved a draw (1-1), pulled out on October 16 in Spain is at the heart of the match?
This match has given us the belief in themselves.
Each fought for all.
To this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

The course Bitcoina, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars, before returning to today by about ten dollars (courses indicated on the website of the bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report, published in October, the virtual currency interested in this system.
He describes Bitoin as "the most successful virtual currency," to compete with the dollar or the euro "and" similar to the common currency. "
Bitoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to promote the video game that made during the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
But the operation of exchange controls and the handling of any central authority.
The network Bitoin all nodes are at the same time holders of accounting books, auditors, currency issuers, Poupatelimi and sellers.
How is this network?
Each deal between the two users is really going on between the two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this deal, signed by the electron, using the double key encryption system.
The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that Bitcoini used in the transaction, there are in the public accounts book, sent to the entire network.
The step is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
She passes through the decision of the mathematical tasks, sent to computers, the central bank decided that as temporary, gets the privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the phase hashing file, that is a transformation of a large file in the digital signature, a short and unique.
Computers "are" a new transaction and add to her room, before hashed "all together."
The aim is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (of many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it correctly.
The transaction is thus Nerarsruvno related to the chain of all other transactions; any modification to change a digital signature.
If the user to see me very quickly (less than ten minutes would be willing to pay twice the topic, the money, the only one of these two transactions would have been vindicated by the network and the other would remain unproved, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer to the task, receives 50 Bitconov.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of Bitconov in circulation so limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one millionth that leaves more reserves ...
The complexity of the tasks also increases with the computing power.
The network has already experienced the ups and downs of life.
The websites, services generated were attacked, and Bitcoini were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect does not apply to the protocol," says Pierre NASA, which recently launched Paymium company payments real money using the network generated.
The ECB also reported about the possibility of money laundering through these anonymous service.
But the cash also possess this disadvantage.
The major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, allow them.
Recently, Dorith Ron and Adi Shamir from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book and found that almost 80% of Bitconov are not in circulation.
"The sell-offs were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Gospels Jon Holmquist, working in Coinabul, which is conversion Bitconov in gold.
Pierre NASA, the other author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential benefits of this technology as the operating network.
The system is the equivalent of the credit card, Paytunia (real money) or contactless payment through mobile phones, but it uses generated to verify transactions, thus getting cheaper.
The winner of the better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new device or software.
It is only necessary to address that can be photographed and recognize "the phone," explains Pierre NASA, worry that it already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before 2013 Bitcoin established, it will take some time, but can become a turning point," he predicts.
In his report suggests the ECB, incidentally, revise a variety of risks, is considered to be elevated, in the case of the success of this system.
We have gone from Afghanistan.
What's next?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa province and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not only on the US.
The US suffered mainly Afghan peasants, who are regarded as terrorists.
And we, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban, consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it was when the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, the old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I watched from the hills of almond trees due to the French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, would not be attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the invasion of the Taliban will not be in Kabul.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood on account of the struggle between different factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of freedom, the return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of these peasants, in which they surpassed Al-Qaeda, but the situation has not improved in our days.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants, returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.
They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even are not fought.
The people, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that was not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as leave those who managed to American generosity: the outflow of capital.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and the Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army.
The authorities, who will be to her commander, will be legitimate?
The old commanders, to lead the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial guards, who would not be subject to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, the country, with strong local differences should be decentralized, modeled on Western countries to some extent, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want to foreign control, especially before the election, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not put back on its feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system renovated.
All imported; nothing is made, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, the state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral resources.
This has only strengthened the feeling that Western countries were there, only to them.
Without the energy for processing copper or iron ore on the spot, without means of transportation to export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remains the biggest employers of the province.
It is also necessary to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The conclusions of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and follow the impossible task of assistance with offensive operations, "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, with a small French organization has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, the intensive involvement of the local workforce, could help stem the uprising: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, the restoration of forests, fruit trees, the protection of soils and an increase in the area of arable land.
What we will leave the memory of themselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, often very harsh in these valleys, located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for implementation of small agricultural work, coming from the local communities in Kapisa.
To get rid of the rebellion, led by foreign groups that want to farmers, as they told me, you need to provide them a small military support, which would be well controlled and came to him directly.
The birth of the constitution of Egypt
This is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is more than ever, on the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play in the bank.
The outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text of the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state provided the two additional months to finish the job.
It has been two years, as Egypt is based on the preliminary text, who introduced several amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal contradiction.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," while "the word" and "violates the law."
In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians, the article for the article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent raging across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
The more that the call for accelerated voting like the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "either you to vote for my, or I leave a emergency powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
The majority of liberals are not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to get his opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements arose around ... time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were not properly configured.
The text, which yesterday was vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, stipulates that "sharia principles are the main source of law."
The Salafi party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would enable them more strict application.
For 2009, the fact that this article had not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," meet the liberals, who see in this a PR.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the constitution is through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University advisory role, particularly in the verification of compliance with sharia law.
According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier, this is worrisome, because "people to decide, not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of a theocracy. "
In addition, many liberals, excited by the fact that the next president of the university, it seems to be much less moderate than the current.
"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, "is not the Ulema, and people with a university education, some training in the French system" reassures Alexis blah, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around the article 220 may be ambiguity, as used in her terms from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "Fiqh" [the Islamic jurisprudence, - prim Ed].
And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges are competent to decide about this. "
In addition to its religious aspect, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they were significantly reduced compared to what under the old regime.
Another moot point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held in parliament, and the National Council of Defense.
Also will not be denied the trial of civilians before military courts, despite the requests of the association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious consequences for the freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer talking about the protection of women, the BA Mora, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President was speaking yesterday evening on television, manifestations are scheduled today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The great and powerful" to Moscow oranges: migrants hoarding money on language
So far, deputies and human rights activists argue that the law of compulsory language testing, the country has already appeared fraudsters selling "fake" certificates
In Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come to 13 million workers.
For the most part of this citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money to support the families, remaining at home.
The law entered into force on December 1, according to which each migrant workers must be exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and communal services, and retail trade.
Eventually, however, the promise of the FMS, the tests will be obligatory for all visitors.
The dealer will not only the language, but the Russian history and the basics of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to, and to extend work permits.
The exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where Russian is the official language.
Do not conform to the law and people managed to get the certificates and diplomas on the creation of before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, doomed and the protection of the rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language name of Pushkin, the Peoples' Friendship University, University College and other Russian universities.
The tests migrants will be able to all cities; now opened more than 160 such centers in Russia.
The initiative of testing supported and deputies of the State Duma, and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, had asked many times in the press the question: what it is, in fact, this?
That will change to knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all to meet the representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "of slavery."
Very many talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representation of the FMS in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should start before their departure.
Only 90% of the organized recruitment system will allow to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems appear for migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I am sure Sebelev, the future of migrants is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of aid "for" putting him in a close Barak, where he and dozens like him will be months languishing without food and documents, induced by 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing, but by the arrival of their passport, select, not to pay promised salaries," confirms the head of the management of labour migration Ms Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Do not swear, Nasalinika!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, are going to work in Russia, acknowledged that not only do not know the language of the country, which seek, but also to write on their own.
Of course, it is not their fault, how much trouble: the few Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmen can afford to get even a primary education.
Even their families have nothing to feed the children, not to mention to them to wear, shoes and school.
Dorast adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.
It is difficult, if not with the knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and crippled."
However, in respect of the law on human rights defenders say one important point.
The test will be held only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the status is not there will be no exam, a subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of workers continued to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome to, or to Pravda."
Many of the newcomers argue that received the official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization of money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
This is false registration can be done quickly and for just 1,500.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizens of Tajikistan Umed Hukadamov.
"Gubarev, do not buy the painting."
In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that there are not only false migrant registration documents.
A "sham" certificates of the language tests already seized by the FMS.
The fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, hoping thus to facilitate the task of the tests, paid for the documents of the seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: It will cost three thousand labor migrants.
The fact that the main task of the soon-to protect the system from corruption, "peels" it was impossible to simply buy, and representatives of the authorities and human rights defenders.
Meanwhile, the government may have promised to guest workers, failed to successfully tested the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, the visitors who do not know Russian, will be offered work in the areas, not that active communication with people.
The interior ministry is not in the turnover of the illegal market weapons
The share of crimes using legal weapons is extremely small.
The Ministry of Interior of Russia offers to tighten the law against the owners of civil weapons.
This is the authorities' response to the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when without victims, and the massacre, the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, a press killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of Travatiki in public places and raise the age from which it is possible to obtain a license for the weapons from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea of the head of the Duma committee on security and corruption Irina spring and promised that the amendments in the law on weapons to contribute to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws."
The network has an open letter, the authors whose representatives of various public organizations are to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian forensic service of the BBC lawyer Vasily Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the ministry of internal affairs for the first six months of 2012 committed 142 crimes using firearms, registered in the Ministry of Interior, while 1168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons not puts criminals to go on the black market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the ministry argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
"The black market weapons is through several channels.
The main such channels five, says retired Colonel Victor Barantsev, ten years who worked in the structure of the ministry of education and the general staff.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "the army or military footprint," is a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in Chechnya.
"The weapons dragged and the Russian officers, and Caucasians," says Barantsev.
The guest of the "black weapons" stolen criminals have members of the security forces.
Barantsev explains that includes and gone from the police warehouses and stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
The illegal "guns" go to the sale of military warehouses.
Many of the military warehouses often the bombings.
"There is a proven version that part of the arson were made specifically to cover the shortage," says the former military.
His contribution, According to Barantsev, the weapons manufacturers.
"Now divorced private gun factories that are not able to withstand competition on the international market and thrown weapons out of the floors on the black market, including Moscow," the expert said.
Another source of "black-market smuggling."
A lot of pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There are its production, sometimes initially, and the Mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report in 2011 prepared a design center of the troubled analysis and public management.
The experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and service, the literature and open data portals on arms issues.
The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
"Half of the weapons on the black market was caused by the officials, whose work is connected to the weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons from places of armed conflict, 14% of cases are theft at the stage of weapons production, 5% of the "black archaeology."
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons shops, who asked not to call his surname, pledging that the guns, the black digger, has not been buying too old for a long time.
More often than not, as he says, the new party sellers go to the military warehouses.
Ensign person buys unit, for example, the gun volumes.
He discharged her pass through the fence.
"He carries it in the city and possible to sell 900 euros per with two shops," he says.
"However, the police in the course of all cases, therefore periodically when Burns plans for crimes, the purchase of traders have illegal weapons," adds a consultant.
"As in the luxurious shop."
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I did not respond sites, blogs, while comrade, who proposed to arrive at the platform "racing," where will the man who took me in the corner, "where we are."
The price of a barrel I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Barantsev
I need to get the barrel familiar, with an exit, "says the seller consultant." I have so familiar, but I'm not sure it.
Sellers in the markets, but there also needs to come conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter had a tooth out."
I now even a couple of Castetov out through the person, in which I am sure.
He also their supplies only to me, because I know that I do not pass it.
The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Barantsev has dabbled in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about this.
The scheme, according to him, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs, where "anything."
"I felt like in the luxurious shop," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barantsev, does not offer a pig in a poke-all you can try.
I, the potential clients, not just buy-we go with the seller in the forest, there is a target.
"I give the opportunity to shoot, convinced that the weapons beats a good start to bargain," the expert describes the procedure.
The shop on the couch
The Internet search engines are on the sites and groups in VKontakte, where offer to buy weapons for different purposes. "
This does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," wrote in the advertising cap on the site "to buy the pistol or machine."
Users leave their applications and asking questions.
A minor sell?
"Without a license, of course," asks users "Ivan" (The).
"buy volumes. Moscow" tersely formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The federal security service now Rasbrosila a huge network of decoy sites and willing to buy the weapons row a shovel.
People go hungry fish on Prikormu, and then coal mined in Siberia
The military commentator and former military Viktor Barantsev
I heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the actions of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through an ATM payment.
"In response to send a photo and instruction, where the hidden weapons," says a spokesman for the public organization "right to bear arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Barantsev argues that leaving the application on the site, it is possible to remain without weapons and get behind bars.
The federal security service now Rasbrosila a huge network of decoy sites and willing to buy the weapons row a shovel.
"People are going hungry fish on Prikormu, and then drill in Siberia coal," he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to meet the deadline in amount from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the right to bear arms, "Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will wait for a month and a half.
He is shipped from warehouses long-term storage by the middle of these warehouses.
According to the official statistics office, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia fell by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US fast food and supermarket workers go on strike
The office of McDonald's is up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, the America a wave of protests against low wages in department stores Walmart corporations and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" Taco Bell, "" undis "and" Kentucky Fraa Iken. "
So far, no one can predict whether this wave in the ninth wave or she is destined to become obsolete in the early stages.
Shares support the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to the modest wage increases that are ordinary workers Walmart and the system of fast food, the purpose of the protests is to create a trade union organizations.
So far this sector of the economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.
The 46 cents a year?
The campaign began last week, after a day of Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, the millions of street and sometimes accompanied a scuffle.
In this day of some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which around the world employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops of the Corporation, who is on a modest and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers Walmart come only at work.
The availability of Walmart and the range of goods made one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell-off, partly because few pays its workers.
The latter also complain about the heavy conditions, for example, the lack of trucks or handheld scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance, provided by the Corporation, spiking from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical worker Walmart, receive 9.5 dollars per hour, these costs cannot afford, they said.
The scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will Srednuu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost of 3.2 billion dollars.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salaries.
If Walmart entirely to wage growth on the shoulders of the buyers, every visit to the shop will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend some 12.39 dollars; more than now.
Proponents of Walmart a note that the protests occurred just nine states and the Corporation neither Maleaschego damage.
"Black Friday" continued on Thursday in its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day, and during this time of Walmart sold about 5,000 goods in the second.
A total of its cash machines produced in "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the Corporation Dan Fogelman argued in an interview left the site, the Huffington Post that Jobs left a total of "less than five" employees Walmart, and that the protest was just a "next-trick organized by her union."
"A free society!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their unit were not stores Walmart (in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no them here), McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even gives you sick and does not pay for honest work!
Jumein Williams, a member of the Council of New York
At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast-food restaurants with its increase, but not much time, and an average of their ordinary workers are in New York at 8.90 dollars an hour.
No one earns less them in this expensive city.
How can exist in New York on such money for me.
Once through McDonald's was almost a quarter of American teenagers who earned their largesse after school, living in this case the parents.
Few people saw in the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly in an interview with McDonald's, who complain that must live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.
On the other hand, the forum of the newspaper The Wall Street Journal hangs comments, whose author notes that the irresponsible childrearing, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.
The participants of the protest, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the fast-food cashiers and the chef system began to pay at least 15 dollars per hour, there are more than doubled their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that were created in the field of fast food trade union organizations.
American law prohibits administration to prevent and punish the activists of the trade union movement hindrances and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes his life.
But the union of fast food, it is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main is extraordinary turnover.
The holdouts
Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day meeting near the McDonald's near Times Square, where several local politicians were Democrats, in particular, the members of the council Jumein Williams, said: "McDonald's" says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he did not even gives you sick and does not pay for honest work. "
The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the candidate for the post of mayor of the City, Bill de Blasio, said that "we must all engage in support of the fast-food workers so that they have fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every New Yorker!"
How to characterize the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food sectors.
But it was only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which tens of thousands of people in New York are busy.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark the flames of the mass movement.
"Until the cheat the brain is medium."
Popular among fans of modern technologies of augmented reality in recent years has seen mostly through the prism of special glasses.
The first summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the relevant patent application filed and Microsoft.
However, the conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Aramom Sadi, it follows that the scientists of the company points-history.
Beckons the prospect of a manipulation of the virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
"Tell them, in general, what is your team?
"We are human interaction with machines, but at the same time try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While the great majority of humanity stuck at the stage of working with the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking his finger in them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox Kinect and sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without the Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting Gestove management.
"What is still waiting for us in the future?
"Despite the fact that Kinect suffered a interaction on a physical level, many still occurs on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of the information improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not yet very much.
We are trying to change it, working on a three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including the projective.
It is necessary to release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
First and foremost to draw these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"What do you think about the voice control?
The popular pieces, but don't overestimate it?
"It certainly is not a panacea, the question arises of privacy, because they don't always want to notify the others of his actions and intentions.
Indeed, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, the management of the devices in public places we thought we had a project in which over a gesture, but not over, and over such a reputation for being parsimonious short.
The gestures were not a camera, a wrist bracelet that registered movement of bones and muscles.
While he's a big, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of wrist watches.
But in general the future for the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
"This is how?
"For example, how do you ask me to give you that the Bank of?
You say and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
"You want to force the users to adapt to what may or may not be at the moment the car?
"do not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow more precisely determine the reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution on depth, it is very important.
"If you're talking about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, what you have claims to the modern cameras?
There are not enough permission, the depth or something?
"In principle the current generation is that you can start in our work on a three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 to/from.
But it is not in the megapixels, and the quality and depth.
The latest point of view of all the current technologies are not good enough for us is adds to the work of designers algorithms.
That is necessary to remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y and Z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The man is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to/from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betses of our Redmondsko laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable processing-from 1 to 100 milliseconds of latency, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60).
Do not understand how it affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not a touch to FPS was great.
And the number of cameras increases do not need?
In the Kinect now there are three cameras, one of which is actually-IR radiators, and the second receiver reflected a signal.
And now the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...
Or aggravate it, increasing the required amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible Kinect counterpart, play with the curvature of cameras and see how this will help in the 3D definition.
"As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their points.
You do not think that from the point of view of the use of augmented reality goggles is one of the most promising platforms?
"Of course, all the time around, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very comfortable, but that's what I think: the steep option would be a" rolling "augmented reality when, on the basis of cloud platform you could switch from points on the smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.
Points is a very personal device in the their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time the weakness is a reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects with others.
"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony Stark of" iron man ", but a simple mortal.
There is a problem, which often indicate critics such ideas: there is no tactile feedback!
The arms did not feel anything!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
In his lectures, I often say that a reality is the seventh such a breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think, the eighth may well be supplements of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting trick-Use of second hand as a background for the image.
It is a pressing!
But there is a technology that is aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" tactile feedback, for example, interference several of ultrasound beams at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but it is a very weak as if you blew on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers is also promising direction.
"And you try to cheat the brain?
To make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
"This is a good idea, we have not yet tried to do so.
Here is another challenge, which will have to fight for a long time is how to make the person, physically located in the very limited to believe that he is open, almost infinite-work and the concept of cross-country tracks (not moving platforms, such as the Club), as well as the huge balls.
While cheat the brain is medium, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on a virtual reality research is attractive for many things in its infancy.
Rosbalt Vkusovishina instead of culture. "
"Rosbalt" continues to project "St. Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the citizens who are ahead of us at the forefront of culture and art.
At the top of the list are bright figures art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the Russian fame.
The new hero of the "Rosbalt" Epatagnia artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller-bearded man dressed all in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashion scene and exhibition.
Pictures of Kirill Miller always collect crowds, no matter where they were.
Kirill Miller is one of a St. Petersburg socio-philosophical Skazonikov, the creators of the new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a man of St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Moreover, he is a man of the city, with the advent of the streets of the city, raising the whole mood to smile.
He recently in the hands of the took about and became St. Petersburg Sarmanishikom as ripe for this complex role of all of its bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why do you still go around the city around the red, not in the yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose the color red as a fashion designer who view and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the artist, the image and society.
Although the society, all that gray is not a little aggression and malign properties.
But my provocations are aimed at to the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
"And when you realized that there should be an artist?
"The exhibition in the Nevsky, where they were exposed to my work.
I realized that it is my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists has passed a new, free like me were unintelligible.
I became friends with a new wave of artists, with Postgazonevishinoy that led to the "Pushkin 10", and there was no more waves.
I throws in the theatre, the clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words.
"And all this together in your art clinic ... it was important for me to be in the center of St. Petersburg, where should gather all the best creative forces.
In 1995 I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic bohemian club, Bohemian Club, the home of the St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: prize, tequila-jazz, remember the cord led the project "the ear of Van Gogh."
The cord and his friends sang under plywood light, they were in tight tights, among them was the current fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band play live, she became the "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to al-Khali-Galivski times.
We gave them system, and went to his great career, a basic education and upbringing he we have received.
"Dr. 137 club," gallery Griboyedov is the echoes of the art clinic.
Our employees and the patrons are gone.
I hero of the century, when the culture is something significant.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "the people of our city."
In the nomination "artist of the year" was named I ended my climax.
The new times by the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a person of the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and the popularity of the split, can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your work is recognizable manner.
"Many of my picture is hits, they clearly expressed the relevance and acuteness.
I will have the programmatic exhibition, "the Russian Museum in a clown."
The clowns-timeless category.
I used to social was now be so is a painful and scary.
But the clown all, the tragedy is smeared.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, the rescue of the world by the totalitarian changing in Pricasnom order.
Now, the clothes are guided by foreign mechanics, rather than on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand and who are not in a spat.
And deception will be filmed with the help of changing.
"Recently we saw you in the role of his city. - The Cultural City should have such a hero.
Who, like me, they will be.
"Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful?
"Now the commercial art should be careful, considerate, sweet.
The disintegration of the cultures.
Earlier, the people pressed in the pack, Bohemians is loved, the other.
Now all crashed on Microsoobschestva, it is hard to enjoy it all.
I am not a piece of paper to all.
Now we need to think who will be like.
Now each of the cult hero of 100 fans.
"And the Stas Mihaylov comes on several thousand!
"It come Brosenki, Seks-social sphere is there.
The cultural soil of 300 people will come, and 10,000 will not come, and as a result, the less management, money, everything dies.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive, do not spoil their.
I as a young man wrote such pictures that one collector they were hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse the concepts.
They say: "The culture of spiritual culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from other opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew by examples of the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused to money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I'm for such a culture.
"Kirill, lacking Petersburg?
"good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: Officials from the culture.
But not every one of them can be engaged in the culture.
Under the right of all is not so it was, the Kings, could not really understood in culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow now good consultants.
We have in St. Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are closed, as are higher experts who will appreciate these experts and give them the right way.
Now thrives Vkusovishinka.
The same Erarta, but what distinguishes them is that they honestly say that not all the modern art we accept, there are artists who should seek to other museums.
"What is for you-St. Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more there is soil.
And on our stones art is difficult.
We need a cultural soil, and we writers now have more than readers, it is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people who go to exhibitions, concerts, curious.
We have this layer of signals.
We need to make a fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented at the expense of the grant of St. Petersburg
Born in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with the asteroid is a murderer.
A caravan spacecraft with earthlings on board the search for a replacement of the planet.
In order to save mankind, the question arises, how to continue of its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two of the planet that it is possible to at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said a senior researcher at the state K. Sternberg Astronomical Institute (GAI) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions more suitable for life on Mars, the so-called surface of Venus temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitude or the orbit of Venus ... in space.
The approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with Flora.
Half a century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then the orbit of insects, the tiny fruit flies-fruit fly.
In 1979, the space sent eggs quails to check, as the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get the exit is absolutely normal chicks.
And then the problem.
"The problem with the fact that the chicks should find support, he should stand on its feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sycheva.
Not finding support, the chicks are tumbling.
After 10 hours in newborns was full atrophy of instincts.
The chicks not to react to light and sound.
And then there was the trouble is that, after four days they just died.
"and twice we Viluplali chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible there to work with them," the failure of an experiment with birds in space Vladimir Sycheva.
The last time the law biological "Minikoveg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, the Biosputike "Bion" will only same-sex species.
Experiments with rats, who was sent into space since the fruit.
In principle, there was nothing supernatural.
"It's just was Biosputnika, but again it is a unique experiment, and such research must be carried out," says Vladimir Sycheva.
After the landing of the space rats have offspring.
But to approach the problem of breeding directly in space until it.
No easy task.
The animals, losing, the usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
The man, unlike Swerusek, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create consistent emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not conducted.
But the women in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova's.
And the most precious thing that have humanity, is a female body.
Our Chaika flew, and nobody on earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space.
Will it be able to give birth to a child after the flight.
"It's a question that nobody answered," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitsky, twice the orbit and even to work in space, was born the son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little units are cosmonauts, who have after a long flight all cost, and is a healthy generation.
"And if more, then it is dangerous even the orbital flights," concludes a cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, the hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of Russia.
And yet, mankind to look for any new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
Girolaboratoria the CPC is a stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If the adult water, and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants-native elements.
The small Itiandry if confirmed, the life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that the baby is approximately nine months mother in Okoplonoy fluid, then it is easier to get to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing is just two weeks.
"It is a very little to something," says instructor Grudnikovogo swimming Marina Aksyonova.
In a word, if a child of weightlessness more than the natural state, for women is the necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, the ability to push the fetus.
Okay, lowered and it is relying on stimulants of activities.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go on the list, pushed it.
"And then what?" asks a trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.
Feeling of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn orbit is impossible, as an adult, dressed in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what would be vital.
"And this experiment, we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we bring to the ground a fully Desadaptirovannogo person," the head of the committee on bioethics YBP Ras Igor pest.
While the birth of children in space is a matter of the theory.
However, the time it will be a reality when the Earth on their ships to the faraway planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.
The head of the security audit department: checking Schwartz system failed due to the fault of the politicians.
In the field of government procurement and the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the supreme security audit management, of an interview for the site Aktuálně.Cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, that, in my opinion, we do not have," commented the current situation Kala.
Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German regulators.
As an example of improper practices are Petr Necas's approach to the so-called Schwarz-system.
The prime minister recently said that the Civic Democratic Party (FOC) will not disturb the entrepreneurs check-out it is forbidden or allowed?
"The law should be in any way, and if he does something, the prime minister could not resist the work of the institutions that required to check and to achieve the commitments," concludes Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which was the procurement laws of both countries.
What was it?
The meaning is the test that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question that the European legislation claims, how should the government procurement, the national legislation and then also in practice.
The information was collected, and even the still unfinished, revealed some interesting differences is to put it simply, we may have "the exact legislation and unmistakable," but in practice we on some parameters to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.
And as the project can help you, what does it mean to you?
This is a joint control can contribute to efforts to stop the laws, the reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to positive results.
The economy means to obtain the appropriate things for a reasonable price (but not always low) to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we achieve this by reducing the restriction orders.
Perhaps this system fulness "papers," so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restrictions had not declined.
You talk about the internal problems of the practical application of the law on government procurement.
And as a system of control in Germany?
Is there such organizations as our Kru (security audit management) or is it works differently?
As for the institutions, there is the quality of our Kru the Bundesrechnungshof, arranged by our principle, there is also a board, which operates a little differently, but mostly both institutions are similar.
In addition, the powers are similar to some extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of the audit and at the federal level in this way their system is different from ours.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have a state means.
The public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the Bundesrechnungshof level.
As for the local legislation, there is much easier than us?
Indeed, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take for example, but you cannot say definitely that it is all better.
This is so, because they are better able to manage control?
Definitely not, I repeat, I don't like this kind of comparison.
But it is necessary to say that even a model country faced many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If we are talking about the domestic legislation, as reflected on your institution amendments to the law on government procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it was still not in our efforts to control.
As we control in fact, it is necessary to consider some delay.
We take this into consideration only in the process of future inspections, we have started to use our new tool "risk Neconomnosti detection," through which we are almost 14,000 government contracts. we analyzed them. there is, of course, these changes will be, because they are a-changin restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or additional strain on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope, it is confirmed.
The problem that may arise, "the rule is that" it will be impossible to observe.
The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with supplier (for example, the regional operational program with the regional council) that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in such a case to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think that in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And while out of this situation?
Let us realize that the path will lead nowhere. "
The prime minister recently said that the FOC will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. what does it mean?
"Schwartz system" is prohibited or permitted? "
The law should be in any way, and if he does something, the prime minister could not resist the work of the bodies, which is obligated to check and to seek commitments.
One can say: "We have to change the law and allow it," but this is not to say that we pretend that nothing is happening.
The government procurement law contains very strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of the formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, in my opinion, we do not have.

Shimon Ornst: at concerts we want to accumulate the positive energy
What do you think about that less than a month should come to the end of the world?
This is just one of many alarming news that we, the people, so easy to get.
Together with a group of the tap tap we are constantly joking on this subject and say that we are the only team in the world that will be able to muster the positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you tell us more about the readers?
We are talking about a national fundraising event, that we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, the end of which declared on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before the event, on December 20, at 21:00 parallel start three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They are exhausted, roughly speaking, at a time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the timezone on 12 hours before the end of May, we have the calendar.
Who came to the head of this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, we all up together with our artist Gonsoy Augusta.
In addition to that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public, the one in the condition of the world we pass to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May the calendar we have created a unique collection of objects from shoes, T-shirts, bags and the original key against the doomsday. these things can be bought at the site www.e-tap.cz and thus also for US support.
The group is the tap tap together with other musicians also sang the hymn against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
It is already fancied listeners YouTube anthem for these Benefisni concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will be all right and the end of the world will not.
His sing all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
Hymns at the same time the trumpets also live on Czech television.
The words to this by wrote and played the role of Jesus in video Tomas Ganac, participates in the performance also Xindl X. ..
How do you started to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.
We actively to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, it is interesting for them.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for free educational centre studeo, now in its sixth year we are working with the civil association of tap at the Institute of Elicki.
School teachers regularly students of the Institute of Elicki and with them fun and interesting activities.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the lecturers, and we are trying to give them this opportunity.
In the framework of the additional construction of the Institute of Elicki in the future there will be a separate building, in which we move with this project.
At every concert will be a musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will attract all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens Illustratosphere with Dan Barth, the tap tap, Marjan Bangguo and Jiri dry.
All the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grandiose event" in the future?
For the first time in May was speaking at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would gladly have a representation of the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the US, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with expensive from the point of view of organization and logistics.
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchair, the stroller should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with instruments.
Nevertheless, so far to deal with it without problems. The Czech Airlines Čsa and British Airlines and British Airways have always been great for us prepared, I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes toward the handicapped and so on.
What you have to date?
After the Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is better than we have in Russia, we have seen that the east is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow is very many barriers, and here is still in the new independent movement of people on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also there is not a banal things, such as give way to a person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are organizations that are trying to draw the attention of people to the problems of people with disabilities.
And that, on the contrary, we constantly to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation, always depends on the efforts of those people who is concerned.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that people with severe disability move on the streets, can go to the toilet, the museum, yes anywhere ...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in public life, in the US with the tap tap a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or Besbariernost is one thing, but at the moment when we are well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really began to change.
So far this individual cases of people with a strong will.
A group of the tap tap at the moment is very popular, but go back two years ago that in 1998, you made it?
I entered the Institute of Elicki as educators around me there was a lot of young people who wanted to do something.
And because I am a musician and play including the saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.
Well, over time, as our leading LA Angels, says it is a little bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity came only in recent years, something confused?
It is true, it helped us that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, essentially as if he does not exist.
Thanks to the means of the European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
It was well in front of you to turn the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things to imitate one another.
This is logical, all the new is accepted with caution, and lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, it is natural ...
But the pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not to suffer and all abandoned personalities, which we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and developing, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something it turns out, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.
Whether the success of what you are, what do you think?
If we want to do the job properly, we should be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they should know that twice a week to go to the rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose the enthusiasm.
But it is in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the group of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them was at the beginning in 1998?
Only one LA Angels.
We are open, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m. on Thursday.
The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium in the club Fléda-Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava-in the centre of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities are bridges at the moment of the execution of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The purpose of the project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for a multifunctional free equipment for educational center studeo at the institute Elicki in Prague.
A ticket to the concert is worth 400 kroner for children up to 12 years free entrance tickets can be bought in advance Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former eastern bloc countries after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years actively participated in a number of projects of the agency.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights in space, but it is not always met with understanding.
I would like to remind you, for example, on December 6, 1933, lectures A. Sternfelda who represented in Warsaw the astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "introduction to the space."
The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only doctor Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, France Sternfeld won Robert Hesnault Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsch prize for the "introduction to the space."
Dr. Yang Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space.
He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote several books devoted to this scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became known to the world Cosmonautics propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated by including the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway inspection, equipped with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear even for acceleration or braking trolley was supposed to be used for missiles.
The information about this Dresine known only from the press of the era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about an Arrow missile.
The study section of weapons in cooperation with the professors Mecislavo Volfe and Gustav Mogickim.
The remaining materials shows that the study reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops works were interrupted.
In 1937, the specialized press the idea of photovoltaic fighter missiles that offered engineers Rogozinski, and the next year to work "air missiles, torpedoes and air rocket-bomb author Lelivi-Kivoblockogo."
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects the military use of missile technology was temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the job.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of his work ended because of the start of the war.
The scientific work, dedicated to space, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 "problems" magazine, which published four-dimensional articles on astronautics.
One of them professor M. Saturday suggested organized society, which will be engaged in space.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (of) to join the international federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of her member.
In the next year, the first chairman of Kazimierz Sarankevic (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
On this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, of a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missiles, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 M, was about 80 cm in length, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, the improved version of the RM-1, and was built in the summer of 1959 at Bledovsko wasteland were testing two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was about 1.4 metres in length, and its weight is about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was able to do this scientific work-rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was overseeing tall wind.
But in 1962, the further development was suspended.
The heir to the first missiles RM became a meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as two, its total length was 510 cm and the initial weight of 32.5 kg.
There are three types of (identified as a meteor-1, -1C and -1C) that the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The meteor-1 missile has a space of 0.4 L, meteor-and meteor-1s, 1B-0.34 L-0, 62l.
The maximum range of all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 in aircraft Institute was the development of the missile Meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missiles with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring useful cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of the meteor-2N and Meteor-3.
It should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and the creation of the national committee of the COSPAR two years later.
In addition, the framework of the programme Interkosmos, Poland, participated in the research of outer space on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermaszewski became the second Interosmonavtom after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision has provoked a lively debate in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at this problem from a broader point of view.
The liberal-oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is connected with the principle of free trade and free, not restricted the movement of private capital with untamed financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor force (wage) is the price of tension.
Under this concept should understand the condition of the producer through the delivery of cheap goods to persevere in economic competition that "is" the cost of rival to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their income.
On a massive scale, the means for the majority of entrepreneurs or transfer of production abroad, either cheap purchases abroad or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in the countries where the cost of the labor force, compared to other high.
The private capital assumes no social responsibility, including and made them unemployment, are the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation strengthens the unwillingness of the Masters entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social damage done in pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known, that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
The Cavalier methods of private capital to create at the level of the economies of individual states where governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, the government give its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This reflected primarily in the changes of the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force its people to obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the rich and poor.
In Germany for several years there is a public distribution of products to the poor, who are not in a position to feed their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching one million.
In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy are constantly cases when employed people such a salary, states that they must pay to get the subsistence level.
The scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
The economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same as in which people are under pressure from the catastrophic fall or social status, forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or there is a poverty-level wages on the outskirts of society, in the hope that private investment capital will come sometime in the country.
However, the question is, where he will?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, poverty moved from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans still works for a share of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of their own, that managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not manage actions to intervene in the economy.
The following answer the question is not whether the private capital, now almost managing policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?
The answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all countries.
As a result we have unrelieved situation of corruption, providing mutual benefits, the law, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Ministry for a lack of financial resources to the development of the private legal firms that are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills claims the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the western-style constitution, and the financially-powerful groups, for their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy in such a situation as it is now quickly described Appiano in the work, "the crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has been disintegrating and institutions are engaged in the violence.
The bribes, illegal to obtain favours with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls to elect a pre-sold voice "... decent people did not run for office of the state in the end, once for the eight months left without the consul" .. .. "seriously started talking about is that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need for a vigorous man .. Appianus thought that it would be" Pompeii, but it was Caesar, who has replaced the democracy on the autocracy.
As in ancient times, the modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital has already in essence is not intended for use in the public order.
The current result is not different from the past: the unprecedented decline in the elite without any efforts to reform a deeper.
It means that the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should seek the reckless liberalization of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a Liberal-style democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.
It is particularly tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are seeing now, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition on both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus the trend is a systematic character.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's share in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in the society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"The violence will not and can never achieve anything," Sting "Fragile", where the main verse refrain are the words: "Don't forget what we are fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, they would not be" moribund Gutel Naper, the wife of Meijer Amel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has many responses.
Some are for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the state of Israel, genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these recurrent waves of killings of criminals, and whoever the victim, at the end of the day, the current Israeli citizens, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnessing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers to peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve of 95 years of tension (the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
Every time we can find the same of Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently take their own steps, or for their throne was someone who guided their actions to advance its goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and the power of one of them could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as the head of the octopus (I do not know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop rumors linking them with a criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and that always led to strengthen their power, wealth or simultaneously and in addition, and to another.
They are big shareholdings in almost all the world's central banks, and against the countries whose central banks they do not have its share of war, they are or prepare (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5, after the overthrow of the Qaddafi remained only four, but at the same time, the Russian government assumed the Central Bank of the country into their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for Rotildovskim Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (understand-government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was killed in 1963. MP Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development plan of three world wars, the Great Mason 33-level Albert rations.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to around 0.5-1 billion people (of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be nothing, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method, with the help of a working group of the richest families headed by Rothschild, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao-order out of chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by killing the Hapsburg heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the imperial Russia, inaugurating the Bolshevik Revolucii.
The first world war ended in a sudden, forlorn warrior and economically surrender of Germany (there was no longer necessary war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the separation of central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the launching of the second world war for bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation imposed on Germany, the huge war reparations that created the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then just had tossed the Germans a strong enough, denouncing the perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, of inciting the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds provoked by the Zionist movement, one of whom sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration to create the conditions for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler himself from chains in which it initially held bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations on the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed in order to create a war.
If international bankers manage it unleashed, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of people at the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to global power?
It is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like the US, international bankers Podsovivat people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is a typical example of the fascist Hawks, loyal international bankers politician, do everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...) will be threatened to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait of Hormuz, a 20% of all the world's oil supplies (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), as well as to lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light now are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a common crisis, and the people of the new world order."
The new world order in their view is the World masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, enjoy the comfort.
A world where everyone was born body at birth implanted a chip, with whom he is under total control.
"and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have on the right hand or forehead on the stigma, so that the people who are not marked the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
That is the wisdom: every person who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For his name to the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.

In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students, the demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who was the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation is not expected she could not afford to throw Shah overboard, because it is at the root of could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, Sregessirovannia actor Ben Affleck "Argo describes one of the episodes of the history of America, which brought a small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy of six workers managed to escape.
After the complex twists they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, helped extravagant legends cover, according to which they rode on a Canadian passport as members of the crew, looking for a place to shoot a science-fiction epic in the country.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the "evacuation" of Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was reliable, in specialized magazines was about the film project, organized a press conference, the fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film is based on memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film Affleck is a special combination of genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "- Kinoops film, the story of a successful enterprise, fraud-example could be a number of films about the friend's 11.
The film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes of Tehran (credits shows significant historical photos of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the film "the big differences in this is not).
On the other hand, the light Hollywood fragments, the irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies are men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating table, the stairways institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck is managed to make resets career.
The ridicule of actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Argo his third feature film after dark detective" Gone Baby Gone "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).
At the same time it was the first movie directed by Affleck, who is not in the hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere place when this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is in an "Argo," where Tehran "plays Canada."
The best scene in the movie are on the streets, the reconstruction of real events-the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy of impressive its clarity, which also transmits the emotions of confusion and unpredictable that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are scenes of fictional (fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply a number of exciting cinematic scenes.
He is quite successfully works with a little, sometimes there is something to imagine it is not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America to prevent the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the rush on the runway look pretty far-fetched).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the necessity to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues is really very charming, but their characters deserved more space, and they are not only in the film.
The film, Affleck lacks a little dramatic, the movie is that you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style, the thriller Seventies.
But it takes hard.
However, it is enough for a reminder of the one still live in a sense of history, as well as for evidence as exaggerated notions of omnipotent and omniscient services.
The rules of the balloons, bananas and the circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com every year, the survey of the most absurd banking fees, now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd decision or project of the workshop of the EU."
"We are journalists to this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of the large European companies," said "law" the organizers of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the already nominated by the nomination the absurdity of the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to the premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women had benefits on life insurance, the insurance companies they objectively are less at risk.
"Further ideas from the shop, the EU people can nominate the contest before the end of the year.
The voting will take place before the end of February 2013, "Nager said.
Among the controversial orders of the EU, for example, and compulsory adding bio-fuel that as a result of the harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substances, or directive about the size of cages for hens, resulting in significantly tightened eggs this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "Buterbrodne butter" or from the sale of traditional light bulbs.
The high-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veto is the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union must reach 14 cm long and did not dare to exercise "abnormal curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only the existing piecemeal national rules, which made trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some countries, yet softened standards of fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that the existing directive would lead to Rastoceni products.
A candidate to win in the survey and last year's ruling of the EU, according to which sold balloons should be a warning that children under the age of eight years can't inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to the American Research, in accordance with balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, which prohibited blowing a fair Dudeli.
Funny ideas are born and at home
The absurd is and regulations regarding the European officials: anyone who has any official position in the EU, cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, using the name of Macedonia, and should instead "FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia)."
The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez-faire), suggested for the voting, in addition to several above these absurd rules, for example, the rules of the EU about the amount of food in the membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that may be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for what she faced a fine.
The questionnaire also interested in and ideas to pay some countries for what they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies on allegations of receiving subsidies.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have the sea.
The European Union will ask about compensation, "said in the autumn of 2004, the then agriculture minister Jaroslaw Palace (CSSD).
As the argument, he pointed out that the country was high grain yield, and as a result, the so-called intervention buying state had full warehouses of stocks, which had to be removed.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace, had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went into the Czech Republic, a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for subsidies offered villages of the ministry of regional development, the minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies must go to the compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: the bizarre orders are an exception
Although the regulations in the member states easily become an object of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is Erpanie subsidies of the EU projects that do not have even a hint that something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have been discussing the budget.
It is the emotions among Czechs and the fact that as in other countries of the European Union in Brussels, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomouc curds," but "Tusemsky Roma, whose traditions in our country has its roots in the 19th century, our manufacturers must have been renamed the" tuzemak. "
Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, instead of sugar beet.
The EU's official list of registered products, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "Parma Ham or Gorgonzola," Maripanom from a German Luebeck, have already been dried, for example, Karlovy Vary, Pogorgelicky and Treboniskiy carp and Saaz hops.
A trademark of the EU can also be proud of Pardubice carrot and Gorickie tubes.
People want me to spare the republic, but I am an amateur, "Okamura said.
Mr. senator, as a man who comes to mind to run for president?
I don't think about how to become a senator or the president himself.
If we had all functioned without problems in the country, then I would not stand.
But I can't see how countries stolen over the last 20 years, as people here tend the thieves, raise taxes and the retirement age.
I have had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like to try to find a solution how to change it.
And since I was 40 years old and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, except for the post of senator or the president.
In the Senate, you are, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you turn thus back to the people that you choose?
I said that all the time to get involved in the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
Later I said that if I am elected senator, I will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can make their views.
So I have the greatest influence and a wide range of powers.
But the problem is not just that we as a nation to grumble at the bar or TV, but at the same time are ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
This added to the media that the person who confuse the freedom of speech and vilify the freedom of lies.
For example, they told me that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek.
Get to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the idea of the material and criminal liability of politicians and the inverse property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To accomplish this, it is necessary to change the law.
You as a president of such powers is not, and only a the Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbying to conduct tours of free enterprise, it was advanced.
The problem is politicking is when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and discourages citizens.
As an independent non-partisan person I have a much greater potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party Rascladivania in good order, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and to apply it.
You consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or the left?
The Czech point of view, it seems to me that my people are more likely to the left.
It is not important for me is a little to the left or slightly to the right.
For me, it is important for us to go forward.
The question is not that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite the people.
I always support any good for society, it will offer the Hrcm or the FOC, and I'm just going against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says that you populists.
But do you prove that you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, please feel free ideal targets and views.
And you are trying to get closer to it.
Call this populism, but all the proposals, I'm talking about, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of parliament you will remain just a slogan.
And with this in politics, you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement a criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other opportunities.
Only to politicians, journalists and the public and trying to entice them on their side, so that we have achieved.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to organize direct television broadcast, in which I refer to the chairman of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And in case of refusal, they will be told why it does not want to.
If there is a strong person who voiced the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president is the merit of public pressure.
I speak directly, that I'm a fan, and not a genius and not intellectuals.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for its program to try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it does not succeed, six years to finish and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that one I do nothing, so I bypassed a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Raimu Nure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
At least I also supported a leading investigative journalist Yang Lorenov that revealed fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because people were dissatisfied with, but now I feel the weight.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went to chose the representatives of the establishment.
We are independent in the Senate only two.
The people have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be hard.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of their own party?
I have not yet thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential supporters, and I do not have the money to do so.
There is no money and the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You do not have the money?
You talk about the property declarations, and how is your own affairs with it?
The personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague apartments worth approximately 25 million, 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by approximately 10 million, Aston Martin at 3.5 million and the Skoda Superb million, and a few million.
The Aston Martin I have appeared, because it was my first dream is that I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was gallant women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You on Aston-Martin, own property 60 million and you do not have the money to the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but does not want to invest their own money especially in this.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have a 15 million on the campaign.
I have to get the debt?
The campaign I've already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I do not have sponsors, suggests that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
The cost of the campaign I essentially cover the senatorial salary.
But the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to earn money, so they would not stand.
This means that you will be engaged in business, it is possible to live?
Don't you say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced its activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like, that I was Bessrebrenniko that will keep the Republic.
But I also want something to live.
How much as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month?
From two to four hundred thousand that get further.
And if I became president, then its business would be finished.
The full interview you will find in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "right."
The architects MVRDV argue that these adventures are not only in the imagination is the example of Spijkenisse and its recently built a book of the mountain-2 Photos
"It seems to me the building is fun, it looks Futuristino, finally we have again seen something interesting," says Lisette Veraig, passers-by at the edge of the road.
Stefan Permon, an IT specialist at the nearby large enterprise, says: "No, the building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: Why us today is another library?
All have the Internet, the iPad and electronic books.
Now nobody is voluntarily in such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, Maloprimeatelnomu bedroom town near Rotterdam, holds the unique record.
It has a population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and built seven fictional bridges that are depicted on the euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library!
Blame the Maas of Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar graphs and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, took to task with his usual unflappable and appeared on the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smirk on his face.
While the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, defiant Maas abdicate from its original gift Piramidu in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "the book Mountains in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain value of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, "the book of the Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the contest "the best Library of the Netherlands in 2012."
The plan also participates in the Dutch national contest of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not suggest anything, in addition to the postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of the plant was richer for a piece of modern architecture.
But the main thing is the first in the history of this town of Spijkenisse appeared in public building cultural destination.
The long road to book
The first impression: the Eldorado under the cap for the cheese.
Only one elevator, held in the heart of the mountains, because the real aficionados of architecture and reading will explore the area on foot.
The glass from all sides-bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and stylish street lamps unmistakably create a sense of public square in the city.
The urban environment recreated perfectly.
The views unwittingly looking for benches, dogs and playing football in the boys and girls.
And everywhere-books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelves are located along the facades, in the middle of the big dark hall, usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says blame the Maas.
We have a classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space book mountains used skillfully: in the heart of the offices, the Internet-library, chess clubs, environmental and technical facilities.
Especially with black bookcases that serve to finish the walls, the shade, the stair railings.
Their view, texture and smell of unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in the guesswork, what is the unknown material.
"We have to work with secondary materials," says Joop Traborst, the head of the project, representing the community of Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a byproduct of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of artificial fiber materials mm thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin textile is one-two of the season, then it can be released.
The library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes was pressed in the thickness of four cm.
Under the heat and pressure the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable materials, fragrances is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
At the top by 105 steps.
Those who overcome by nearly 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquet and wood Ficusami in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, first and foremost about the proper humidity on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, in spite of the many glass, is a model of the project in terms of ecology," says Troborst.
The warmth of the land is used for heating and cooling.
Although the book Gore is the bell jar, even in the days of the Sun is the only briefly.
The broad farms of laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, give and take on a large part of the sunlight.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection of fully automatic roller-blinds.
Stefan Permon, the aforesaid skeptics from it, has already visited a new library.
Lizette Veraig also was already here.
As well as traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogarde, which called Bukenberg "soul Spijkenisse, which not long enough."
The reason: for a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book of its own assembly.
These books were to take the blank spaces on the shelves is not yet fully staffed libraries is at the moment it was of 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves to get to the top.
"There is nothing worse than empty the library," says the architect blame the Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way associated with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the problem, the professional jargon called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And they are very young and uneducated.
It is only the starting point for the development of identity.
Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role."
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany will need to be careful because of its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence while not acting too critical towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.
As a result, the NATO held this proposal.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complicated international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely from the policy, which, so to speak, led by the US, the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have not agreed a unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.
I believe that as long as they are just groping their role, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain.
What specific means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to take in their national position, does not depend on the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other major countries, and so Germany must defend their interests.
Whether these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?
Firstly, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the countries of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, she should be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case it plays a role.
But I would not attach too much importance, it is not completely one-sided.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Whether Germany will harm its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the US is understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was such a dramatic step as in the Libyan issue.
Germany may even will thus a certain respect.
This signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international arena and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe, there are various opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
On the contrary, the US clearly voted for the veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the US and many European countries?
The strength of the American domestic politics such differences existed.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of European positions.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly in such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as always.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not the policy of Netanyahu.
Germany easily combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU with others?
I think that is what makes the situation is difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be few easier, if there is a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so.
So they cannot act within the framework of a broader approach and forced instead to act on its own vision of the situation.
This is the way they are with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel.
This topic has always been delicate.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player is not whether she will take a really the main role?
Or a leading role is still a hard Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far it is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various Antigermanski feelings.
The Germans did not just to cope with it.
In fact, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view of Germany is much more precarious position than the US.
It should take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
So, the impact of the US in European policy constantly weakened, but at the moment the EU does not fill the vacuum, then who is?
The Germans simply have to play a more important role.
Even if you don't like it, unpleasant or fueling enmity to you is life!

"The protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani polo?
It is officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the names of firms, from which it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not sued.
But then, it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"The foreigners it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for the company Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of the rights of the trademarks in the far east.
On my table every week appears on a new case of this kind.
The simulator add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
Lu is derived from the Gucci-Gucci, Prada instead of Prada can be registered-Kny.
The same way legally copied the German enterprises, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens the folder with the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF, Puma artificial name, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese-World chess copied and violation of intellectual property rights, it is known.
In the big cities there is multilevel stores selling almost exclusively of forgery.
However, the case is not Pattla. on behalf of their clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the registration of trademarks the right to use the name, which already is somewhere else.
The Chinese call it a "ban inpay," Mark-passengers.
This word is associated with the "ban Dacuan."
The so-called women who are hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"It is detrimental to the business, it is necessary to fight," says Pattloch.
"trademark blurred, a unique situation is lost, the image is very much suffering."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copy products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and fastest-growing market for luxury items.
However, the Registry to remove the disputed trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch tells the story of cases in which the court rejected claims, as at the end of a long time to overturn the name was "the reality of the market."
If the plaintiff is not lucky, he will have to pay the copycat, even as the damaged its trademark in China, "says Pattloch.
Sometimes possible the rule of law of the jungle.
There is also a famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a court dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, the company shortly before a firm-producer of concrete Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to a Mercedes.
To buy Volvo company Geely initially used a blue-and-white logo, BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The producer of fashion goods from Hong Kong and Singapore simulator Lacoste lost in China, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
The registration of trademarks Ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment of the premises there had been difficulties.
But in the last year was "the return from an emergency situation in a workflow to normal."
However, the number of raw affairs objections decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, the 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the agency.
To fight against this is expensive.
As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the Ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China for the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations around the world, according to the agency.
The same is true of the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011, was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If the simplified, this means that each registration worth an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The appeal it is many times, as the case shows the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of them fake car parts was liquidated.
However, the simulator has for a Chinese rights to the trademark of Freudenberg.
It was their own shortcomings, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, "says Hanno Ventler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks Ctmo rejected the claim Munenev.
The truth is that in both the following instances Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far.
It is necessary to be on the alert
The question is now pending in the Supreme Court.
Ventler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs are hardly accounting, the archive firms had to see even acts a hundred years ago to bring the evidence.
Five years ago, the Freudenberg in vain proposed a side of the "great Sestisnacnuu amount in euros for a settlement.
"It is clear how expensive it to us," says Ventler.
The danger of the far East threaten to spread even in Europe.
And in the case, if the simulators registered there for a unprotected trademarks.
However, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of the Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.
"It is necessary to be vigilant," says Ventler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that somehow should protect register also in China," says Ventler.
Otherwise, it may be much more expensive than a registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about the trademarks, will have to pay a license fee for a name, explains Ventler.
Otherwise, we will from the market in the segment.
World AIDS Day: Yaga, sing, help
In Heidelberg rehearsing the choir Imbong Swaziland, AIDS orphans are.
The history of the relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
The first is stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' frail vessels and male slippers pick cycle on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then slowly increase the voices of the singers bass, alto, tenor and soprano they come, enchant and follow each other.
And gear Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor is not out of their cloth shoes, when they flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg choir Imbong rehearsing a new song.
The rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old, from specialist on human genetics to Porter.
"The" Bani "is an easy thing, every voice choir has to, in addition, the alien language: Sulusscom, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the assessment of the UNAIDS, the United Nations programme on AIDS, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population of HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Asiteni Association voices for Africa was chef in Germany.
70 of them attend school, prepare for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros per month can take the patronage.
It ensures the child money on the school, school uniforms and daily hot lunch in the center.
Imbong Sulusscom language means the narrator or Voswalitel.
In this room do not speak fluently on the Bantu, but can sing.
Nearly ten years the choir learned the songs on this another soft language and occasionally even takes them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
At a distance of 8733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland, is a small village Asiteni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
The infected Forty percent
There are about 2,000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus.
The miniature Asiteni reflected the disease of Swaziland: a high level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection, half the population is almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, the death in the middle of the fourth 10 is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the participants Imbogni saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country there is no chance at all.
For the first time it was private obligations of individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later the choir founded the association "voices for Africa," which since almost professionally takes care of AIDS orphans in Asiteni.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs are syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (gonorrhea).
The frequent viral STIs are human papilloma virus, genital herpes, HIV and hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the main striking the group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer is as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often sexually transmitted diseases are Hlamidianne infection, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low-but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among the youth Hlamidianne infection are significantly more likely than other populations.
According to European, three-quarters of all infections are young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among the youth is also often meets human papilloma virus.
As is the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007.
In 2011, was about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms of the venereal disease?
The infectious diseases may arise in the field of genital ulcers, complaints of urination, the selection, the pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as the bubbles or seal.
However, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide absolute protection.
It is part of sexually transmitted diseases can also apply through contact infection and close physical contact.
So experts recommend a regular inspection, especially when the frequent change of sexual partners.
The early diagnosis can be cured, the majority of STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Donations, patronage and last but not least fees for the choir throughout Germany allow something to collect.
"We all sent in Asiteni about 200,000 euros," says Annete Lenartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of money of Germany disposes of Cova Dlamini, the conscious and active women.
It is also about to orphans were well organized, for example, one of the grandmothers.
GOGs, as called on Sulusscom old women, is a pillar of the village.
Some of them have to up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and take care to children in the form of every day to appear on the lessons.
Those who have no relatives, are in a shelter to Hanisile, a lonely woman, receiving a salary from the association, as well as two Cook, who are preparing every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" a sewing school, built two run and with the American health organization PSI organized a surrender of analysis on HIV for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease that is so evident across the country, prefer deeply silent.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lenartz, "because it is related to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, is known for its love for the excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such a state-sanctioned lifestyle also blame for the fact that the virus is spread rapidly in recent years.
But it is also the stray workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, "says Annete Lenartz," but do not use them.
Another culture-flesh to flesh. "
To support a cultural exchange, the choir Ibogni every two to three years to make the trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent since the days of apartheid.
The bus full of white, singing songs on the black-language is a recognition of not only brings a good mood and joy, but even happened, the tears on the eyes of the border.
The trip also always leads in Asiteni, where singers attend selected children.
Despite the fact that a small village hardly can be found on the map, in the valley of the River Culveni she is more than known.
"Go to the Asiteni, there is light," say the local people.
After the 8733 kilometre-long flight back in Heidelberg, when the stomping singers back in the rehearsal room on the street Bergaimer, one can see that this light is also possible.
The messenger: NASA opens the ice on Mercury
The "Messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
The ice may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closer to the sun, there is also a frozen water, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The "Messenger" found evidence that is constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
His thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Admittedly, the water is a comet or asteroid, confronting Mercury.
No one sees the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, "said Sean Solomon, scientific supervisor of the probe.
The temperature of the Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life in other places of the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes, Phoenix telescopes and small robots, for example, explore the depth of the universe.
From time to time they are on the ground images: a small window in the endless Dali.
The image comes from the camera, developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This piece of Spitzer infrared telescope images is "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the old star in the starry blue points, difficult to identify a pink "newborn stars."
This region Galaxy-Scientists Neromantino call it W 5-opened in the constellation Cassiopeia, Spitzer telescope at a distance of 6,500 light years away.
This iridescent heat of a dying stars photographed the NASA Spitzer telescope.
A donut ring consists of material, which stars threw in the process of dying.
The giant nebula Trifid, remote at 5,400 light years from Earth, of gas and dust are the new stars.
The telescope NASA Spitzer made the photograph of the galactic maternity Hall.
"The starry constellation Pleiades, also called" The Seven Sisters, you can see the night with the naked eye. "
Of course, the telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks observer nebula snail on this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photos of color.
This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
This may be pieces of the moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the greatest and most clear pictures of Hubble telescope: Galaxy Whirlpool
Depending on the color images of the spiral galaxies into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory snapshots shows a remote on several thousand lightyears nebula trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name of the Trifid comes from the Latin word Trifidus (Trehdolny, Trehrazdelnia), as the dark bands dust is divided into three parts of the heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus photographed by a space collision: astronomers at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth kernel of the two merging galaxies rushing towards each other and inevitably face.
This is a star is born Hubble Telescope took a spiral galaxy M 83.
Those who do not like the technical cuts, can call it the nickname "the southern Evocnoe wheel."
The photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of a nebula iris in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, the remote 1,400 light-years away, which consists of particles of dust, size from 10 to 100 times less than the usual dust.
This image was made of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, the remote at 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A spiral galaxy scientists called the UGC 1810.
In the Star Nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of the Milky Way.
The cradle of constantly creates new stars.
This is a starry cloud connected with the Rosette Nebula, also creates a new star at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In the bright galaxy with a small black hole is not yet dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe is mainly a hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Perhaps the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans Lippersheem-even before Galileo a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the rearview optical telescopes became more and deeper space available their view.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, "Hal" telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The Mirror, in here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, is "Large Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio cruiser has a giant internal device is only the mirror with a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Mirror "big South African telescope" in South Africa segment for the sake of reducing the cost of.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters in diameter.
The lack of inexpensive constructive execution: telescope tightly seal the vertical angle is limits his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle."
His features: high Svetosobirautchaa ability.
It is in spite of a relatively small diameter mirror-parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in the cosmos.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), the owner of the computer can help by providing its processing capacity.
The views of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "very large telescope is a fully appropriate to his name.
His four mirrors to cover in the visual pipe even the average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."
His main mirror should spread by as much as 42 meters and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirrored elements.
However, the photos should be expected until 2018.
Until 2007 both Mauna Kea telescope Keck "on the Hawaiian volcano is considered to be the largest in the world.
The two are mirrors the ten meters in diameter.
"Keck telescopes" are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them up in the sky with telescopes "Subaru" and Irttf.
In addition, the Mauna Kea will be a new giant telescope with a mirror 30 meters in diameter.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important types of space delivers the Hubble space telescope.
On April 24, 1990, he delivers the picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, "the Kepler space telescope" is looking for a planet outside the solar system, the first such is life.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 planet candidates have been detected since the start of the mission.
The photos show a recent cooking "Kepler Space Telescope."
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space aboard rocket Ariane 5 not earlier than 2018. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of telescope: the light of the first stars and galaxies are looking for the big bang.
The scientists suggest that at the south pole of Mercury is ice.
However, there is no reliable data about it as a "messenger" moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
The radar measurements for decades pointed out that the mercury is ice.
Thanks to the running in 2004, the probe "Messenger" is the first, which revolves around Mercury-scientists now know it.
Drink butter every day and live up to 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan, many residents are biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year old men seem still relatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan, many residents are biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year old men seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus with a rumbling along the winding road by a dense Forest Hills, turbulent rivers and the simple peasant houses.
All around green and bright, that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
The Talysh live here is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are fluent in Farsi and are Aserbaidanskom and longevity.
The final point is LRIC.
The small town of presumes too ponderous Soviet-era architecture, which is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost did not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too tiring.
The 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has just one lane.
The legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil from the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet reached.
Pilate Fatulava (48) is convinced, however, that there are more interested in Lerie tourists.
"In May, the Baku famous Eurovision song festival and the Festival will be held in next year we have the oldest people in the world," says Fatulava.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Documented biography of roughly eight dozen of Talish of these places, where more than 100 years. Fatulava points on the black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Iral Muslumov, who allegedly was 168 years old.
The birth certificate, however, is not.
And, taking into account the fact that the old man, whose age was 122 years old, the age, confirmed the documents Muslumova is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulava.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 child at the age of 136 years he had allegedly born daughter.
So whether the Shepherd Muslumov added a couple of years to age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of livers in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many older people can also be found in some areas of China, Japan, or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "Sardinia also lives are a lot of very old people."
However, due to the lack of scientific proof of age it is impossible, because there was no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Lerik shockingly often reach biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over the age of 100.
Why is here, in the south, so many livers?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugisade explains this special genes of Talish.
The director of the museum Fatulava, on the contrary, believes that the nutrition.
The Talysh people like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drinking a glass of baked oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or the case in primitive lifestyle that keeps people youth in Engemirane, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives, Mirzoev.
In the 97 years it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirseva, which argues that it has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly pushing back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons and daughters Mirsaevo, which already has its own grandchildren.
There are also nearby leap two babies.
The kitchen offers prepare tea is served in a typical pot-bellied Armud glasses.
Mirsaevo perfectly aligned and strong white teeth, Under a headscarf she hides long dark flaxen spit that her son proudly opens before us.
I always my hair milk, so that they will never break and saved the color.
"And I never used shampoo," says Mirseva.
A monthly pensions enough for life
She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For the rest of my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she tells her husband, who served in the Army.
The most difficult was after the second world war.
But it was better when the "beloved father Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm of."
The propaganda did not often sounds in the speech of the old woman.
However, the cult around the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins of power to his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, the Azerbaijani seniors is not poverty.
The 230 manats (approximately the same as the amount of euros) Mirseva receives monthly as a pension for the local conditions is the amount that you can live well.
And, perhaps, for a long time has grown son Mirsaevo rights: "The elderly in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a big family, love, surrounded by the care and happy.
No reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The word "human rights" is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep rift in the country.
The future of the constitution based on Sharia, met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on Paphos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success is my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was requested to all the people, but in the first place to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-Egyptians.
All of them, still hopelessly fragmented in his opposition, fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, a degree of doctor of American at the University of Southern California, it is not clear that Egyptians and the rest of the world.
There will be deprived of judicial power?
In fact, 234 articles was dragged into the night the 15-hour jump with obstacles Slamistski configured the constitutional assembly of 100 members, and it is partially concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the procedure is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one can fear that the Islamists will use the vague wording and arising in connection with a legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At the very least, it suggests one Novovvedenna article: in all matters relating to the sharia, should be for the Council of University Al-Aar, the Islamist institutions of the country, a great prestige around the Sunni Islam.
This could mean that the clergy, but not to supervise the de facto legislation that would be a consequence of the limitations of the judiciary.
The draft constitution is the subject to interpretation
Another problem: should the jurisdiction of civilians, a military court.
These courts during the period of Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military custody were to 11,000 civilians.
As stated in the project, the state should also protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control the content of cinema and literature.
Open Text this does not mean that other, as censorship.
No article establishes the equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, it remains unclear.
Questionable also seems to be the wording that it is forbidden to "insulting the people."
Will it be enough cartoons on the president or jokes about the legal?
And the question of how much of this project that Morsi offers the signature and that, according to him, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians at the referendum.
"The revolution returned."
A few weeks is the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force.
"The revolution is back, and we win," said Amin Sabbah, took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution "the dustbin of history."
After a short news service Twitter he accused of Morsi to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and depose him," said opposition, Yasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not revenge," quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that he did not want to observe the referendum that would make it null and void.
"The Koran is our constitution."
A well-organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the demonstrations, but of precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile before the Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters who shouted: "The people will require the use of God's law."
They demanded Morsi: "cleanse the country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, the state of civil war.
Followers of Morsi, obviously, did not want to go to these risks.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution expressed loud and clear.
Now it is time to give the people decided at the ballot box, in what direction it should go to the country.
The majority of the project for the Islamists, it is considered a done deal.
"The notion of a" human rights "never mentioned."
Hafiz Abu Syed in fury from the constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (PR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when Mubarak they were in prison or appear before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because of human rights for him is indivisible.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never met in a new constitution, he complains in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of power in the state disappoints lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of to strengthen civil state, the president of the de-facto annulled it," complains Syed.
Without civil society organizations democracy could not function.
Syed feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This may come back.
The demonstrators in Tahrir Square, warns: "You are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."
The Norwegian Rafisk: the bad smell of fish in the world?
The population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country is somehow linked to the local addiction to one extremely stinking fish dishes?
Take a few Peresrevih pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
Please get Otsibautchiy smell the smell of Rafiska is one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque species. it is a very beautiful, but in the air into ineradicable tangy smell.
Rafisk is Trout, sprinkle salt and walked in water up to a year, depending on what it is nice to be achieved.
As dusk and temperatures drop, the crowd of Norwegians are collected at the festival in Agernese dedicated to this, so to say, exciting dish.
"It is wet and washed down with a glass of Aquavit, the local Tinnoy vodka," explains separately Alvarsen, the local fire by profession and "Rakfiskovia the general, who is in charge of the festival."
All around us people eat cut into small cubes fish and dissolving its large portions of alcohol.
"Someone like aquavit than Rafisk," says separately.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try to a couple of pieces.
If you will be able to carry a piece of the nose, everything is not so bad-differs little from serving sushi, you were in a bus for a long time.
The Norwegian Rafisk is the product of an entirely different time, poverty, when even before the emergence of refrigerators, fish in the autumn Samaivali in a closed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in the winter, when fish has been well and thoroughly Sabrodila, it removed, and the perception of the alcohol consumed in the food.
The memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mostly in the United States.
Now the population is rapidly growing more than 13 percent of immigrants who are here jobs, high wages and developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, not so long ago and far more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rafisk is seen as an important symbol, will, though some of the elements of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, is a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you dearly in 9 pounds (14 US dollars).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the World, and most of the inhabitants of the country that seems to be happy.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and right-wing extremists in the last year, shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the attacks are called "what happened on July 22."
The Norwegians are very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
The heart of today's well-being of Norway (growth since the beginning of the Seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, the trays with matured Rafiscom, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic welfare.
We are people-as you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks fluent in English.
We do not love are on display, we are not boastful.
Norway is very carefully with its oil is a big part of the income of oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.

"As long as you can go skiing in the winter and go hiking in the summer, it is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there are Rafisk," she adds with a laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food-Rafiska falling down.
This is a whopper with elk meat is certainly exotic, a delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for more of the same fish with an unforgettable odor.
In my hotel will hold a special dinner, Rafisk, during which visitors vote to determine the best or, perhaps, the most fragrant fish.
A direct TV, which shows the lead in the tie-butterfly, surrounded by plates with Rafiscom.
It is like the Eurovision song contest.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, what you put the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, separately, here is our assessment" ....
Everyone was laughing and cheering.
Someone falls from her chair, perhaps approached to Aquavit.
And maybe, just inhaling the smell of this fish.
The president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto will be tough at the beginning of his career.
While the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will have to face, and on mixed expectations of the population of his country.
The traffic in Mexico is now in a particularly poor condition.
This city overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barrier, cut off several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, it was not to give people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters to get to the building of the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto wearing the presidential sash and will take the reins of the country.
It is no easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the administration of Felipe Calderon, who is now into its powers, but the country is mired in the drug war that has claimed some 60,000 lives for six years.
"My government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to fight violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto earlier this week US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements with the President of the United States Mr. Pena Nieto developed political career as governor of his home state of Mexico.
At home, in the populous and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leaders are divided.
Straightforward people.
In an idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents are credited him to revive tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Pena Nieto, who are very different from those of the roads with potholes and Yam, who were previously on this site.
A placard with his name on a modern building sports center and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman from the state led by Pena Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power party, the PRI was supplanted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The congressman Olvera acknowledges that after his 12-year absence at the Los Pinos presidential palace party has great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
In addition, he refutes accusations of meaningless that the new president of the opposition.
He's a very straightforward and very loyal to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, the man who listen to.
But in other parts of the state, many people have different views of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name Ciudad Neza, is a stark contrast with the cobbled streets Valle de Bravo.
The hidden under the overpass highways, he is in many ways a suburb of the city.
And the problems in the municipality are too harsh character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year for the pacification of drug gangs trading in these areas, the troops were; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
In a wasteland near a landfill only for the last two years was discovered dozens of bodies of murdered women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the Mr. Pena Nieto is significantly higher than a similar indicator in the notorious for violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which became a household name, when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to the opponents of Mr. Pena Nieto, at best, it is possible to say that about him during his tenure as governor, he could not cope with the problem of the killing of women.
In the worst case, however, his administration accused of ignoring the problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like the majority of houses in this ramshackle area, Irineos Bendia barely holding back the tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Mariana moon.
According to the official version of Marian in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that it killed her by.
"When I reached her home, it was likely that her body before it washed," Ms. Bendia recalled.
There were signs that it was beaten, and the body has already Kocenelo.
Mother Marian recounted the story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, where the only one word: justice.
In this, according to them, it was denied this family.
"The state officials treated me as an old gossip girl, discontented Narusitelinizey peace.
They want people to simply accept on faith all, what they say and tongues.
But it is wrong, so it is impossible, especially when around so many violations and defects, "she says.
Wearing a presidential sash on Saturday, President of Pena Nieto together with it will take a hard responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised the crimes related to the violence, and the new president promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same president, was governor," says Olvera, the PRI congressman of Valle de Bravo.
However, this is the most fear the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza.
Bradley Manning not complained of mistreatment, says the charges.
The prosecutors are trying to refute statements Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing attention was paid to stay Manning in a military prison in Vantiko, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that conditions of Manning were brutal.
US Army private accused of kidnapping of thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that private Bradley Manning, accused in the largest leaking classified material in US history, had failed to take advantage of many opportunities to make a complaint on the abuse, which according to him, he had to move in a military prison.
During cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor Major Aden Fein said that the record weekly visits Manning representatives for the first nine months of his detention in prison administration Vantiko, Virginia, does not contain complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination in the consideration of the request of the defence case Manning, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the next day after Manning said that he wanted to commit suicide in custody.
Military specialists on the analysis of intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet site WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the prosecutor feign together with Manning the reports that were filled after visits Vantiko Manning administration officials during his stay in prison, where he was on the conditions of the strict regime prison since July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits to the prison asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that the appeal to a part of the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
The reports do not contain complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, according to feign.
Manning replied that he expressed oral concerns about these problems and that visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but it is not recorded in writing.
"They recorded" no problems "(after the discussion of my complaints), but this does not mean that I did not raise the topic of conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why then not complained of any treatment of him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission considered suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for a few months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that he was acquitted of "preventing injuries" mode and softened conditions.
The representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited mode of detention at the lower level than supervision to prevent suicide was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the sake of security of others.
"I wanted to make sure the administration knows that with me all in order to cancel the regime preventing injuries ... to the level of my life, from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at the naval base in Vantiko, Va., in July 2010.
He said that he had thought about suicide appeared to Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness because of the heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult when you do not know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world's up to the Base Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought that I die in this cage."
In Vantiko, Manning, according to him, spent most of the time in a small cell-at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day alone.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a few items of clothes, mattresses, blankets, slippers and eyeglasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lying in the daytime banned the rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in the eyes of his constantly beat the light outside the camera.
If the guards had not seen his face, when he flips in bed at night, according to him, his arousing and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection over the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Livenvort, Kansas.
In addition, the judge questioned Manning on Friday, the statement that he made during the testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Vantiko, forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning.
Manning said that do not have the opportunity to defend a blanket during the test.
Answering the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that understood from the guard that must throw a blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one ordered him to throw his right.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night it was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning said that told the officer that could use the gum trousers or slippers to injure themselves, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and eyeglasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, to take into account the fact that he had to survive while in detention, and significantly reduce the sentence in the case, if Manning is found guilty by a military court, which should start to review his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said that plans to offer Manning acknowledged the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges challenged as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon argues that Manning was held in Vantiko in accordance with the rules governing the contents of those with the most strict regime.
Among the charges Manning, are aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of the publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of the national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to flee to Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans are inclined to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American torn between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico I went along the corridor for arriving, close to the border zone and was on the spot.
The signs pointed to the two: one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).
A few seconds I stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my life called the Mexicans.
This is just a name, just like my friends in Boston themselves as Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves to be Italians.
Later I stayed on a complex construction "the Americans are of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complicated constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the native speakers, and I can't get rid of American accent.
So I took his American passport and was in the queue for extranjeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president of Pena Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans now, with the same success will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to go to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but there was no concrete proposals.
For Mexico's relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances.
Most Americans never thought about that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the barrel of a gun forced its leaders to refuse to half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see the reminders of those events around.
So it is worth only to any statesman US Obmolvites while word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society, there are complaints that Americans encroaches on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma Preispolnats militancy.
The most complex are relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans are of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about revenge?
Them enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who are in the country for themselves, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history of someone who is the father or grandfather did not have the opportunity to realize themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.
Most of these were Mexicans a certain type of-two, a swarthy, untrained and poor peasant families.
Their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and get a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not the Mexican.
Our national self-determination and it is unclear, but we know what the country believes.
The United States of America.
Moreover, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeat and treat us as second-class people, as inauthentic Mexicans.
We are not speak Spanish well, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to the failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.
We would not now behind the silk curtain, found in the US and the smug life, but lost spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US in childhood, and it reminds me that there are certain friction between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin: Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Mexican Americans is a shame.
She is a US citizen and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not belong to any one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the US, we are Mexicans.
Now, as I learned during his trip, like our relations without having not intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want to the Mexican Americans worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell his fellow Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great it to visit, and could convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing.
There are too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe that the country so beautiful.
Sorry, but to deal with this ourselves, Migos.
And this is true.
If the Mexicans still could not forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still in bitterness for how recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.
The old battle on the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become a fragile foundation for further peace
If it is possible to have long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
There are, as usual, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the suburbs of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in his eternal conflict, the Middle East, came to change.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab spring "spin in the rebellious storm set of realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the vortex, shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed this week, the clashes only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, who came to power in Gaza in 2007, said from the fact that they forced Israel to back down, despite their losses.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, the Hamas increases its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another of the Palestinian-controlled territory the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may come to the conclusion that the time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world have Hamas new powerful and rich friends.
The resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Gulf.
The victorious Hamas supporters claim the creation of around Israel Islamic crescent from Lebanon in the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more Proislamistski insurgents is overthrown the power of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where King authorities threaten allies of Hamas.
The most significant changes to the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, the most populous and important Arab country in Egypt, where the President Mohamed Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, do not pay special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the contrary, are organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In the future diplomatic understatement Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the "hard line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" to justify the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep, at least for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, the United States remained loyal to its unchanged position; many European countries also blamed for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity in Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis died from missiles, launched from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized of a Palestinian state and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party is in preparation for the January 22 elections is merged with even more aggressively-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What is the meaning of pandering to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If their hands to all the power on the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from missiles in the direction of Israel, as their brethren do in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and to suppress any attempt to raise the head.
Perhaps, the supporters of the "hard" lines are victorious; but their calculations can be refuted the Arab spring.
Despite the fact that the Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority to domestic problems.
Israel's defense budget of more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark a beginning of change.
In Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
As the democratic change in the Arab countries, the denial of the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, sooner or later, like bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has to undermine the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operation, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, has to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need in the external impulse
The only solution is to work tirelessly for sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of the two countries and territories in exchange for security concessions to Israel.
There is hope, not too big in the short term, the hope that the ceasefire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is a long time to make a decision to cut off weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, with regard to the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to the reconciliation of Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would make more than for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote at the UN, the result of which may be a recognition of a Palestinian statehood.
Its role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem.
It is tragically shortsighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law came into force of the unified packaging for cigarettes.
The warnings on the harmful effects of smoking and images are affected by diseases parts of the body contrasting on depressed green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice the Australian law type a pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color of different brands of the same olive flowers with nasty-a bleak snapshot of affected parts of the body and the images of children, their parents' health of smoking.
In addition to the various pictures and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the wads, introduced in a compulsory manner with this Saturday-name brands that printed the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world conditions for the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status.
The basis of such a decision based on the results of the research showed that people, not starting up to 26 years in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.
"It is obvious that even at a young age children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains the health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing research showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so that these changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of such measures are already considering and other countries.
The representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will be supplied much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws to promote the growth of the business.
Sandra Hu from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette and silicone cases to hide the unpleasant pictures on the package, rapidly increased (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra Hu, Zico is already has about six thousand products to the wholesale trade and expects the new party.
This is a good business for us.
The potential is a hindrance for the effectiveness of such measures, according to experts, the popularity of social networking is part of the population, which are these measures.
After the adoption of a series of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting cigarette sellers to the Internet, the advertising of tobacco products moved.
The Australian government has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise in the network, but it cannot limit in the foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco and you have only a small loophole, the idea is to promote their goods on the Internet you will find very attractive," says Beck Freeman, the question of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman says the growing number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of the supposedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this was the work of ordinary citizens who are so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare forces and time and made a video, or advertising campaign is behind this?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules that the advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: These states are claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relationship with Australia is very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first introduced compulsory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is a rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia, he did not obey innovations.
These pictures I do not graze.
I just do not pay attention.
"Just Vihvativaes a cigarette and hides pack in your pocket," explains Viktor El Haig, who cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor mouth on the blister.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me to is my little daughter.
James Yiu, head of the Tobacco store of king of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package will complicate the task of goods on shelves
"I have used the unloading of a new party had gone an hour, and now four hours," he says.
"The government had to take and it was not forbidden cigarettes, then we would say what to do, okay, it's over, closes the shop," he says, hands.
Miss in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of the plane appeared to have mechanical failures and replaced by another plane, the US and wait.
Thus, I had enough time thinking about the nature of the boredom.
I will not deceive you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help books, magazines, or the iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists on child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children here is not so bad.
This causes the brain is distracted by interesting topics that may contribute to creativity.
As in the modern world, we are constantly before any screen, the benefits of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we need to seek to boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time is not.
We will come back to this.
Before I, like many, believes that the boredom of an invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
It is not so, says Peter Tuia, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, the author of the book "a fascinating history of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"actually boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating from the first century.
This remains an open question of how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, "says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
The materials research on the topic and asked the target group of 100 people, a professor of Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but may not engage in what would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between the boredom and apathy, he says, is that the bored man does not do something that would like to do.
The apathy to do nothing.
The main worry about the boredom, he says, is "a violation of attention and associated with the deterioration of sentiment and feeling that the time is slowly."
The description of the boredom may seem very similar to the Depression.
However, the Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people saw the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people who worry depression, see the problem.
Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact it is just difficult for us to focus on something.
In his study "vacant mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor of Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, whose members listened to recordings of voices, read a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the other programs included in the next room, heard the sounds at low volume, so that they hardly could be dismantled, and the third group listened to the recording votes without a sound track.
Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that it was boring, most of it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task interruption attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. fence, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelphs, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we are doing something interesting, "for example, peering into the flow of the pipeline in the search for marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
Second, he says that when people are swaying on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually such actions are simply not relax physically.
"The study found that children who do not prohibit fidget and swirl, learn better and remember more information than children, which require sit," says Professor of the fence.
In some moments we all feel bored: the delay flight (as in my case), listening to the film monotonous speech, watching uninteresting.
However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s for measuring such individual researchers have developed a special "a propensity to boredom."
Questions are used to determine the estimates of such a scale and approval, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and monotonously" or "I'm too much, so all that he did not have enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have determined that the boys bored more girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly when there are a variety of external stimuli.
However, the teenagers are often bored at all.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, an experiment, during which he contacted by pager almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven or eight times a day.
He got the following results: 32% of the teenagers declared that they get bored at the school and during the homework, and 23% announced that they get bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they get bored.
Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would be the data about the boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescence is the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents do not allow fully to decide what they do.
Go back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations, studies have shown that it can encourage people to absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, "says Professor Wodanovic, dedicated to study the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that it is necessary to do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
However, the brain is not always knows what to do better.
If you will get bored and you this energy to play the guitar or culinary experience, you make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will take place.
So, if you miss your child and give him the iPad, he will not get bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom alone or otherwise to manage their time and employment, "says Professor fence.
"Skills such self-regulatory uses in various situations," he says.
Your child learns not only occupy themselves something, he also learns self-control.
I do not think that the tedium to somehow praised.
However, it is not worth something bad, too.
Rather, it is necessary to learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agree with it.
"We see this, so we need more bored, that the boredom is extremely unpleasant, was an insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
Indeed, the people are trying to disconnect the permanent worries and just relax.
"In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulate the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we lost and did not know what to do."
It is unclear how will apply a new law legalizing marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, the Nineteen players football team and public college students in the south-east of the state of Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, is that it will be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September he was with friends in Lamar and drove in a car in the Prairies near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by the police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came subpoenas for possession of drugs and possession of a drug use is a minor offence for each of them due to a fine of 100 dollars and the date of the trial.
"We are treated as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.
But the criminals?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for a few weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small prosecutions depends not so much from the law, how many from the place.
The accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already are in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped the accusations of the people in the age of 21 and older for the storage of small doses that will be considered legitimate, as just a couple of weeks, the law will come into force.
However, the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing business related to marijuana, and still attract the responsibility for the storage of the drug.
At the same time in some cities from suburban Denver to the mountain areas of the West vote for their places in order to prevent the emergence of new licensed state stores to sell marijuana.
"It is growing so rapidly that I don't even know what to expect further," says Daniel J. Oates, the head of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
The representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington also puzzled by the scratches to the head.
They have established the rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it needs to be done before on December 1, 2013.
They say that the Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in settling the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment.
In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they can serve as a good example, "explains Brian I. Smith, a spokesman of the council for the regulation of alcohol production and sales in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, acknowledges that Mr. Smith, put forward some proposals and we hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent that we could find," he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, will come into force on December 6 and the whole year plunge us into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right to possession of marijuana is legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the decree of the state of "adequate access" to its licensed marijuana with a ban on trade at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"Trade will be especially difficult to publish licensed Enterprise marijuana in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," says Ben Livingston, the representative of the newly formed group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent his e-mail that the prosecutor's office of the city will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police will stop people caught in these violations "from this moment."
The head of the police, Oates said that the police will supervise in the city of rules governing the activities of individuals, grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
Weld County prosecutor Ken Buck, in the north of Colorado, is more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he stated that the public prosecutor's office will continue to responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of its treatment.
At the moment of 119 persons charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions, prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the time of their committing," Mr. Baku said in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police Grand Junction, the biggest city in the district, no longer appeals to the responsibility of the adult for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw accusations on already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law, until he does not change our direct responsibilities," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the population of the state of Colorado, who participated in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
A controversial reaction of residents in different places of the ambiguity in the relations of the local authorities to experiment with marijuana.
"There is a cultural barrier district prosecutors in this regard," says Sean MacAlister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They harassed people for this for so long that now cannot truly come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington-the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are the same as alcohol-destined to become experimental field across the country to verify the idea of legalizing drugs.
Advocates of legalization and officials of the state plan to expand the territory to legalize trade, but at the same time they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who continued to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will give on this issue.
Despite several received a wide response arrests of traders and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave good on trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau for the Fight against drugs are unlikely to be broke into houses to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are hardly going to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of the state, recreational marijuana shops that are permitted under the new law, believes Kevin A. Sabet, the former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores in the sale of marijuana, who would not be able to open sooner than a year later.
Last week, the Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has a six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which are likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in a position that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendments.
And now we have, there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and voted for that.
There is still a lot of unresolved issues.
Barker Wayett: I survived from Oxford for what I conservatives.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As I can remember, I always dreamed of enrolled at the University of Oxford.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world institution, the modern counterpart of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization-thinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the department of history at Worcester College at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, resulting in the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not pass and burst into tears.
The friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out, because I didn't like the fact that my fellow classmates sex in the next room.
The writer, E.E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from the greasy cups.
Indeed, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated.
It's not because of my quite unusual name or that I studied in a private school.
I was persecuted for only one reason, the cradle of the Enlightenment it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wayett, was known as an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was the Conservatives.
You ask, why should remember about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, the center-right views, is the same harassment.
This institutionalized and growing hatred of the conservatives students at Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one which is handicapped, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The Conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that they "are often subjected to personal attacks and actively isolate feels unwanted guests because of their political views."
They want to enter the college of additional representative in the committee on equal rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on the BBC 2 documentaries about politics in the student environment "Wonderland: a young, smart and the right," in which conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University who travels in a Rolls-Royces, a silver suit and silver knobby cane.
Conservatives complain that students at other universities of making them "scapegoats for raising the cost of study."
Luke black, 20 years, the vice-president of the Association of conservatives at Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper said that "in the university environment increases distortions in the side of the left.
The people who we don't even know in advance that we brazen and gratuitously disruptive children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the historical faculty of Corpus Christi College, which was filed a petition to strengthen protection of such an atmosphere, calls "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to media center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"It is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussions and just for a normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I was there in September 1986, 18 Timid and shy girl.
Oxford -- from the hatred of the Conservative Party.
The year before the university by the former student Margaret Thatcher its honorary degree because of the higher education budget cuts.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that what awaited me ahead.
I still do not know that teachers not only looked through the fingers at Pom conservatives, but students and gladly took part in it.
The political questions are the miners' strike, the privatization of the government and the opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa-penetrate Obitie panelled walls audiences.
On my first workshop I needed to translate the French of the eighteenth century English, and I was not ready for that followed it.
"Miss Wayett," said the professor, the late Harry Pitt, please, translate the first paragraph. "
The text was me hard, I stumble.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like the cake.
"Tatceristi not teach the French or they just drain is not enough?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
In my eyes were full of tears.
"I advise you to take some initial lessons of the French in his spare time, if you are, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," Probrusal Pitt.
I returned to my room totally miserable.
In the evening in college I was sitting for dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, the second-year student of English who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
"Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
Anyone suspected of sympathy for the Conservatives, will be tortured.
To me it is not easy, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they labor. "
Later, in the local pub, I too cowardly to it.
I insisted that do not all that, "says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
The students of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economy, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of fascist swines.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was flawed, dirty.
"The Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They are smashing each other, the truth?"
I felt like it should be felt homosexuals before the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
If I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
If I was forced to become a Labour and hide their true beliefs?
The upcoming me three years to become seems hell, full of hardship and loneliness.
Only a lecturer in my college, did not hide his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to the Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speech.
In college, he practically does not appear.
He despised his remoteness, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-Deterministskom view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy," he told me.
I went to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and friends in the capital.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explain the cause.
He did not believe me.
During his studies in 1940 there were any political views.
"But it's the best universities in the world," he said Alobno.
"There is not capable, not only in the town of slumbering spires ...
Even my friends, the Communists always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes grow dull.
"Do not take any hasty decisions.
I am sure that it is just a joke.
You broke my heart, if you University. "
I was exhausted by constant visits to London and my emotional protection of weakening.
A friend of mine, also conservative, could not withstand the pressure and refused to their beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "the enemy of the people, I decided to do so."
In the soul burning shame, I admitted that "I clean the brains parents," and called them the "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns for weekly publications, owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I was not out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I did not returned.
You can call me Plasoy and a rag.
But in the eighteen years no one should not become an object of such anger and intimidation in the institution.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released Fourteen heads of government of the Tories, but still behind the undeserved reputation of the university, where the value of equality and thinking.
"Valentino prefers elegance of glory."
The exhibition "Valentino: The sewing," which opened this week in London, the ABC talks with Nye Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer

Valentino-with the host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.

He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House was turned into a glamorous catwalk Sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: visitors takes the place of models and to strut the catwalk, contemplating the "spectators" of the dream that sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress, which chose Jacqueline Kennedy for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, suits, who used the Monica Vitti in "night", or wool and leather coat, which belonged to Empress Farah Deeb.
In the audience of models Blestat names such as Sybil Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Rosario Mette-Marit of Norway, Sofia of Bulgaria or the Habsburgs.

Many of these clients say that the first Valentino as the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember it well.
It was the pants, shirts, vests and jackets from the autumn-winter collection, 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he made me," says Nye Abascal, one of the musical designer.
"I prefer to rest for its femininity, for his great love for women, because it underlines our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fera.

The proportions are ideal.
The princess and Patricia della Ovampaola fashion trendsetter, "Renberg also cannot forget the first time dressed in Valentino.

"Valentino indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.

The hardest profession in the world: the miners with cava-Idena
For four euro Indonesian miners are risking their lives and health, Vtaskiva 70 kilograms of sulphur at the top of the volcano on steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their job is hell, while others are literally in hell.
Among them are Zaporizhzha Widjaja, one of 400 miners who earn a living prey of sulphur in the volcano Kawa-Idena, located on the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, the Zaporizhzha descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals contact with air.
Tolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, place a basket on his shoulders and carries them up the precipitous rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, just 250 meters, but exhausted loading it takes more than 40 minutes to climb the snail's pace, with difficulty restraining balance and careful not to stumble and fumble the road has not fallen off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost him his life, as happened with a tourist from France, which failed a few years ago with rocks Kawa-Idena.
The miners with kava-Idena earn 5 euro for each kilogram of sulphur that drill
Being at the top, they are paving a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were apes from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, walked three kilometers to weights that mining company is a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about the PT Kandy Grimbi, the company that operates this volcano since 1960, and it is best not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro) petrochemical production, the minerals is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, Cai, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching.
"As the norm is carrying 70 kilograms, we earn around 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each Hoku," explains US Zaporizhzha, which usually operates three daily carrying.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels heartbroken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be nothing for such a superhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"Podenna fee miners is very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the Zaporizhzha was not so heavy, but returned with his family in Baneuvangi, a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same as massive as Gray: "I married the girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought it on Java to embrace Islam."
The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing and he has eyes because of the toxic gases
In his 27 years Zaporizhzha spent three years, risking a kava-Idena sulphur, which has already started to affect him despite the availability of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing and he has eyes because of toxic gas, which emits a volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"to work for another two years, because I want to open the shop or the French or Spanish," he promises more than acceptable English.
This pleasant and intelligent young man punished life, could be a tourist guide, the waiter, or the receptionist at the hotel, but instead he performs mule.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other porters, he rises every day in the two hours of the night, because Gray does not cease to flow out at night, when its characteristic yellow into blue and brilliant among the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Zaporizhzha down in the crater, covering the way a small flashlight, attached to his helmet, which he bought for their money.
Around 400 porters to drag basket with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company not mechanized extraction sulphur savings and does not provide any equipment for porters, who are working on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not even part of a fee of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros), which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules.
"This work for cattle, not for the people," says Barusin, stocky porters 42 years, who spent on kava-Idena three decades, since he left college.
It is capable of up to 110 pounds, he insists he will work "as much as we can," because he needed money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Do not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although Gray is burning throats and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changed and catches of miners in the dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy, that no one complains about their heavy disease ... more serious, it is clear that their habitual arthrosis, pain in his knees, breathing problems and ulcers on the shoulders that deformed under the weight of Corzine.
Hovering basket on his back, now only Uninik can raise the 50 kilogram in its 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades a 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano that three truck carrying at a warehouse in Tamansary, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along the narrow path among.
"do not retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says Uninik, opening his mouth wide, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, 30 years, also operates a sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what are the human mule with kava-Idena.
Singapore is looking for children to save economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore is growing."
I am a husband patriot, you are my wife Patriota, accomplishing our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising chewing bread, however, despite -- or perhaps because it is a video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses the local proverb like "Let's put bao (buns) in the stove," to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH, the hope that with the help of advertising will be able to draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to the people "of its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst of their kind in the world, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.
We knew that the government is trying to do so much, for example, launching perfume with pheromones or organized parties fast dating (blitz-visits).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely a rap?
1.2 child
Those who do not accept this so lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends 1,300 US dollars a year on policy for the enthusiasm of the citizens of the birth of more children.
The state package for couples and parents offers up to 15,000 dollars a child, extend maternity and provide tax breaks for the holidays.
But it has a low efficiency.
Singapore is the rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, is also a certain conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birthrate in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was below the 2-what is known as a percentage of replacement in 1976.
So why the Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of policy for couples and families of the national office of population, says that the reason "improved education" and "a broader range of career opportunities."
"It is allowed to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of the family," she explains.
These changes to the social norms that contribute to the growth of the number of bachelor and long delays of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, the immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where is barely concealed xenophobia in relation to many of the new immigrants, especially Chinese, have criticized for keeping wages low and unwillingness to integrate.
The growth of the immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year was the worst result of the election since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of the quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While falling fertility has a certain impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, for example, Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to are not so much a small housing.
For example, it is the beginning of the real estate sector.
A guide to urban development shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments 46 square meters are sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to the bachelor lifestyle and deprived of incentive to developers who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, the general director of construction firm El developers, says that "boxes of shoes sold much faster than the more spacious copies."
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than the larger apartments.
As a result, our cash inflow increase.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers who used to diagnose obstacles if they want to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstretched
Singapore is the city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national rate, after a conversation with the Singaporeans, who work in the financial district of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, expensive, as well as housing, education, and because of this many people this delay," says a young managers.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mention of his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that they have a child.
So, no matter how the government has encouraged its citizens to the birth of children, in terms of, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
The personal in the offline-personal online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, we are talking about the property of the private or "sphere of personal life that have the right to protect from any interference."
That is a personal for minors under 16 years?
As he applies this definition in their daily lives and in social networks?
Whether he understands the danger, which is under discussion in Internet situations, which certainly would not have shared outside the Internet?
Elperiódico interviewed five children from ten to 15 years, the frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they are associated with the term "something very hospitable," in a personal jet, "and" password and username "when applied to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I would not be downloaded in the post," says ten-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain the meaning of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has accounts for two years already.
"It is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
The FB I load the beautiful pictures or pictures of the Games.
I also play with their friends.
"I would not shared photograph, which is not my or someone who is stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that bad publishing obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or obscene or violent comments.
Jorge insists that knows 35 friends who have him in the FB, and nine of its Folloverov Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
The mother of the course, it has a password to one of the accounts.
I started to Twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I meet, I only their load," he adds.
"The social network is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends is rapid," he says.
Without a second thought, is that would never have accepted a request from unknown persons.
Would not be with someone who would recommend the stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
This boy have opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ask, and in the latest acknowledges that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It is not scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, nobody Vtirals in confidence and not asked him to his home address or phone number.
"If I will pressure or demand, just remove them from their account," he says.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of my friend blackmail in the social network.
He threatened and extorted money.
"He did not know who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, not remove the account.
"Only the confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to account settings securely.
In contrast to Jorge, the boy uploaded the photos Konfusni or acquaintances in uncomfortable situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if the person I don't like or if I want to do it.
"Although I know that it is cyberbullying," he confirms.
The key issues
Mareels Porras, who teaches English and an expert on education and training, believes that to children and teenagers, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she says.
Porras indicates that the academician Marc Prensky, a master of pedagogy of Yale University and the author of Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
They are digital natives, children and young people who were born in the era of technologies.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
Explains that this topic is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria that may or may not distribute, publish or speak, at the age of maturity, when there are not enough for this."
"They were also to selective, while the most important for them to be popular, with thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, the questions that make them think.
"to talk to them to do this, it is useless," she added.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things that he would not be the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if you like the one that would have published a photo published you about his friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign photos with the parties, do you ask permission for other people to celebrate them?
And another, all I need to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"Beyond the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be in the social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo airport, a university teacher, a professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for a heads of families in good faith to read the policy of social networks.
Each of the points, they have good reasons for talks with children about the preconditions for opening an account in the Internet.
"For example, the age and the fact that allowed to distribute or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, the key question to remind children lesson "not to talk to strangers."
The Unasur summit ends without the de Lima Declaration
The 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the de Lima Declaration, previously and theoretically signed seven binding participants.
EFE repeatedly trying to get access to the document, signed at the sixth regular meeting of the heads of state and government Unasur, but sources from the chancellery and the administration of the President indicated on the main page that it will be after the closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the Web site of the Peruvian government.
Questions about the text, they indicated that the content was described by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists access to information about the summit was all the time is limited.
During the day only for the press, the video was broadcast in the hall of the Presidential assembly without sound with the message "closed meeting, the sound is forbidden."
A little information circulating among reporters, was handed over to the press secretaries of some governments Unasur, present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The document, common during the day, it was the list of participating presidents, that caused the displeasure of the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the president of Peru sent an email to the media with "final declaration" of the summit, but it is a question of Humala's statement, not on the official document, by the end of the summit.
Last October, Peru took the third summit of South American and Arab countries (APS), and at that time, despite the fact that this is insistently demanded the press, also was not the so-called Lima Declaration, which previously announced.
On the official website of electronic, you can check to make sure that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings of the Peruvian authorities tried to provide the transmission system for all journalists, but the most limited information.
The summit also ended a joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict, the Hague court settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Pinera, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that will abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which starts on Monday at the Hague hearing statements on both sides, in the framework of the accusations that Lima put forward against Santiago.
"We are going to enforce the decision, which will that we are currently present in the International Court of Justice," said Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals," Pinera added, and welcomed his hands of Humala in the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they disobey the International Court of Justice, happened shortly after Colombia protested this week Bogotsky pact, according to which she acknowledged the verdict of the International Court of Justice after the decision of sea borders with Nicaragua, which it considered flawed.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership of the Unasur was suspended from 2011 after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and the closing of the summit, a little later at noon on Liscomu time.
The head of state to read the final document, which reported that were taken 16 agreements and were approved by the direction of the 31 project among South American countries, the amount of investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the accepted agreements he mentioned that the UNASUR countries to take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding agreement about the place of residence."
He said that the actions are taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity of citizens and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the aggregate and effectively the risks of natural disasters."
Because Europe is in crisis, "the economic association (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist basis and should serve to expand our production bases and foresee a better future for our cities," Humala added.
"We decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the relations of South America, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our country and forming a new economic scheme," the Peruvian president said in the message read.
Among these projects he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and are limited by axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at greater ties with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-join the Union of South American Nations, from which it is currently excluded.
The necessity to Latin America remained a region of prosperity and peace, would be United, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another topic, stressing at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before to participate in a regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for negotiations in a form of maritime disputes as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice, the Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday), to meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will revise all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussions with Nicaragua," he said.
"President Ortega, I hope, I told him that we are going to handle this as much as possible the civilized and respectful manner," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have provided the presence at the inauguration of the new president of this country, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Also within the framework of the defense ministers of the pre-summit met for the approval of the plan of action for 2013, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname, Uruguay and Paraguay form the Unasur, although the participation of the latest countries suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe. "
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "but now they are one country."
He defended, in this context, the project to establish the South American citizenship, who approve of the Unasur countries.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers on any South American country, as this is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but until now there are reactionary sectors that want to get back to us in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has proved, in addition, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligations, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"Inexplicably, is that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is funded by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa, assured that does not regret this decision, because he is not betraying their principles and abide by its "profound values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be the process."
In addition, the Swedish justice, he criticized for requirements to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it by videoconference that could be made of the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa, confirmed that there is a risk of a deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not talked to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problems, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
Indeed there are, however, is a danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health of the cell in a small space without opportunities to exercise outdoors.
"It affects the health of the person," he added.
Correa, pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity that will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that the negotiations were in London for a solution to the problem of the cell of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, it is in this case, we do not use, but there were constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is a number of processes in various European instances," he mentioned.
And opined that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and perfectly as it did in other cases, the question of Senor Assange the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogated him on Skype tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to show itself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression. "
"The main enemies of freedom of the press is not the villains-politicians, and bad journalists, supporting profits, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that neither these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries-hegemon does not prevail in Ecuador," and added that was re-elected, "deepen the revolution to continue to develop in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality," because in fact "it has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considered, moreover, is "totally reasonable" to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos are now negotiating with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice the Hague, which turned out to be in favor of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, the solution is not enforced.
It is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together.
It is necessary to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope for a good end to the dispute on the maritime borders that are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "the right thing to do for Latin America to apply to the international court, if the two countries undertake to adopt a decision, no matter how hard it was."
The ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes difficult."
Correa, assured that if loses the election in February 2013, away from public life.
Personally I was never interested in power, but in unfair situations, such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power.
"My political movement that I was guaranteed that the probable victory, so we have to admit this responsibility," he said.
In the case of a victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we go out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment, which had been scheduled, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the intensification of the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state participated in Lima today in the 6th Summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
The mortality rate from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"It stunned me," he recalls the difficult moment, despite all the cycle of a doctor.
The young man concealed it from his family.
To cope with the disease, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. and his efforts to materialize, he has already celebrated the 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, breaking a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 22 years. In the early 1990s in it would be hard to believe is too little, then there are options for treatment, too little is known about the disease, were too biased to the sick.
However, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had cuts."
In other words, those times have AIDS was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and did not worsening the quality of life.
Nevertheless, I don't know about his illness, many people still come, when the virus is already damaged, "drained" of their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious science publication.
Infectious and an expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, the patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD 4, and up to 50 years, when the reported 500 CD 4.
Simply put, this means that those who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that Mexicans today the average life expectancy is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients died in the national database.
In Jalisco 255 people have died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, it is claimed that there is a widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
"Why there are still a lethal outcome?
"Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I imagine it, so is the case in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that the patients come very late, because they don't know their HIV status, i.e., the stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come when already have some opportunistic infections; that needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on overall mortality is able to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that this will be asked."
In his proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council for the prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabricio, who turned to check in a private laboratory Pobugdennia only by the fact that it has made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and do not want to know.
"still die, the better I shit three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do my exercises, accept drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of class, I am an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of yourself and the other man," listed Fabricio, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to its statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is experiencing fear.
Let them get if was the risk of contamination, even as soon as possible to learn whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have the diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, was responsible.
This is his message summarizes the theme of the struggle against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms are behind the counter
A large gap between programs in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, which has a problem associated with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, devoted to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, used to give us one or two, now we give packages hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still does not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why are you?" is a popular issue with Eidstwom and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees at pharmacies and health care workers, who do not want to hear the teenagers, assured propagandists.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution of condoms were not only for the largesse to hundreds of them was in machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This is not promote promiscuity.
We are not talking about the payment of beer and the motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether it is possible the distribution of condoms under his leadership.
"It is not sexuality, the best way to make condoms available for those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
The key data in Jalisco
Registered 13,435 total 1,317 HIV/AIDS cases (12,158).
The state takes the 4th place in the national rating on new and total cases of HIV/AIDS and the 13th.
92 percent of infections are sexually, 6% of the blood and 2% to perinatal route.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, like the one registered case there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about this.
Given the ratification of the court of appeal of the United States, the decision that the debt restructuring group Vitro, reached by the production in Mexico, the screenplay sets a precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problem.
It seems that the procedures for the survival of the firms that allowed Mexican laws are not valid in the country bands and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the judgment on June 15, Judge Harlin Hale in bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Texas, leaves threatened the Mexican firm in the face of the possibility of arrest on their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the door for a leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing evidence of three inconsistencies.
The accession, while the judge in the case notes that creditors should be governed by the US bankruptcy code, the Fifth District Court of Appeals in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings for the production of in Mexico.
The first item implies the cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose was the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, as the referee of the American Institute of the law.
Secondly, the verdict sets, subsidiary of voting recognized in a critical mass of competitive production of debt, which had before the parent company branches vitro would not have been achieved, the most necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize the Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case when is this scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Megfirmenne debts guaranteed by the federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting the voice branches, one way or the other creditors vitro that fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds "vultures" like Aurelios capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have a majority.
The voting would be 45 percent against 37.
These data, the court of appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses the Vitro in a difficult situation with which she has faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis that hit the United States, causing a shock to the country.
So far, the family firm Gonzalez garden would appeal to the Court of Appeal to vote itself came to the plenum, i.e., five judges, due to the fact that only three voted.
In the case will be heard about an identity that will require the revision of the process by the court of appeal, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worse, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of the amicus curiae "(friend of the court)," which is a process that should vitro in the framework of the law on competitive production, signaling that it frees itself from the observance of the agreements, signed by both countries to connect it with Article 15 of the US bankruptcy law.
Moreover, it is noted that the country to the principles of the United Nations Commission on international trade, i.e. the rules set for the cases of the Interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two boards: they are in vitro and hit the country.
The total balance

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The avid basketball traveler Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years is connected to this sport and, thanks to him, traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And before a brain haemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years as a player in the small categories, the player of basketball league, the commissioner and the head of BSN with Cowboys Bamon and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I did a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, like when I was the president of BSN, the director-general of the national team and the president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit to his home in Bamon Primera Hora, where he lives with his faithful wife Isabel, for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes did not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia gathered for a long way to go, the evidence of this.
Bamon in the heart of the
The emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when 15 years of his speech in the role of the co-agent or an agent of the contract.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed the most, because the Cowboys had the opportunity to be part of eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
It was for many years, including five Serie A, the last from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year the debut Jerome Minsky in BSN.
Since then, and continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "Reyes said.
I remember that Jin Bartova, who was sent here and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, the rise of the 6'7."
"Do you want?"
This was the beginning of Minsky, one of the best players, who have been in Puerto Rico.
Bartova then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsky brought the championship Bamon, Gauss would help win another.
The championship Cowboys with Gauss I enjoy, but it is already at a distance, because to 1988, the head of the federation.
By the time I prefer to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements of Minsky in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judges who made the final game to beat us, "Reyes said.
The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as a dream team that won at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was that the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the US team, which was quite similar to that won a bronze at the world championships.
The team not only again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Pikulina" (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) 'Tonito' colon and James Carter, the brother of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not participate in the 1990s because of a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team in the Olympic qualifying tournament of 1995, Argentina.
With role players like 'Kanito' Nevesa, Pablo Alisa and the young Rolando Hurritnera replace the players, temporarily suspended for the riots in Mar del Plata Pan American championship, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level, as it did Pikulin.
And it is without taking into account of his career in different leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandit Torres.
The young, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think its main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s in BSN before 17 teams in the season.
What do you have?
There were things that I wanted to realize, for example, the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, to boys of Ponce played only in the field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now they travel and play too much, and it is superfluous.
At least, I can see the fruits of a compulsory certification and course for the board of governors, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally walk on basketball matches.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman died
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Arte (Texas), became famous thanks to its main role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J. R.", the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of predator-oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" has become a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of "Dallas," died on Friday evening because of complications caused by cancer, according to the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the studio production of "Dallas."
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the role that he liked the most," his family said.
The family of Larry and the closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair in honor of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played a role in the sequel, and his wife in the original series was near the Agmenom when he died in hospital of Dallas, said a spokesman Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was a creative, generous, funny, gentle and talented, and I will really miss him.
"He was the original personality and lived a full life," Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted that he drank for many years.
In 1995, he had found a malignant tumor in the liver and he underwent a transplant.
Long before the "Dallas," Hagman has gained fame on television thanks to the role of a decent type in light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, the astronaut, whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl-Jinnah, played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under one roof.
It was also the main character of the two comedies that rarely appeared in the air, "the good life" (1971-72), NBC and ABC, "here we go again" (1973).
His work in the film included the role, well accepted by critics, "the group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation admirably disgusting J.R. led Hagman on top of the glory.
The CBS drama about clan Ewings and other characters in his entourage was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?" designed to create the hype around episodes, full of emotion, in which a character Hagman do not kill, spawned international discussion and millions of dollars are at risk in betting offices.
It also helped to attract show record audience at the time.
When I was answered in the episode from November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned "Dallas" in the second by number of views entertainment program in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983, to attract 50 million viewers.
It was Svoceniza J.R., Christine (played by Mary Crosby), which shot him.
J.R. prevented and then threatened her that accused her of prostitution, if it is not out of the city, but it's also had other reasons for the attack.
Hagman played Ewing as insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: dishonest entrepreneurs and her husband, who wanted to his wife alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), placed on the treatment.
"I know that should be on a tomb J. R.," Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said: "Here Lieth honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal that he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
He is irreplaceable and unforgettable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten new episodes of "Dallas" were a few months ago with great success on TNT.
Already completed recording five episodes of the second of the season and the sixth was in the production, told the channel.
Warner or TNT has not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after the departure of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when has given birth to it in 1931 during his marriage to a lawyer Ben Agmenom.
He to try his luck on the theatrical scenes in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Force England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist may Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I do not include anything that it would be able to hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplant he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital, in order to help patients fear.
"I give them advice, give them courage, meet with them when they go to the operation, and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, such as "Do not be afraid to be a little uncomfortable in a short period of time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
The course, which examines "the end of the world."
Every week, students are apocalyptic phenomena, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Sharm decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of a long countdown "the Mayan calendar on December 21, for which many people seized as evidence that is the end of the world.
But Sharm had no idea that he expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "Dolgoarmagedonom," and the growing conflict, where involved Israel, a place where the Christian theorists of the end of the times, believe that the start of the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that it will be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharma said this week students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we have only 30 days, it was really good period.
And remember that the worst is good for those who have an apocalyptic mind.
And he is not the sole professor, which offers courses on the theme "doomsday" in theory this semester, the latest in history.
Templiscom University associate professor Barry Wacker-reads the course, "the media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students are apocalyptic themes, such as a nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are over time," he said, and the way in which offer the hypothetical scenarios that certain actions.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, can an outbreak of war.
This month, the students analyzed the movies on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they correlate with examples of real life.
"I tried to tell students that perhaps likely, plausible and it is impossible," said Wacker -.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is simply called "the end of the world."
"We do not add '2012 ' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction," the students must learn to prepare projects and to take final exams.
The Penn State final exam will be accepted on the eve of the apocalypse that leaves no choice but to work "to students that night, in which presumably will be the end of the world," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The place of torment for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with high average scores, which signed 35 students.
We have received e-mails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked whether there are still places.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to soothe yourself," said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology of Hadonfilda, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing affairs, said that looked all the apocalyptic movies.
"I never heard about the course, which would be taught," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed-not to mention the professor is not said that believes in the doomsday date on December 21.
"Our first project touched the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Seglen, a 21-year-old student last year in Templiscom University of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which counts for several centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase of these speculations.
"In other places people do not think about it," he said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knows about the course of "the end of the light there."
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that for a long time about many days, the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that on December 21, the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world over.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some say that are going to go to the parties "the end of the world."
"Maybe call someone from friends, to laugh together," commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student.
