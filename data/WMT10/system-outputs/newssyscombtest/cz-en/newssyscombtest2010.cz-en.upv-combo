The lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliéry
The barren slopes not worry about just krkonošským vlekařům.
The lack of snow discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and boarding houses.
It is therefore in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms for all winter dates, including the Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a large number of visitors at our website.
People pass through the shall record prices, but so far not afraid made to order order.
And if we call so now ask if we are will be this year's Christmas in the snow or mud, "said the operator an information portal Spindl.Info Martin Jandura.
Who wants to stay in a New Year's Eve in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, I would hesitate to order not hesitate.
Who who prefer saving money and the quality of accommodation is for him to take second place, he may still try to wait a couple of days wait.
Špindlerovští hotels still offer on New Year's Eve mostly a weekly stays.
I think they will try to give for a while, but then they go and go for a shorter period period.
And then they will be free rooms quickly disappear, "he estimated Jandura.
Free beds in all winter dates still offers vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in Christmas week, which is not yet vyprodán.
Even half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That's why we have tailor a cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute, "said the director Peter Ingtoursu Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in Giant Mountains vrchlabská travel agent office still offer, too, but there are fewer vacancies.
Well at disposal also the first two days of February, the other winter dates are sold on average.
This year interest in the winter stays affects the that in the Giant Mountains is still not snow.
People take a wait-and-see approach, if you wish.
No one wants to spend the end of the year without the snow on the snow.
If during the week, snowy slopes, vyprodají even Christmas, "says Schiefert.
On the contrary, slightly better than last year's the hotel rooms Horizont in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We're about five percent cent better.
On New Year's Eve and on Christmas we have the last few of places.
The big interest is about the Polish holidays in January and is sold sells well said the director of the best peckého Karel Rada.
Eighty the percent of the New Year's Eve and stays hotel occupied by Omnia in the central parking lot in Janské spa.
On the contrary, Christmas remains in the latest hotel janskolázeňském even half of the beds available.
Pleasantly pleasantly surprised us this year in January, which we already have at this moment occupied of about 60 percent.
A little less is a bit February, but as soon as the of snow, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains must still rise rises, said the hotel manager Omnia Eric Sporysch.
However, the on presents the snow krkonošští so far must have to go.
On Thursday, Thursday's cool, if there are any the mountains should be snow on the mountains.
But then again, has again come to the warming, informed Jiří Jakubský from Hradec workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
The US is the mother of wisdom
It is funny, with what a schoolgirl snaživostí Barack Obama, the president with a reputation as the smartest, repeated in the Afghan the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the stupidest.
When he finally vypotil out his expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that it over from of Bush's Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only in the text itself uses the word several times turnover as in Iraq, but he did not hesitate even to use the name of Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of its own declaration:" The new way forward ".
Three three years ago, he criticized Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq beset by civil war as "irresponsible and in the consequences of catastrophic decision
The subsequent months have shown however, that the Bush strategy based on a recommendation from field commanders was the only possible and veleúspěšnou so that today in the intelligence on Iraq at all
Bush's reputation improvement, but objectively he left his successor a much more grateful default situation than was be expected.
In Afghanistan he hopes Barack Obama in hopes that the miracle again.
The increase in military contingent asked him again asked field commanders, in particular the top commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal which even despite subordinačním practices criticized harshly the shooter in the White House.
He asked 40 thousand men in order to break the situation for the better.
The president of the three months hesitated, but nothing better accrue, and so at least the general 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe could to squeeze out the promise of a further 5 thousands, even though he initially originally counted at least 10.
On the for the Obama Obama's strategy seems to be his intention to begin withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan already for 18 months and end this process within three years. of Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the increase in same fruit as the same procedure as in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years is the Iraqi society is relatively well ordered, its leaders to honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the opposite sign - for one could not count on and no agreement not non-compliance.
Wrong under these conditions, prepare the Afghan security forces used day to change day master on the Lord, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally based, will remain just potěmkinovou village, for which will continue to spread patriarchal tribal relations.
balance of interests of various ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to nepřehlednosti ratios, which further complicate the Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither the establishment of "akceschopného state", which is a minimalist objective of the entire operation, it not look like all too real.
Timing of Obama's strategy at the time horizon strikes his voluntarismem.
For the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believe in that sending soldiers into a war in order to "an return home will cause here made a miracle, can only soul romantic romantic, the facts untouched.
From a political point of view, is to setting a date for withdrawal of troops by the Taliban it will be seen as an implicit recognition of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is nearing the
European politicians can't not and do not want to explain to voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush
Another factor capable of radically to intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions on the Iranians do not will arises from the United States přetěžká question of whether not to try to solve the problem of the military force.
to reply to it, it will be just at a time when under Obama's America to the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only politics for Barack Obama is the fact that the presidential election three years and therefore there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total flop flop.

It was Start again but again unsuccessful and the shot known as the type "Bulava", which was originally to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence at the tests missiles on the success of the test flights the effect.
Bulava majority at all nevzlétla or damaged in the air.
In Russian newspaper was the "Bulava" writes as the "rocket, which rocket not fly."
The rocket which don't fly but shines
This in order for the 13th experiment took place at initially normally.
at the end of the flight there was again to technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" taking off from a nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which went below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of allows the firing be fired from the vessel which is in the move, and at the same time submerged.
It it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by the unidentified flying object was actually broken "Bulava".
Indeed, the Norwegians from the first moment they had no doubt that it is a Russian rocket.
The generals this time the generals and that we cannot speak clearly about the failure.
The first two stages the and an accident to hit the third third.
In previous cases, the engines in the first instance.
if completely flawless not may not one been a test for the failed leadership of the Ministry of Defense considers that only six out of thirteen.
Almost 50 success rate the generals filled with optimism and so still claims that the "Bulava" would one day fly without problems and that even can carry up to ten nuclear blocks of a maximum total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

The management of Nosovice Hyundai with the unions agreed to cancel all of overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným overtime trade unions on Monday a strike emergency.
It confirmed Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
Management, however, wants to trade union leaders to agree even on one Saturday this year's Saturday shift.
We can not resign in our production schedule, that it is essential, therefore, was designed to be voluntary overtime on Saturday, 19 December with the result that would have made two shifts, said Vaněk.

Either you leave to pay premium for overtime or may choose the may on 28 December, and thus have a day to extend the Christmas holidays, said Vaněk.
In addition, all employees Saturday shift will get paid for the fare and lunch lunch.
Whereas the overtime was nejurgentnějším and from the point of view of the comments and complaints trade unionists, and employees protesters employees, last week stopped production production, so the management yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect to the abolition of all any overtime for the month of December, he said Vaněk.

Czech discovery: a substance that works on 'hardy' viruses HIV
A team of Czech and German scientists testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it works and the viruses that have acquired immunity against drugs immunity.
This fact in some cases outweigh the fact that the compound on a normal variant of the virus is as strongly as some already available drug.
The disease AIDS can not cannot be cured.
However, patients can significantly extend the life of a combination of drugs that prevent the reproduction of HIV in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of propagation of the virus has also resulted in the development of the so-called resistant viruses against which the drugs was ineffective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
Have Proved that a substance called metalokarborany acts on a protein responsible for the reproduction of the virus HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds boron boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus otherwise than all today used drugs, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In his work scientists are come with the new ’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their ties to the viral protein.
Metalokarborany have a unique three-dimensional structure: two cage cages of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked by a metal, in this case cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein HIV, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV proteázou caused by the HIV virus would not ripe infectious viral particles.
When we stop HIV protease, and stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In the work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describe a series of compounds in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) linked a short organic chain, which is systematically altered.
A slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of anti HIV protease been tested in vitro tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as the clinically used drugs, but its effect does not for resistant variants against which are used drugs are often ineffective.
A unique mechanism of action and also its other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications of the metalokarboranů is interesting compounds for further research to the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pauline Řezáčová, head of the Laboratory Structural Biology Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and molecular genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the sake of the budget. ODS to has embarked on Fischer, that will prevent
The of the ODS Mirek Topolanek by the approved budget for next year as "awesome" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer Fischer, he should consider the further existence.
The Expression of the ODS prime minister called for a strong statements.
He said that the time for analysis.
ODS chairman Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats the Green Party and the ODS Party obviously doesn't not work.
The Prime Minister, according to Nečas must decide whether it intends to rely on the House of the minority, which regards the fight with the growing deficits, or for him to remain in office with the help of parliamentary left.
Access ODS and social democracy on the issue of public sector deficits is a fundamentally different, said Nečas.
The House on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House had the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of the government proposals to address social democracy was that by increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
ODS Before the vote left the hall, comply with the wishes of the government so that the revised budget is less bad variant than the budgetary temporary
disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation even
Nečas is convinced that if a Janota seriously threatened to leaving the function in the case of the adoption of the amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech television Janota ordered on Monday after the government of the Prime minister.
He indicated suggested that time is considering further remain in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If the Fischer is for another fight with the deficit the budget deficit, in according to the Nečas in government what to do nominanti Social Democrats, who pushed through changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also be to say that he would if the House approves the further laws increasing the deficit, such as those relating to sick health, pensions, or an amendments to the Staff of the law.
Topolánek: Ministers ministers nominated ODS guilty
It is a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The Ministers nominees ODS haven't done anything wrong, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
He reminded that on several ministries are in náměstkovských features people hlásící to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if the Fischer decides to resign the principle of the fight with the amount of the government deficit, "is is perfectly logical and correct that against on left-wing majority which is currently in the Commons
Then said he but can not count on support from the tolerance Democrats and civil tolerance.
I hadn't not thought about it, and when it is the current, so that you will spend, he told reporters in the House of Defense Minister Martin Barták, which the government was nominated the the Civic Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon flew at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister stepped ODS
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would seem on Wednesday in the House apparently voted against the amended budget, if the Prime Minister of the Civil Democrats explicitly requested that the adoption of the budget allowed.
I feel like orphans, we are not small children, then responded to the question of whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget the absence of the President of the parties in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I have not noticed that my voice was missing.
When I was giving up the mandate, so I knew that in the coming months will be bolševizaci the House and destruction of all positive, he alone Topolanek.
Under to the new of procedure will be less trains for almost the same fares
Czech Railways from 13 December will cancel or reduce some of the less busy express and lokálky, other joint on the will strengthen the stronger.
The total range of traffic from the date of application of the new timetable will reduced in comparison with today by two percentage points.
Most of the fares, including the basic and a customer fare will not change.
More options related to the capital gain, for example, Ostrava, the track on this track add one set of trains.
On the contrary, the high-speed train ride to Bratislava.
Less trains go also on the route Prague - Písek - Czech Budějovice, significantly reduces the direct connections Praha Prague - Letohrad.
The regions are planning to track the largest reduction in traffic in the Králové region, a total of eight percent increase increase, on the other hand, can look forward to Prague and its surrounding areas.
Removes also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - Czech Budějovice and operation of several trains on the route Prague - Písek - Czech Budějovice is limited only to certain days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of the new direct flights from Prague to Prague, today must to switch trains in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of peri-urban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
long-haul flights to the capital city will go at the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava SC and trains and to Šumperka / Jeseník will go at two-hourly intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December passengers .
This year's bill for the regional rail: about 200 million more
Fast Rychlíky orders and paid the Ministry of Transport, the total to cover the so-called can be proven runways next year, four billion crowns, as well as this year. Local ordering the total pay for them next year, eight billion crowns, with less than three billion regions will contribute
This year are regional trains about 200 million more expensive.
I have train and express the have newly concluded a ten-year contract, the contract has always been a contract for one year.
The the system pochvalují, and therefore presumably to increase in the prices of an overwhelming majority of tickets.
The will occur only in for one network tickets ČD Net and cheap Internet ticket eLiška.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of ČD Net increase of 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
Price price will be based on the distance travelled, yet was for the travel between any regional cities uniform and was 160 crowns.

Vaccination against will be free of charge and optional
Vaccination against since January .
to be the first for family for free of and at the same time, optional.
But there are voices reverberating that it would be compulsory vaccination more effective.
The Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumokokům peak.
Pharmaceutical Institute already set the maximum price of vaccines, which will pay for health insurance companies.
Experts have also have clear in the procedure for the vaccination.
The new vaccination
The free vaccines charge for children in August
From January may be free of charge vaccinated against pneumokokům children who were born last year 2 August and later.
The condition is that still does not get even one dose of the vaccine.
Who began to vaccinate last year or earlier he must pay for himself and other booster.
The first dose of vaccination must be made between 3 and 5 month the age of the age.
Last year, voluntarily left their children vaccinated against pneumokokům a quarter of families.
Parents while paid 1600 crowns per one dose and more.
Youngest the for vaccination of the youngest children are need four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies shall issue on the vaccine doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year.
But on the treatment that children without vaccination needed.
Yet worth all the vaccination of children was about 500 thousand a year.
vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janotovým package.
The pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear ear, but also a serious infections including zánětů brain fever and blood poisoning.
The pneumococcal infections in our for the year will die in hospitals to 28 children under 10 years years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced by the vaccination of children against pneumokokům around in 40 countries.
The vaccination will be compulsory?
At the same time, but there are views in the future could be the vaccination mandatory.
From January to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
vaccination would be better to he for example, the head of the civic association Unmute Rudolf Kalovský.
His association promotes pneumococcal vaccine in the long term.
Experts at the international conference which our associations participated they were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that's the way that now we have to get in, said Kalovský.
The Ministry of Health but the vaccination against change want to change.
At the moment about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil .
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The President of the practical children's doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that the voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If they vaccinated all the children vaccinated, it could be considered to a reduction in the number of booster "In a situation where this vaccine is so high amount amount, quite we understand the political decision that vaccination was started as a voluntary," says, of course, Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that their infants to vaccinate against pneumokokům from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents.
Vaccination against pneumokokům is a breakthrough in that it was the first area the vaccination of children be borne by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should be spending money on prevention, save it for further treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the substance
But it is worried about the practical children's which relate to doctors the shopping purchasing vaccines.
According to the original intention of the vaccine to purchase insurance companies and doctors would receive just as they become adds substance to the other vaccinations.
Some But however, MPs are feared that they could give insurance companies the money from the health insurance
Doctors will therefore have to buy the substance and wait for until they are insurance companies.
According to estimates by individual child physician doctors to invest in vaccines 40 thousand a month, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy at all, says Cabrnochová.

It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss voters called for a ban on the building of minarets and in generally spread spreading alarm reports the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and about whether may that Muslims can integrate Muslims - and whether to integrate - into one of the open secular society continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became the artist's last works, "Why the French do not like scarves on his head (2006), this elegant and discussed a study on the issues that divide and employ the country for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt still today.
The last book Mr Bowen has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know not only what politicians and the media said about Islam in France, but what actually happened in the base.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which are now taking care of 5 ÷ 6 million of French Muslims, which Mr Bowen called "Islamic areas'.
is a good listener, reproduces the debate between teachers and students on issues that is most worried
Should a Muslim enter into matrimony in the mosque or at the City hall (or in both places)?
He should be taught on the development of young Muslim and gay rights?
It may be a Muslim to marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Muslim has the right to use Muslim zájmově oriented banking system if it wants to get a mortgage?
It's is these seemingly mundane issues which are discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than the political dramas which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, including the Ramadana, Arab Arab, Muslim explorer and academic, who was born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open a debate on how you can also be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have arguments for all their custom.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the actual idei French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists with that Mr Bowen conducted interviews, on the doměnce that this is a counterpart Selafiho Sunni supporters of Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is small, but affects the European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
It Wonders how far they are French politicians (and intellectual elite that so doggedly defends the general public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is of the opinion that Muslims are in matters of faith may have less experience than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make the historic compromise with secular republikánstvím.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found "tightening screws values."
It may be a Muslim Frenchman? After reading this book, book may have a tendency to say "yes, but not now."

Certain charges has not been made but according to the Cuban rights may be a Cuban citizen or a stranger imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled as "dangerous".
All the so-called kontrarevolucionářské activities, which include mild protests and critical paper, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-graffiti graffiti and speech are considered to be serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogující community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchezovou, who often writes about how she and her husband followed and harassed by government agents.
Mrs Sánchezová repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to take the prices, but the it was denied permission.
The detention of the American suppliers may be the result of the growing tensions between the communist Castrovým brother, the ruling in Cuba, and the Obama administration, which was monitored as a "delaying tactics" in improving relations with the island.
As the first report on the imprisonment of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government will take concrete steps, such as the release of political prisoners and create more space for the opposition, the United States take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, even although they are new and sought-after commodity in a country where the average wage of state employees is 15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year; these are used mostly prpo sending textovýchg because 15-minute phone call would cost more than one daily wage.

Pakistani administration rozkrývají conspiracy conspiracy, concerning the broadcasting of men into in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of the conspiracy relating to the deployment of five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of the American and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorists which he's on the Internet and finds radicalized young men.
Investigators said the searched for a gray rebel personality, known as Saifulláh, who invited the men to Pakistan after it first appeared, when one of these men published a comment, the authorising terristické attacks Ma website videostránce YouTube.
Saifilláh took over leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get into remote areas of Pakistan in the zone of indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaida Qaeda and its training camps for training terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence official who submitted a report on the case said on Saturday that Saifulláh was unsuccessful in reconnaissance commanders al-Qaida and that the men were part of an attempt the CIA infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were off after a few days to the eastern district Sarghoda, far from the mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were seen as a troops.

The official said that the men were not deterred and still trying to obtain consent to gain access to the camps of Qaeda, when they were arrested by the power of law.
The case of the five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned the FBI - underlines the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important to determine who is trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001 2001, the U.S. intelligence service attaches the highest priority attempts on the location of the human resources to al-Qaeda.
Náboráři organizations operate as a vyřazující those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.

But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the US, said that the terrorist groups will also become in recent years, significantly more cautious in recent to that came up to them, because the American intelligence agencies to experts on their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already so much Mr Kohlmann Kohlmann.
This model is one of those which is far more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanded called climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets this Saturday and pressed for stronger action on climate change from the negotiators in the city center Bella.
The protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists placed several small bombs near a group of government buildings in the centre of town.
On the day when the minor incident occurred in the talks on climate change, which sponsored the UN-sponsored, thousands of activists walked through the city and carried banners with English inscription "This is not a planet B" (i.e., the second-rank) and one in španěltštině, which read "Earth says .
Protest took part in several celebrities, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensenové, which stated that she to the birthplace of his mother in Peru and gave me information about the dismal state of the country, which involved the impact of climate change, which still occurs.
That's part of the reason why we decided to connect to this great march - through the world and to appeal to the leaders of the world to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, can not be avoided. avoid.
Police prevented the protesters to converge to the center of Bella and said that it had arrested 19 persons, in the first primarily because they either deployed mask masks or carry a pocket knife.
These activities are under Danish law during demonstrations banned.
According to one of the spectators, who did not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů climate change activists disguised as athletes and in black suits and several bombs near the main channel, which is located near several ministries.
Agitovali buildings, he said zahajivali flares, but followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is likely to entered into the consciousness of key officials such as Su Weie, the chief Chinese negotiator on climate climate.
When he was asked whether it demonstrations a constructive impact on the international negotiations, said the English "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of (actually it's something you realize).
Then he continued in čínčtině and said, "because the scene is large, I can not hear what's going on out
He whether the march of pain or helpful depending on the outlook for each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.

The date of the test revealed the persistent racial differences
Federal federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of mathematics it was a welcome element of good news about the public school district of Columbia.
Even Although the district lags far behind the country's highly systems systems, the certificate showed greater progress for pupils fourth and osmých classes in the last two years than in the cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National Center for progress in the are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameričany and white students and both the page after page of local and national national.
The average result of white pupils students classes of District of Columbia for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their peers nrůstu occurred only by three points from 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge economy actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress on the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a statistically insignificant one point of 245 to 245.
The average result for white students was not included in the results of the test because the sample size was not big enough.
Image in term of six years is not very encouraging.
The difference between white and black pupils students fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP was first made in the district was 60 points scale (262 ku 202).
Even Although the result in children from oboiu groups improved during this period, the difference is hardly approached 58.
Some advocates of education in the district in the last week expressed that the results, the secretary oslavované Michelle A. Rheeovou and the Mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were for white students rozsáhleji stimulated where there were already high results.
That would imply that we increase the the aid of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, "said Jeff Smith, executive director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality vdělávání in the district.
I'm not jumping up and down for of the diffusion of two or three points, a member of the committee member D.C. Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often kritizujíce management style of management Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that the report on the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is clear that always want to see the virtues and I respect that.
But what is horrible that we not pay almost no time and energy that was to be paid to pay our middle education.
Mrs Rheeová said that the district is continuing in the search for better ways of addressing the needs of the students with low results.
Thus, for example, are some of the teachers are trained in the use of the new curriculum is read, Wilson system reading, aimed at students in higher grades of primary schools and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in his kolní kariéřea significantly lag behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics curriculum and teaching math in sixth grade, emphasizing the games and experience of real life that which into in the district under the former Director Clifford Janeyiho can be attributable to the progress NAEP, which has been the subject of a report last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and implement out the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the level of the class, said Rheeová.
Others said that the results of the NAEP clarify the question of whether Mrs. Rheeová can continue in the overall system performance and to provide more money and resources for schools with low performance, which is necessary for of the difference.
It's a definite dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, where she studying the results of the tests in urban areas.
conventional procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So can focus bring the political repercussions, which is directed against the important agenda.
But the complaint but of the other city managers who are trying to keep the middle prúměr between white and black.
We have to focus on the building of a system of large schools.
We have utužit affinity of our schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, they can rest assured that their children will be provided an excellent public schooling.
Mr Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, he said in an interview this week that an essential element of the reduction in the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district to place the validity of the schools.
You have to get up to 200 days to be to push through the changes, said Mr Janey, who concluded entered into a contract with its teachers last school year in the length of the 185 days, which is considered to be a "flag" for the search for a larger increase in the next year.

In fact, fact of this fifth generation of Spanish students from the college - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central America, came to the United States without finished completed high school.

Those who have achieved higher education say that they a natural náklonpost to the school and congenital assertiveness and desire to succeed.
Many also had parents who set their children high goals and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the American education education.

The Iraqi Ministry of Oil has reached agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Regardless of the fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get the major oil companies to rebuild their its infrastructure during the two auctions, which took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements concluded by the Iraqi Ministry of oil industry with foreign oil companies, which suggesting that the Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are prepared to play a significant role in the reconstruction of Iraq's oil industry, paralyzed decades of war and sanctions.
American companies had left with capital participation on two of 10 fields fields.
Seven US companies pay for their participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has lost bid.
Two U.S. companies have reached agreements on the field, which was auctioned in June.

Iraq finally opened the door after six years of war and American companies here in the first place on the way Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news news.
It will be a long time before something else will be in Iraq for sale.
Concerns about concerns, highlighted by coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the American army is likely to discourage American companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has the third largest proven reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
US companies have in some cases at a disadvantage, in especially the Chinese and other governments government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they are not accountable to shareholders.
The Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc.. were the only U.S. companies, which have entered an agreement with the Ministry.
Leading American companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of oil industry and to offer technical assistance in the past recent years, left empty-handed.
The Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that have been committed at the end of this week.
The China National Petroleum Corp. contributed to the menus on more contracts than any other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for the two main fields.
We all know that China is seeking to become the main economic as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the Ministry of industry Assam Jihad.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and to meet their commitments to Iraq.
The companies, which have been selected for the submission of tenders, which were then compared to the price of a barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for the strengthening output above the current level in each field.

Senior delegate of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he wanted to withdraw from his of his post in March and end a stormy term of office which was by allegations of widespread corruption in the election of a president in Afghanistan, supported by the United Nations.
The Eide departure occurs because the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan.
UN Delegate said that he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the timetable for the US for a reduction in the state, which starts in 18 months should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO nations to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal Afgáncům that they to have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed for the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The the of the armed forces must be copied on the civilians, he said.
Eide said that resign, but that simply fulfil a promise he gave made to his family in March 2008, in Kabul spends only two years.
He said that he wanted to report to the UN.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now said that would need time for find a replacement.
As I said, it is high time to look after the said "said Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.

Officials said that will be decided between Staffanem di Mistura, who has a Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN Nations mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhennem, a Frenchman who before led the UN peacekeeping operations.
Eideho position in Afghanistan was tested after his former agent, Peter W. Galbraithovi, who was accused in September President Hamid Karzáím, who won the presidential election of masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied those allegations, but said that the allegations Galgraitha - which was released - "definitely damage the mission, because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said that the proposed a meeting with the chief representative of citizens for the coordination of relief efforts for the leadership of US forces in Afghanistan.

Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose on Iran significant additional due because of a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who speaking to a group of about 300 American troops in northern Iraq during a weekly trip to areas where the is war in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, said in response to an inquiry of a soldier on the likely evolution. ¨
One of the things that depend on me, is that if I learned something from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is an unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration will be decided on a package of sanctions which could hit the military and political elite, but Gates indicated that some of these sanctions could also affect the ordinary Iranians.
He said that "a package of incentives and barriers" would require to persuade forced the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its people will be extremely suffer" sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged European leader in warning that Iran will bear the serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the Committee of the for nuclear safety and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October indicated that he wants to return to talks on reducing their nuclear programme and agreed to provide a substantial part of its stocks of enriched uranium in return for badly needed fuel for the reactor to implementation of medical research.
The administration has planted for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to allow time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran is stepping down from the interim agreements - partly because the expert, because irámské leadership is divided on whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, as the Iranian obstinacy to the international community in the case of some proposals, which was agreed at the beginning of October, I think it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the path which is not the terminology of additional sanctions against the said Gates.
President Obama has set for December 31 December deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before returns to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degradujícími sanctions
In its opinion, issued in New York, iránská mission at the United Nations on Thursday condemned what she called "unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations" against some members of the Security Committee on the Iranian nuclear activities and said that he wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a reasonable long-term solutions.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before he flew to the region of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuku and Kurdish leaders in Irbilu.
There remains still a high tension between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority, in mainly because of the border, proprietary rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflicts to zabránlo delay the US plans to reduce the number of American troops from 115000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dampen concerns about the Kurdish concern from persistent depression. Official official quoted the US Gates when he told Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomiji in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you. "
In an ageing China, change course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which read that "Mother Earth is too tired to fund more children and one child moreover, means a grave also.
Then they got a lesson that when the official government positions in Shanghai, alarmována low birth rate and ageing population in their city, suddenly changed course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always spent all their time and energy to just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years manager of human resources resources, which has a 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of China's policy China have only one child was introduced and thereby created only two generations only the notoriously boubelatých and zhýčkaných children afektovaně dubbed emperors the country threatens the country's population crisis.
The average fertility rate fallen to 1.8 children per couple in compared with six than vpolitika vsoupila force, according to the UN figures.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above, predicts that the will grow from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31,1 percent in 2050. is far above the overall average of around 20 percent.
The imbalance is more rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above accounted for almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai municipal Commission for population and family planning Commission said, many couples have children, to help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduction the status of the workforce in the future."
He says that it's about "being old, that does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden.
The gradual
How was been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
The pair, which violated the policy, face enormous fines - up to three times their annual salary in some areas - and discrimination at work.
China's official places advocated policies that helped the country avoid prevent critical of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned to enforce the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forcing pregnant women in the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men against women.
In recent years, population officials were progressively milder in its opinion on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule rule, povolovali výce exceptions - including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and in cases where a man and a woman were only child - and in 2007 to mitigate diction their passwords, promote the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of population research Beijing said that officials of the central government has previously debated the more radical changes such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Šanghai became the first Chinese city, which launched an aggressive campaign for incitement to more births.
Almost overnight the posters posters, parents to have only one child, and replaced with the regulation, describing in detail how it would be entitled to have a second child and how to apply for a
The city administration has sent officials to plan families and volunteers to so that they can meet with couples in their houses and vsouvali leaflets under the
Also promised to provide emotional and financial counseling for those who have decided to have more than one child.
The response was cool, said officials for planning families.
Zarmucující response
Although officials in a rural town near Shanghai experienced an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most urban precincts reported changes.
Urban district with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births born in the town in 2010 was still expected to only around 165 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee for family planning in Shanghai čtvti Caolu said that financial considerations were have probably the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years old, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children and they being legally allowed to
But like many Chinese, who have only a lack of health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without dociální safety network could be the choice of irresponsible irresponsible.
People in the West consider the one child is wrong as a matter of legal question, says Yang, a structural engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child.
Yes, we were been deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's is about money.
Other couples the psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, manager of human resources resources, says that they want only one child, because she also was an only child: "We were the focus of our families and all of us us.
We were not used for the provision of care and in fact we did not want to worry about of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who own translation company, has put it much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové middle-class parents of the middle who lower birth rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30letí waxing consult on parents as is the first days číského experiment with capitalism and do not want this kind of živita for himself, he says.
Just one child places enormous demands on time parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice for at least two years of his social life.
Then there are disputed issues propstoru - "You have to rebuild your apartment - and the strategy -- you must have a resume prepared at the time when a child is 9 months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends he wants to be content with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many victims.
The UN group the outlined a plan for to reduction of emissions.
by UN conference on climate change - largely characterized neukázněnými position and mutual osočováním - again on Friday focused on the release of the document, which proposes ambitious reduction the of greenhouse gases over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the immediate term.
The text which may provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, emissions, stresses the remaining obstacles as well as the way forward.
But it was to important progress in the negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who come to Copenhagen next week.
UN Working Group created an ad hoc the this text subtly indicates how much money rich countries should provide the poor to cope with global warming in the short term and long term.
And provides a full range of options for key issues, including how to develop and manage the emerging economies in order to reduce their carbon output of carbon and what should be the upper limit global temperature increase in global which will be still able to tolerate.
This dodábá process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the Washington Representative of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who suggested šestistránkový document abridgement of the 180 pages of text from the meeting to focus on what a top official on climate change at the UN climate Yvo de Boer, described as a "big picture".
Outlines the outlines of a possible agreement in which could be industrial nations to reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while the main developing countries could reduce their emissions during this period reduced to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union discussed on Friday a promise to provide 3.6 trillion dollars over the next three years to help poorer countries to adapt to climate change - from the floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still but on Friday said the same type of verbal fireworks which prevailed at the talks in the last week.
The US special envoy for climate change Todd Stern dismissed the speech, calling for mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions for industrialised countries compared with voluntary for the main emerging economies, if would not be financed by the developed world.
The signaled that the Obama administration a harder line against China go Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not to the treaty without the transfer of the major developing countries and the implementation of action, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not sufficient to ensure the limitations and should be examined by external observers.
Stern made this comment about an hour after the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the main U.S. negotiators on climate issues that either a lack of common sense or exceptional irresponsibility" led earlier in the week to the statement that the United States would not help financially China in to to deal with global warming.
With the future economic path of the world's major powers at stake, both within out inside the developing world as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States on the performance of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point the fact that two of the most influential countries in the world to ignore scientific imperative for the implementation of the action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate of Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of omezováníí greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in search seeking Order to prevent the large issuers responsibly in their actions.
It's is clearly a game that new economic hegemony is developing, he said Ulate, which also serves as a regional in the adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of conservation.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné effects of climate change have indicated that they wish to continue a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the major participants said that the best outcome of the talks will be the political agreement.
The alliance of small island states which has 43 members, has created a draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international negotiations on climate change in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations caused a political tlkak on the whole process in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations to a new urgency as the delegates focused on the fact that have most of the remaining contentious issues must be resolved before the heads of governments compete on the deal.
High-ranking officials, such as for the Indian Minister of environmental protection Jairam Rameš and Chinese Deputy Minister stepped out of the aircraft and the halls Bella Center to a closed door meetings and conferences so they could chart a new claims, which will be assessed next week.
Total rozsáhlost Assembly - where 13,000 people a every day to and from the convention center, the guitar playing activists inscenovali at night ironizující spectacle of countries the countries, which believed that be sent, put them were and on the transmission of proposals from hand to hand on the paper rather than by electronic - controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only an extension: in Copenhagen were present at almost all of the key ministers and earlier in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We got to the high category, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for global policy at for international protection nature conservation.

The first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour this Monday feelings
At 5: 13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness of the departure of the train, which meant a revolution transport in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country reaches a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashfordu in Kent to London St Pancras and beyond the distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmesové and got into the first high-speed passenger trains outside lLndýn.
He hopes that the new service, where appropriate, the Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connects large urban agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland with London.
Neglected stagnant water should shorten transport times in passenger traffic and trade trips and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate the congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties to get for this vision.
But dozens of bilinů pounds needed for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the distortion of the environment now the building of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide a credible government study study, submitted its report to Lord Adonisovi 30 December, as stated Times.
He gave him a detailed map of the routes of the next stage of the planned high-speed Speed Network.
The new trace links London with the West Midland was designed to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where dopat would be on the propstředí could be problematic.
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final routes.
HS2 also expected to identify three options for extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will reply in the spring.
The preferred choice is konfikurace shape with one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The track should share with one near the Birmingham passing through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other, leading to the northeast in Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle over the Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems looks like it was the most effective choice," he said and a expert railways.
Once soon as is done, driving times between London and Edinburgh shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before the year 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make made of the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line has already proposed to hold the trains in the length of 400 m, which would have been able to carry 1100 people.
To to 18 trains could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve, the needs of up to 20 000 passengers per hour.
Due to capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded so that pojmula high-speed network.
Experts from železničníhoprůmyslu argues that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not to implement this scheme, but the extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the a final decision will not be before the general election.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should be build in parts.
Trains should be first put into service on the high-speed lines, but the existing lines north of Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered as a crucial points of contact for the transition from the aircraft to trains, reference point for the revolution on the rail.

The case Liliane Bettencourtové: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of state weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Baniera and the judgment whether he used state weakness of miliardářky to prepare it for a part of its capital, of which it blames her daughter Liliane Bettencourtová.
A photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for misuse of state weakness, which is a an offence for which a sentence in a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros.
This decision confirms that the process actually takes place in the case that can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which each a mother and daughter and fighting the management of L'Oreal cosmetics empire.
But 15 criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87 leté Liliany Bettencourtové, which should make the College of three doctors.
Heiress heiress and the main akcionářka L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such testing, certainly not on the terms offered by the prosecutors prosecutor in Nanterre during the investigation.
The Physicians who will be elected on Friday, should draw up a report on 10 March 2010 and at the same time to submit comment whether the Liliane Bettencourtová could be in a state of weakness, and in which the period.
I think that it undergo.
I talk to her speak, said after the hearing Mrs Bettencourtové lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
As as the lawyer Francois Meyers, Olivier Metznera, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
Two the two years since the only daughter Liliany Bettencourtové launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, whom they blame for years using the state of weakness of her mother, in order to obtain the gift of one billion euros in the form of checks, contracts for life insurance or images . masters.
But Liliane Bettencourtová always refused to that it would be a photographer, which who is regarded as a long-term friend, manipulated.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday's the speech of lawyers are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
The lawyer Bettencourtové submitted three letters which his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which it expressed their distrust of her husband Françoisy Meyers.
In a letter from the 2003, according to an attorney lawyer adds: "could you explain to my daughter that I wrote Banierovi for a period of 15 years, once or twice a day.
Ever since you got married, married with I could never talk " .
The prosecutor in Nanterre again found that the negotiations stěžovatelky is not justified, the more that the judge in these days of judge rejected its request for the initiation of a proceeding to the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourtová is fully able to participate in the court is not under the protection of or in custody.
No one else for it not to act for her, be confirmed representative the prosecution, Marie-Christine Daubigneyová.
The the Court decided that the validity of Mrs Bettencourtové-Meyersové expressed at the time of the opening of the process.
Managerial revolution or the end of the economic intelligence?
If nothing changes change in the management of large French companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was unnecessary.
For more than ten years is reminiscent of the behaviour of the management of large companies the employees access to business-to-consumer marketing before the revolution: the point is to identified them as with the "values" identified from the mountain, as was the case was past, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products which from the ideas of heads of factory technicians.
The fact that the customer has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies, companies marketing strategy conquest of the market revolution in the right direction ... even if the authoritarian efforts to impose the products different from customer preferences, regularly regularly!
Passive approach employees can lead to death demoralizaci.
suicides in at France Telecom, PSA and or Renault are only visible part of a much more general phenomenon phenomenon, which affects mostly managerial cadres.
The demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of the company, including research and development and, more importantly, the economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI "requires all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to predict anticipate" and requires from the staff of the commitments which are contrary with the revenue authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to bring workers at the center of the interest of the company as well as a client.
The relative usefulness of internal polls.
Internal polls - as the questionnaire submitted by the employees of the company Orange - will contribute to the revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, Unfortunately I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I convinced myself that, in the face of the new situation situation, the structure of the various returns back a priority to the what you always did!
Furthermore, because that authoritarianism, as one of the pathology of power, increases in proportion proportionately with the severity of their own failures.
Finally, as because most of the has a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates for engineers have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the of convenience of thought take the old behavioristickou theory, currently again "neurovědami" from the US and widely operated without too much knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media.
In that it is possible to move the "levers" (sic) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey of the Agency Ipsos on the site, which only strengthens the management staff in their position of mechanical management, unsuitable for today's world.
To identify and measure the factors mobilization.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of the modern enterprises, provides for the adoption of definitive final vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all the projects and practice management management: for the staff of the commitments to the will be possible only if they will seem like a clear means to achieve their dreams dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of the motivation of staff only in the study only functional analysis.
These studies have shown that evaluates their businesses on the basis of predetermined doxy, which will allow them to through the image which the company says, to assess what offers them to realize their life goals.
Thanks to identify and measure of these factors can mobilize managers to control, predict and pre-empted on its "social power", indicating and human its management of human resources "on the right track".
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered the day before in Oslo, satisfied with the fact that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2009 defended the concept of the "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who at first laughed at the price of Obama 9 October, this time a presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former candidate vice-presidential candidate in elections election in 2008.
I liked what he said, said Palin, muse of right-wing Republican Republican, for the USA Today, and added that she herself on the subject "sometimes necessary necessary" war expressed in his memoirs, which are based.
The war is of course, the last thing the Americans would like to have to job, but it is necessary.
All the terrorists is there to be the detained, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after its předchůdciGeorge W. Bush on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to explain his decision to send another 30 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, said that the president did in Oslo, "a very good job
I think that the speech was really very good, congratulated a former chairman of the House of Representatives, which in appreciate the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I felt this the speech as historic, historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio Takeaway "The Takeaway".
A former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the presidential elections in 2012, was delighted to see "leftist president," recalled to the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize, "that they would not be free and could transmit the price for peace, if the use of force exist.
According to Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama made "very American speech".
Not only introduced himself as a the "cosmopolitan" as always, but he as the American President and reminded Europeans that they live in a safe bubble bubble, which was created themselves, and that they don't do too much for it to be keep it" been taking credit
Among the few malcontents from among the right to the Bush era, a former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who described the speech as "humdrum, pompous and without inspiration inspiration," as stated on the website of the National Review Online.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is appalled at the sight of Barack Obama Obama, justifies the use of force.
"When the war packed into a container of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the print press is against the opinion of the President of opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times continues to be the award of the Peace Prize for Obama for reviewed his output as "nadvýkon" and even the speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo accords should serve as a guide to international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression "stated places a the California diary.
Obama Obama" speech what was to be said the New York Times, and a sign marked for the simple and instructive.

The new Silicon-Valley
For years was for a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the 10 districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was closely guarded location where is carried a secret weapons research.
Today it is considered to be the district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 miles from Moscow Center, the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are significant micro - and nanoelektronická research and production manufacturing centers.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští contacts with representatives of Frankfurt scientific center Riedberg - with university institutions and firms frankfurtského Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There has been a number of mutual visits and signed on Wednesday signed in Frankfurt and Zelenograd Ridberg on the on close cooperation
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, Smirnov in Frankfurt signed the head of planning Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, 2010 they'll go representatives FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in research on a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific scientific exchange
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZu companies will be allowed to implant in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, the Russian scientific companies want to get the contract in Germany.
Zelenograd is the major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the need to be Moscow Institute of electronic technology, large groups and Sitronics Rossijskaja electronics.
The District was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal literal translation of the "Green City") gained its name in the wooded hilly landscape, in which they are placed a research facilities.
Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 can't can not adequately prepare.
For fans of the project it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
All S21 is more than running the station, more than a monstrous building, which throws the capital of Baden-Württemberg on one decade in a desperate of chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the spirit of the years.
Hlavové station with the rails, which ended in the centre of city center, was then considered to be technical fossils of the 19th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, because it was the need for much time on přepřáhnutí locomotives from back to front.
Go, stop for a moment, go on - so it should work.
And that's why disappearing hlavová station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
Indeed, starting with S21, although the vision of the 1980's are no longer compatible with reality.
Ourselves very ambitious designers know that in Hessen and city bavorském is the start of construction of almost neufinancovatelné.
Since there are a modern shuttle trains and motor vehicles and control at both ends, they don't have problems with the station zajížděním and vyjížděním.
Yet: It starts with the Stuttgart 21, including a new track ICE to Ulm.
It that the and local politicians.
Track shall and because that the risks risk of an individual of the infrastructure project in the Republic be borne by the taxpayer and not the state concern.
Urban, the project is still in some way to apologize.
A a new urban space, which - if we to believe the computer images of - will contain many green.
For rail transport system is S21 harmful.
The station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980's - attributed the huge increase.
Then there was no competition from cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must to go but first primarily on the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is more environmentally friendly than the freight car on the road.
But the new line is not due to a sharp climb suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that the S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
In Švábsku should be good six billion euros.
This is the official number.
Experts consider to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will miss the finances to the next hub points and narrow space on the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport is sixty larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 miles long routes the valley of the Rhine.
Since 1987, on this route puts slow pace.
There would be a need for a push.
But S21 will be as a brake.
The track of the Rhine valley becomes neck bottle of international freight transport: transport in the heart of Europe.

More than a footnote to Herta Müllerové
To get into Germany and out of Germany's nice, almost no control "is the opening line of a poem poems poet Werner Söllnera, which in this torn piece of with experience with přicestováním one dissident who gained freedom, freedom came at the same time but for their language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in rumunském Romanian he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a one of the children's book publishing, 1982 then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was honored the different literary prices, 1993 lectured poetry at the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University legendary, and since 2002 is head of the forums fora literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A considerable commotion took care of last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, where which were a "German literature in Romania in the mirror and a cracked mirror its security act".
Obviously uncomfortable and Söllner left a Söllner declaration in which of fellow writers Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuthem Frauendorferem admits to working as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner won in 1989 the German language prize.
Attempts at he apparently began quietly, first in 1971.
I said Söllner, "meaning someone who did not sufficiently attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize Hertě Müllerové and its bezpříkladným literary settlement the mechanisms of the dictatorial government's literary scene, and particularly a community of German authors originating in Romania, shaken case that indicates the depths and political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is, at least if it can be said to the current state of knowledge, only the offender but is also a victim.
In the Securitate secret agent Walter played a role, said after the granting Söllnerově Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence on a secret agent Walter.
"Vysekával me in all the important points for him, he says Markel.
He Has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before this audience unexpected, but not totally surprising confession of former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müllerová wrote in July, when reading their own deeds, 914 parties that Germany was a pleasant reserve for Securitate Securitate.
Concerned, it can be assumed they be speculate, and in some cases I know that the name is hiding behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, meanwhile, has since become a look at a components of the is handling of the of the Securitate very diffuse.
In the last few years has been systematic education and restricted.
One of the Birthlerových offices, which corresponds to the National Council for processing components of the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more slowly.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the management of folders.
That former members of the Securitate in Romania still still a big influence, documented after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müllerovou one conversation in which one of the former bosses of the Timisoara expressed on the awards dismissively.
He has psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Power potupení here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that the case Söllner, as in the context of zamlčeným guilt, the inevitable questions.
Why now? Who who hurt? Specific responses to the granting leaves to expect expected that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more the desire for knowledge rather than those pertaining guilt and shame.
The work of Herta Müller's work, which yesterday received the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated the Champions League
It looked as if he came clean clothes agent representative from a Christmas party which the sporting goods distributed sweets, when he a quarter of an hour after midnight přivolaného the Mercedes C Class new coach VfBr Christian Gross, accompanied by orange-colored bag sponsor. ¨
The man with the bald spot for him after he had left him, still in a foreign city.

The joy of třeskavého taking Babbelova successor will therefore be maintained.
Not only for the alleged healer is uncertain stuttgartským professionals added during a short period of self-confidence, willingness to deploy and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them that they focus on their strengths and I them to be more explained the healer souls Gross so simply simple-sounding successful recipe that but for the action of a therapist Babbela but did not have any effect.
Spurred a certain magic, he admitted Babbelův adherent Jens Lehmann, "when in football comes a new they are sometimes things that you did not see as possible."
Sami Khedira who after mnohatýdenní break caused by injury, became, thanks to its dynamism as the best player on the pitch, he tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" fresh "fresh wind" and working procedures of the new manager: "He's is a man who is a radical and requires discipline. .

For Babbela obviously missing.

VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
As Gross even want neither players and managers overestimate the victory against a weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.

And the President Horst Heldt reminded that they has achieved one goal in the season, but the other is still far away.
We're not out of the hump.
That on its 40th birthday celebrated 40 even after the first domestic victory after three months, was due to weekend events, which recently revived in the form of a television interview with goalie Jensem Lehmannem just before the start of the game.

The board of of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure pubertálních fans.
And that was canceled his day off after the game, Lehmann described as a sign of the lack of sovereignty and envy.

Babbel and his assistants were "a large share of the success," says Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and a man with a plastic bag agrees.

Case Kundúz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the of the Greens Jürgen Trittin called because of bad information about the affairs of Defense as a liar.
The SPD and the Linke the Chancellor invited to submit an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin -
The Minister to the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "knowingly false", said the head of the fraction of Greens Jürgen Trittin in Saturday news agenda ARD Tagesschau "Tagesschau".
Call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order to the killing was issued in breach of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report, which was NATO, which had read Mr Guttenberg said Trittin.
On Friday it became clear that the attack was not only on the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two leaders of the Taliban.
In the American raid which claimed the German commander Kundúzu Colonel Klein, Klein investigation to NATO to kill or wound up to 142 people.
Green, the SPD and the Linke called on Saturday Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately expressed before the Federal Bundestag Saving and also clarify what he really knew Guttenberg about this event.
Mrs Merkel must explain whether he's strategy of targeted killings part of the Afghan policy the council - and, if the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and the intelligence of this new strategy approved, called Jürgen Trittin and a colleague from the Green Party Renate Künastová.

The worlds dreams
Some see the images in the waking state and hear voices that other people others see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication merge the boundaries between imagination and reality.
Until this occurs during sleep, everything is all
If we lying closed shut our eyes in a dark room, we may surround the wildest imagination and fantazijními delusions.
But who is experiencing in dream states of sees and hears things that others can see and hear is in today's the Western world mostly for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as a
But such images and voices are not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
Blame is our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there to take care of it that blend the border between the dream and reality reality.
Dreams dreams of the altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, at best, we call them a vision in the worse delusional.
Even if the initiator and the effect may vary, but however, vision mystičky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet New Carlos Castanedy, shamanic states of delirium, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise when the a derailment balance neuronálních transmitérů - especially the brain dopamine, serotonin and acetylcholine - and interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur very often in the schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity above it does not have much power
The link between the dreams and delusions of philosophers and doctors from by since antiquity.
Aristotle understood as a form of the dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychology, said in 1861 "great great similarity ravings with dream for the Sigmund Freud was a dream even psychosis, with all the nonsense, delusion, deception senses. the senses .
It is the autumn of 2001, Henning T. is amended in comic figure.
His body is a two-dimensional and brightly colored.
Gravity above him has no power, floating near the ceiling of the room.
Feels the nakopnutí.
Behind him the winged cloven figures with blood red blood-red-mouthed, cenící teeth.
Chasing him, him a the heavy, fiery boots, throwing him on the wall, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Loud, evil voices from the walls and on the radio.
I can not tolerate the voices that swearing and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, zauzlí into the loop and fastened it on a hook on the ceiling.
Stand scrambles to one speaker and you a noose around his neck.
Jumping.
Loop permits.
Learn, a chorus of voices tearing his eardrums, "go to the clinic and let treated!"
Today's Henning T. 40 years, has had six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first nearly 20 years ago.
They started running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoická psychosis, manic, it is also manic-depressive, he takes medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with their illness, three years is married.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people will get sick at least once in a lifetime schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is that the second most commonly treated of disease.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis can usually distinguish between internal and external world world, into přebuzeného condition which can lead to weeks, velikostním, vztahovým delusions or the illusion of persecution.
Especially widespread is hearing voices - voices that Command, comment or maintain dialogue.
Neither optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected is not able to distinguish between important from unimportant, the brain can not filter out spurious signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just as a dream opens the floodgates a barrage of ideas and fantasies which come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the body, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief of general University Clinic General university clinic in Heidelberg.
A schizophrenic is located in the centre of the stage, everything is meaning směřovaný at him.
At the same time, into a passive role, it happens like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and can is actively shape.
Schizophrenics is therefore often feel threatened, manipulated and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not usually possible of them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination
Otherwise than in a dream, says Fuchss, "but remains sensual and spatial structure of the fact that one sees in psychosis, a preserved."
The Wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality to the experience of is in real framework.
Scientists are still the puzzle as to why our brain is doing exactly the sort of twists.
The exceptional conditions for each person one lead to lose in the short-term relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone everyone, however, develop into psychosis.
It seems that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled people have minimal damage to brain damage.
We believe that in the early stage of development of the damage to the brain, for example, as viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a puzzle, as there is a failure of neuronal system, which in the long for years of not materialize.
The role also the effects of the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences can be psychosis, if it is to her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, because the transmission system.
When our brain zavař
Crazy is that psychotronici suffers suffer hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallowed expensive medication, others give money for drugs to get be he says a professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If the images we perceive as pleasant or unpleasant, is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten collects for ten years, reports on hallucinations and in the last year interpreted its results in a book "Die Welt irreale in unserem Kopf" (unreal world in our head).
Hallucinations hallucinations belongs to a typical accompanying phenomena psychoses, but also to the surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality or depression also often diseases like migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly halucinuje under certain conditions conditions, and the a healthy human brain.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of the ideas which are normally suppressed.
Arise when part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; if our brains zavař, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can run this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of the stress, worry about love or other more exceptional conditions.
In the most recent studies and up to one-third of respondents surveyed reported that at least once in your life experienced a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, lives in a small town in Pomerania and goes to the grammar school.
In fact, a normal girl.
If there were not the shapes and voices.
The recess, it may be that it appeals to Hulk with long, dark hair.
When he replies, they looking at her classmates with surprise - no one except her see and hear this boy.
This shy girl as stiff a dreamer, but Sarah K. knows it.
He's awake, hears and sees the boy, just as he hear and see a girl sitting next to him in the bench.
Even even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, is has the boy boy.
I'm crazy?, asks asks.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and disappears.
In the night are rather depressing appearances
They are often a burden.
When sitting in the class, not track how many times the teaching, because a teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains all other audible and visible on the board of the mathematical equation.
In the night are phenomena rather depressing.
While waiting in a dark room to sleep sleep, which is rarely and too late, often can not distinguish if he's awake or if asleep, if the images he sees grimacing, or a girl with bleeding wounds on the hands and feet are from her open or closed closed.
Leave me alone, shouting at the figures.
Parents and friends say anything about it, thought would about her that's was crazy.
The autumn of 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
Last year she graduated high school and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted on the internet psychologist Kasten, knows exactly that mad.
The images are also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or he is removed incentives it will have a high probability hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain then not have enough employment and old for his own amusement.
Sarah K., an only child, she was like a little girl fear of the other children, often played herself.
Her hallucinations began when in 13 13, she learned that the man who says dad from the days since she thinks is her own father.
Because the visual and visual hallucinations are active the same brain areas that process also real images and sounds, is for the people like Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from each delusion and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes takes place in the brain, also the reality there shows.
Hallucinations are also the images that will allow the brain, brain occur, so real "
Also late-night dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of delusion.
Hallucinations healthy people does not differ substantially from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike to the are mentally healthy people able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advise her patients to rate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
Border border between dreams and hallucinations
In our world concentrated too much on the consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, unfortunately majority patologizován, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor in Heidelberg and the psychiatric and clinic Clinic-Florence Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, útrpná disease, but it also provides the positives, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair.
The so-called oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of the consciousness to the dream.
Oneiroidní states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams, which is considered to be the real and can can't even distinguished from waking. state.
Oneiroidní state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, such as hepatitis polyradikulárním patients who experience fully conscious motor paralysis.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and herself, to be continued, the complete inability to move, be replaced by life life-threatening the real situation of your own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The type of the state between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with any situation, there is a change in the worlds, the real situation but zpřítomní the idea.
Intensive form of aid senses and the transfer of the senses in an intolerable situation, which allows people to their own ability to shape, during in an instant to a loss of consciousness.
All of this is real, and later in the memories
Also, the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen oneiroidní describes his experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Replacing heart) as a rescue of the soul.
He was 49 years old, when, after the operation valve surgery heart valves with subsequent heart transplant published his consciousness for several days track, with his body lay motionless in intensive care care.
Claussen plunged into a world he had created, visited a foreign time and place: the is becoming an old man upoutaným on the bed in a train the sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages between the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from the blood.
The him on a motorcycle to his their homeland, in a hospital bed surfs the firn in the Alps and meets the Korean mobster.
Completely immersed in an imaginary wrong, everything is fair, and later in memory.
These internal path for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, describes his experience.
In contrast to the dreams are memories of the mental disorders across the years and in the details clearly obvious.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience shatters the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní states, psychosis, hallucinations and drug intoxication, how fragile are also waking state our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, "may lead to distortion of what we call reality."
The fact that may also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
In the 27 to take over the children
The new head of publishing Kallen is a temporary solution: the long-term wants to Hubert Burda forward to his business into the hands of their two children, said Spiegel Spiegel.
Holding has also in the future include 100 percent family.
Hamburg - publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the long term, in the hands of their children.
Both children will inherit in 27 years and have a strong will to join the firm, says the man 69letý Spiegel.
The details are to we handled carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company, is be taken later.
The question of whether they have the ability.
It is not possible to take the lead 7500 employees their children if they are not sufficiently capable competent.
That would kill killed as children so the company.
Burda on Thursday announced that from January withdraws from the presidency of the Board of Directors, and appointed as his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
52 years Kallen's since 1999, Member of the board of directors for Burda.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the section added responsibility for the company's assets of and the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfera also direct marketing, Foreigners, printing and Finance.

Holding should in future include 100 percent family, says Burda.
With regard to the cases and Schickedanz, Schaeffler Burda expressed that neither the family businesses do not have confidence before the run-off: "It touched always been which companies that left been infected infect the desire of capital, which have speculated and thought that they may become major players.
It has never been my strategy.
He never had "dreams of a world power," says Burda.
do the as a political preceptor of this country, as was Springer, and I don't want to play the World League with the "Time", these shops are too big.
Promise FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, only serves to explore the mail, without the ability to view a type of annexes or surfing in the network.
Enjoyed their five minutes of fame in the US when Time magazine praised it as one of the products of the year.
It is difficult to see out but the idea may be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphonů Peek is characterised by a very low price and the monthly payments, less than half the amount payable for example, for a data plan for the iPhone.
After his success the company has started offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of permanently provided free data service, for which it is the necessary to pay for the six times amount.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday to the Le Web is the European version of the invention, and at the same time his third transformation.
Is is limited, as well as his American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The price for maintenance is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People passengers smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search café with WiFi (or Fon Fon), so they can see the mail.
The idea of roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be put in place a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, one would need a doctorate in physics, in order to understand them and also very good glasses to read the miniature letters.
The European Commission has requested to reduce roaming tariffs so that they are accessible for the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (interestingly, still has the name Fon when there is does WiFi) reaches this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think otherwise and considering the various offers kterýmiby kompenzovali its data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offers downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contract, no complications.
This device is connected and paid for the purchase, rather than months.
And that's exactly what I expect that one once in případěFonPeek, it is a possibility to purchase with permanent access as the Peak has already established in the US.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I am looking through the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think that it's from the point of view the best type.
It would be interesting if the same system used on the computer.
Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color of the First the Lady.
For Barack Obama for the office of US president chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color can also chosen when it was him on the second most important moment of his life: transmission of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition, fact that this is a similar color - lime with effects efekty-, in both cases it was a the ensemble - clothes, jacket and coat of the same substance - decorated with a large embroidery or collar .
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of Princess asturijské and wear similar clothes.
The substance, which is made of clothes made, both models significantly different different.
On the occasion of taking their Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with printing.
Amend and add: green shoes with medium-high high podpadkem, nynípodobný model, but in a golden colour.
They wear different hairstyles: tentokrátdrdol, before her hair.
75% of working mothers to work problems associated with maternity.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years has increased, especially women in younger which they intend to buy a child.
This is the result of the study fertility and working career of Spanish women which is carried out in cooperation with the Institute of women.
The study attended by 9.737 women aged from 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood.
The study points out that at the beginning of the partner coexistence are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work working part-time or do not have a stable job, start with a partner to live before previously gave birth to their first child and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, the partner coexistence and motherhood delay, and have fewer offspring.
"Women from 35 to 49 years with stable employment have their first child at an average of 3.7 years from the beginning of living with a partner. The number of 4.1 in the case of women, kterédosažení his stable employment to the greater part of his life and therefore have had to postpone the partner coexistence and the arrival of children.
The type of the profession is also a strong influence on maternity, although a smaller influence on the opening of living with a partner, explains Margarita Delgado, which is devoted to research in the CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of anarození child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher is the age when women marry and have their first child.
There are also among the women of the same generation.
