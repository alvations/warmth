An Islamist Mohammed Mursí promised a "new Egypt," when he was formally sworn into office as the first freely elected president of this country, and that after Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed by 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court Mursí became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
Take the oath of office before 18 judges dressed in black robes in the mansion built with a view of the Nile, which resembles an ancient Egyptian temple.
"we are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursí fhat in solemn ceremony live on state television.
Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability," said Mursí, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, the fundamentalist group, which has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Mursí shortly after 11 p.m. local time arrived in a convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police officers guarded the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court building, to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidential pomp period was stopped briefly to the right, to the motorcade through the normally busy road linking the city centre to the suburbs to the south.
Personal prestige Mursího necharismatická derisively known as the "spare tyre" has risen sharply in the Muslim Brotherhood, from his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as the candidate of Islamists, but also all of those who want to lead by the end of the revolt against the authoritarian Mubarak.

Mursí passed on Friday a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, in the place where the revolution was born, which last year put an end to the authoritarian government of Mubarak, and vowed that once again he removed his presidential powers of the office of the military council, which took over from the exiled leader.
But the approval of the composition of the official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is the custom, acquiesced to the will of the army, which suggests that a power struggle will continue.
Mursího speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
Who really wants to get to know a city, it should go to the cemetery.

But statistics show that I am, in terms of Halloween, black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF) will celebrate Halloween this year most Americans - in fact 158 million of them - and will spend a total of $6.9 billion for candy, costumes and decorations.
But every time I look forward to Halloween, for what are the trends.

This year, are the last wheezes fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy may not be only women can be sexy and food like pizza, hamburger and carrots.

According to Google's Most Wanted zombie costumes, Batman, pirates and witches.

In fact, the Americans, according to the NRF, spending this year of $330 million in animal costumes for pets.
So will see a lot of funny psíků.

He managed to find one of the most ingenious drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail.
The US authorities described the tunnel measuring about one metre square one as one of the most ingenious secret passages, which has ever appeared.
The tunnel, which meanders into almost the length of six football fields, combines a warehouse near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the US.

The European elite is ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign (trade for Britain) was started in April with a promise to businesses and define what changes in the relationship with the EU, they want to see the British entrepreneurs and companies that create jobs.
For this purpose we entered the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we are leading British businessmen asked about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov questioned 1,000 business leaders representing British businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on the country to modernize and grow, while EU countries stagnate.
They want to see how the government gives priority to new business ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, than to mired in a long and arduous process of reforming European institutions.
When we asked for their views on specific policy areas - from monopoly laws and regulations on products - most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competences should return to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs, they said, that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trading area - the agreement expressed even 40 percent of large companies, is traditionally the most pro-European of the company.
And, in the end, our survey of businesses showed that most impressive knowledge, and that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a change of the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, with whom to identify companies of various sizes and major business groups, shows that the business sector are pushing for "meaningful change," which brings back influence in Britain.
A lot is at stake - the amendments to the contract and a better deal for Britain may mean profit up 16% of the vote in a referendum on remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: This survey shows that British business supports his plan revised the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects that the amendment would mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back toward Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, given how the eurozone issues on the way for closer economic and fiscal union, and increasingly necessary.
The priority has to be jobs and growth in Britain, and as the results of the survey show, for a business that is the focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.

With enthusiasm, therefore, we are working with the British government to investigate the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland and so bring benefits to all, and to add to the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government as planned.
I look forward to the review of the report on the study along with British ministers during the next year and a common decisions on the next steps.
Frontier Airlines is planning to charge hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 during his years as the imposition of carry-on luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines is planning to introduce a fee of up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for a cup of coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to keep all the can.
The new fee for carry-on luggage is concerned at the top of the storage space, so a small bag under the seat will still be free.
The company says it will charge $25 Frontier, if the fee will be paid in advance, and $100 if passengers will wait until the arrival of payment to the gate.
A spokesman for the company's Frontier Kate O' Malleyová stated that stodolarový fee is to encourage passengers to take care of payment in advance.
"do we pick the charge," she said.
The airlines have begun to charge brought the first and second bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid those fees and poured into carry-on bags hidden in the storage space, as best they could, so often lacking in this space instead.
The fees are one way to learn, to take on board took less things.
The 'Malleyová said that the purpose of this new fee is not actually get more money.
The point is that the company's most loyal customers Frontier is clearly expressed that to find a place in the top of the storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who bought tickets purchased on the company's website, they will not pay.
That is, that one passenger in line at the gate of the company Frontier may bring baggage, for which does not pay anything, while the other passengers in the queue for the same baggage will pay $100.
The 'Malleyová said that Web pages and handling procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers are aware of the fee before their arrival at the gate.
New Frontier's fee for carry-on luggage is not yet in force earlier than in the summer, but the date has not been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline's love.
Claims that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service, they should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see other baggage fee as a sign that the airlines are trying to collect enough money to cover the costs of air traffic after years of losses.
But most of the fees for carry-on luggage did.
The company Spirit Airlines as the first zpoplatnila hand luggage before three years ago and other low-cost Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only company, which also has such charges, is Hungary's Wizz Air, said aviation consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In its report in December 2011 estimated that a fee for carry-on luggage Spirit will bring the company $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former manager of Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit of companies and marveled at what he saw at the gate, when he met with an unusual fee of Spirit's carry-on luggage.
"boarding the smoothest, it was what I had ever seen in his aviation career," he said.
I waited at the gate, I see the gnashing of teeth and quarrels.
The plane was full, he said, "and the onset passed in an instant."
Frontier also makes the charges after the model of Spirit for coffee, tea, soda and juice.
Frontier said that passengers who will get a soda or juice, coffee may retain the can and will be free of charge full.
The water will continue to be given free of charge.
Us Airways tried briefly in 2008 to introduce fees for drinks, but after complaints from passengers about seven months later retreated and no other significant airline nenapodobila her.
The last move of Frontier charge of carry-on luggage, if a passenger nezakoupí years directly from the airline, is the latest attempt to steer customers directly to their Web sites.
The airlines are paying Internet travel sellers, such as Orbitz, from 10 to 25 dollars for each ticket sold.
It could all airlines initiative, to lead passengers to buy directly from them, the place to do it through online travel agencies.
The company Frontier, however, went furthest in this area.
In September she started to give customers who bought over the Internet travel agency, only half miles in the frequent flyer programme.
In the center of the ořízla remuneration for nalétané miles to 25 percent of miles out of the way.
So does the remuneration of the Frontier long journey of 1,000 miles purchased over the Internet travel agency 250 miles.
Customers also allows the company to choose their seat in advance only in the event that the purchase will be carried out directly through the company's Web site Frontier.
The company Frontier has a loyal base of customers in his home town of Denver, but its business is beginning to shrink and is losing money.
According to the financial results referred to in the middle of a corporate partner of the Republic Airways Holdings sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity has shrunk by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter
The Republic is trying to resolve the sale of the airline's financial problems of the company Frontier.
We studied 11 THOUSAND ads!
We know where you want to work!

An example of this may be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, nearly 25 900 ads was published in the same period in 2012 was less than half that.
The posts on the Internet is oriented to closer, in particular, more qualified group of professions.
By contrast, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those working-class, Pavlína Šťastnová introduced the author of the analysis.
The level of representation of the selected professional groups is different in the two media.
The front of the advertisements on the Internet in search of managers and executives, the trade representative, programmers and financial experts.
The position of hackers or small business leaders acted only on the Internet.
The daily newspaper is significantly lower the proportion of these specialist professions, on the other hand, a large representation include in particular service and blue-collar professions.
Education, of course, are among the most commonly reported requirements that employers are expressed through advertising offer.
To further the areas of knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
The daily newspaper on knowledge of a foreign language requirement has been placed in three percent of advertisements on the Internet at 37 percent.
Only two percent of advertisements employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
'computer literacy' claims appeared in 40 percent of the ads in daily newspapers in 11 percent, on the Internet in 57 percent).
The practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The requirements are generally associated with qualified professionals to practice.
The head of the production and other executives.
In the working-class professions is mainly about the mechanics and repairmen or producers and processors of food products or the repair of electrical equipment, said study author George Tillner.
Employers also in the middle of their ads state requirements on the qualities and skills of potential bidders.
Like most skills, communication skills are appearing in advertisements for first place in the long term.
The employers want flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, autonomy, accountability, organisational ability and reliability.
A fifth of shopping centres is struggling with low our attendance
According to data from estate consultancy company Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Prague Bohnicích Krakow Shopping Center opens to the public, will be 19 Prague shopping center.
In the Czech Republic is now a total of 90 major commercial centers.
The disappointing performance concerns about 20 percent of medium and large centers.
The main problems are inappropriately large centre on the site and bad layouty, so too much floors or complicated and chaotic organisation passages, or dead space center," said Michael Sotak of company Cushman & Wakefield.
Also according to the head of the department of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvia Samadi is dealing with our attendance low about a fifth of the trade center.
Among the main reasons include, among other things, poor transport accessibility, low income category of the local population or an overcapacity in the market in a given place.
Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were particularly disappointing at first.
Today the customers are somewhat conservative and don't like to change their shopping habits.
The new trade center must work harder to 'lure' their customers to new brands on the market, entertainment, service and marketing events," Samadi said.
The shopping center occupancy in Sotáka is generally stable, even in some of the centres to increase, because landlords were willing to compromise in the crisis of rent and dopronajmout some units.
But the truth is that recently opened some of the projects, which are not fully occupied and reduce the average occupancy so (Breda & Weinstein, for example in Opava Šantovka in Olomouc)," Sotak said.
The trade center opened in the past two years to promote the market by Sylvia Samadi very slowly.
But there is room in the market for new projects.
The number of seats suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague, we see scope for the construction of the project, which would serve the people of Prague 6.
Certainly there is room in the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called "convinience centres," aimed at daily purchases and services necessary for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
There is also under Sotáka on the domestic market place for other shopping centers.
And as for the little 'service' center, so for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects or expand in regional cities.
"city as Kladno, Czech Republic, Brno or Plzeň Sotak have room for further growth," he added.
In Prague he sees room for the upcoming trade centre in Champion Square, according to him have a clear potential Na Prikope street and Wenceslas Square.
"intensively expansion of retail parks, which allow traders to cover is developing and expanding into smaller and smaller cities for favorable rents and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or shopping centers, and the reconstruction of such as reconstruction of the sietch commercial home Prior, which benefit from good locations," she added Dita Kubánková of company DTZ.
In the Czech Republic is currently located 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross pronajímatelných areas.
A quarter of all these shopping center is located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, stems from the company INCOMA GfK data.
The number of shopping parks in the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared with those of Britain and France is lagging behind the Czech Republic about 50 square meters per thousand people.
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, who died in an accident, believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a rolled-up wrestling duchny in his high school gym, believe that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city Valdosta in Georgia was found on January 11 zakleslý duchně stacked behind the bleachers in the gymnasium of the high school, where he went.
The sheriff's investigators from the District of Lowndes County, made the conclusion that Johnson had died in an accident, but the family of a 17-year-old youth rejects it.
"are clearly believe that their son was murdered," he said to FoxNews.com lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson's.
Never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
"They believe that it defies logic, the laws of physics and common sense," said Crump.
They think that this is to cover it up, what really happened, in order to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual sent his son to school and that they came back in a body bag," he said.
Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that the results of the current investigation of Johnson's death, and said that several key issues remained nezodpovězeno.
What was the cause of death?
His death was the result of a criminal act?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My aim is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for the current investigation," he said.
Moore told journalists that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "asphyxiation of the position."
The second autopsy, however, according to Moore said another cause of death.
There are several questions that must be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that, as in the case of the death of Johnson reveals enough evidence for an investigation of the crime or violation of civil rights, asks the FBI and its implementation.
The sheriff's office in the District Lowndes Thursday was not immediately available for any comment.
The judge of the South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all video from surveillance cameras, which investigators examined.
The parents of a minor hope that the videos will contain a trail leading to the discovery of how their son died.
Report: Obama's campaign considered replacing Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest adviser, according to the New York Times newspaper, secretly considered to replace Hillary Clinton on the ticket of Vice President Joe Biden in 2012.
The revelation is the most important news impatiently expected of the book on the 2012 campaign from Mark Halperina and John Heilemanna "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the book and announced on Thursday evening that the president's top aides held at the end of the year 2011 intensive group meetings and opinion polls to gauge whether the waiver of the Biden, would help revive fading hopes in Obama's re-election.
According to národně-politického correspondent for the Times magazine, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of leading officials in the campaign and in the White House, namely, former director of the office of the White House Bill Daleyho, to measure the effect on the election should tool|Move former Secretary of State Clinton for the post of vice-president.
The potential change was a closely-guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president's closest advisers - including Daleyho, former head of the Obama campaign Jim Messina and former main advisers in the White House of David Axelroda and David Plouffeho - knew that he is considering this change.
The book "double down" claims that Daley was a leader of the effort to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, and that in the meantime, before he finally decided to perform this move as data showed that adding Clinton on a ticket," Obama's chances would be substantially increased."
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the administration was considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I'm intensely examined a whole range of things, and this was one of them," Daley expressed for the sheet.
Don't forget that, at the time, the president had a chance, so we thought: 'Christ, what do we do?"
While Daley described the research as "due diligence," Martin said as a little boy Cooper of CNN, that the campaign for re-election has made considerable investments, to determine whether this move is worth in the elections.
"during the campaign to interpret that kind of money on elections and qualitative research, if something really serious nezvažuje," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew about the fact that his team is considering this exchange.
Martin said on CNN that Daleyho asked whether his former boss knew about this potential shuffling cards.
While Daley said he does not think that the president had been aware of the potential changes'," former office manager admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "double down" finally does not respond to the question of whether the political probe got up to Obama on the table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he really thought that Obama did not know about the research on the register Biden of candidates.
"Maybe," Martin said.
So, no, sir Hašku.
We have a unique opportunity to say to the politicians, not that way.
It is necessary to develop such pressure to Martin Hašek was deprived of all political functions and left mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture, which is already so poor.
Martin zaštíťuje Hašek promise, which gave, but every policy and especially you must be aware of the consequences of the promise and very entertaining, what can promise.
Confidence is the only capital, which has policies (Mr Babiš has the physical, but the question is whether it is policies).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics is no excuse, in politics, was stepping down.
Mr Hašku, if it is good with this country (and your frequent statements encourage me in that, if you just didn't lie - here, you can see how difficult it is to the lies), leave politics alone, like a man.
Then people will accept your apology as the expression of a man who made a mistake and has its responsibility for it.
Otherwise you will be perceived as a spineless wimp, whose words or deeds cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, though erring human life or chicken.
Maybe it seems to you that it is unfair, when oslovuji only you, but you're the leader and they just misguided sheep.
And the leader of you and you've always wanted to be.
I understand that he is now trying to lower the ears, redeploy vysedět shame and then attack again, but so are the guerrillas or podrazáci.
You, I repeat, the leader in their eyes, the alpha male, so they act.
Accept the responsibility and go away from politics.
The black box in your car?
While American road planners struggling to find the money to repair crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box, which is easily fits into the dashboard of your car.
The device, which monitor every mile, who travelled a motorist, and transmit that information to the authorities, are at the heart of the controversial efforts of Washington and offices for the state planning to renovate the outdated system of financing America's main roads.
Generally dull design of motorways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of a variety of associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for it, so that the government could use these small boxes, which would record the distance travelled and perhaps even that, where you're going - and then use this information to build a tax notice.
The tea party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and mentioned a number of problems with the protection of privacy.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states to expect nothing.
During the next decade, they may move to a system in which a driver pays for half a mile of the road, after which he was going.
Thousands of motorists had already black boxes, some of which are using GPS tracking, take to the test.
This is a real need for our nation.
It is not an issue, when we have the power to choose," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Association of State Administration for this state in southern California, which plans to launch the monitoring of vehicle kilometres in each of California motorists in 2025.
Changes to the way we pay these taxes.
Use this technology to do so.
The incentive is the fact that Road trust fund financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.
The Americans don't buy as much gasoline as before.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax of 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen over the past 20 years.
Because of the current high price of gasoline, politicians have also been reluctant to raise the tax on only a single cent.
"gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport policy from the University of Minnesota.
The state recently placed a tracking device to 500 cars, to test the system of paying per kilometre driven.
"It appears to be in the long term as the most logical alternative," he said.
The experts call it a user fee by mileage.
It is no surprise that the urban liberals like this idea, because the tax can be used to change the behavior patterns of drivers, which, for example, can help to reduce traffic congestion and the creation of greenhouse gases.
California's designers look to this system in planning strategies, which are to meet the objectives set out in the ambitious laws on global warming.
But Bill Shuster, a Republican representative from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Committee on Transport, said he also sees this as a long-term alternative nejfunkčnější.
The leaders of the free market of the Reason Foundation are also inclined towards the idea that drivers will pay for the distance travelled.
"It is not a tax, which would disappear into a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president for strategy in the organisation of Reason.
People pay directly for what they receive.
The initiative also support the two former American transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to set off in the direction of paying for half a mile.
The US Senate last year approved a pilot project for $90 million, which should include about 10,000 cars.
The leadership of the House of Representatives, however, rejected the proposal and have done so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the components of the population whose daily life often means travel many miles to work outside the city.
Several states and cities, however, is moving forward on their own.
Most ardent in Oregon, which is the largest experiment in the country include 5,000 drivers.
These drivers will soon start to pay a tax to the state for the distance travelled, instead of the tax on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York's project examines.
Illinois is trying to do this in a limited fashion in trucks.
A coalition of I-95, which includes 17 of the ministries of transport, together with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studies, how can implement this change.
The concept is not just a champion.
In Nevada, where the device was recently about 50 cars equipped with volunteers, drivers were concerned by the fact that the government is able to follow their every move.
"concerns regarding the monitoring of the type of Big Brother and similar issues were a major problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads management strategy and operations on officials of the Ministry of Transport.
It was not something that people wanted.
As the project went on, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada on their website warned: "It would be very easy to turn the device on a full tracking device."
It is not necessary to build a ponderous technological infrastructure, which will inevitably spread to the registration of day trips and the arrival of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find an affordable technology, which would allow the state to keep track of how many miles the car hit, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, said Khan, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology brought some state agencies to small companies in California named True Mileage (real the distance travelled).
The company originally into action to help the government was not involved in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break through in the emerging market with third-party liability insurance, where drivers would be paid on the basis of how much travel.
But this is testing the device, which attracts the attention of the planners of the road network, because only a limited amount of information that does not use GPS and supplies are regularly recorded using a modem.
"People will be more willing to go, if nesledujete their speed and their location," says Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
A number of major errors appeared in some of these pilot programs.
They are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon designers experimented with it, that they give drivers a choice.
They can choose the GPS device with or without GPS.
Or you do not need to take any of the equipment and instead choose to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the people of the state.
In other places they hope to alert the public to the concept initiated, if the device will be able to more, not less.
In the city of New York, transport officials trying to develop the device tax, which would be equipped to pay fees for parking hours, so that it was possible to provide insurance to kilometres travelled and that collected data on the rate of other drivers, so motorists can avoid a traffic jam.
"motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them," states the document projection of the city.
Some traffic engineers would, however, like to know whether any discussion of the payment per kilometre are not just a placeholder problem.
Officials from the Metropolitan Transport Committee in the San Francisco Bay area say that Congress could solve the problem with zbankrotovaným road Trust Fund very simply by an increase in the gasoline tax.
Single or annual tax could be levied on the driver's hybrid or other cars, which many nespotřebují fuel, so they will pay their fair share.
"no radical surgery is needed, when is enough to take an aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee for legislation and public affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will have concerns about privacy and a lot of other things.
With a billionaire will next year on the phone?
Kellner, owner of the PPF Group, wants to buy the mobile operator O2.
The two companies confirmed the talks, according to various sources of agencies, from behind the scenes, says he had a hand in the hole.
The announcement of the transaction should come back in November, probably before the start of the auction spectrum for LTE network, that is, before 11 November.
Karel Komarek Kellnerův competitor KKCG own group.
That is the mark of Sazka Telecommunications dropped to auction spectrum for LTE network.
To everyone's surprise, and that in the meantime the taste of firms to penetrate into telecommunications was not mentioned.
But the Sazka now leads a very experienced telecommunications veteran Robert Chvatal.
He started as a marketing chief of RadioMobil (today T-Mobile), eventually became the director of the Slovak T-Mobilu and last in charge of the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays a few cards at once.
Bid in the auction and now admitted that he wants to run for Vodafone virtuála.
And it makes sense.
If he succeeds in an auction, so the network will be able to move into their existing customers from its virtual operator.
It would be like under normal circumstances like Vodafone, but according to information of Hospodářské noviny that may be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone currently suffer by competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who are completely to share their networks.
Vodafone so he needs a partner.
And that may be just Sazka.
If that succeeds in the tender for the LTE network (as a rookie can spectrum auction specially designed), as Vodafone's auction may not go at all, or he won't mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (frequency is not enough for all).
Vodafone, namely the Sazkou can share the network.
Vodafone drops Sazka into its 2G/3G network (or newly built LTE network to 900 MHz frequency), thus enabling the company a quick start of the network.
Sazka in between starts to build costly LTE network, which will be able to use and Vodafone.
The two companies may be happy with.
The money saved would then Vodafone could spend some solid Internet providers or cable television.
And Kellner?
That would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately won a full operator is still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it's a big juggernaut, which will wait for the restructuring.
In an auction would receive the LTE network Kellner even in the O2 and very likely in conjunction with T-Mobilem.
The two companies already had declared that the network will share.
The auction might finally be a success, but probably not enough with huge sums of money to enjoy the state budget.
And from next year, so customers in the Czech Republic could choose between the call with Vodafone T-Mobilem Kellnerem or Komárkem.
Or the two titans of the Czech business against global giants.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St Petersburg
Environmental activists held in Russia since September to protest against planned production of oil in the Arctic were transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
Informed AFP Agency today with an appeal to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the original charge of its activists of piracy has been withdrawn.
"Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources, that thirty men and women, pent-up in Russia for non-violent action against the oil platform in the Arctic, were transported from the detention centre in Murmansk to the prison in St. Petersburg," the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear, according to DPA agency was concerned about the planned move.
Environmentalists authorities first accused of piracy, which threatened them in the event of a conviction for up to 15 years in prison.
But last week announced that this charge will be replaced by softer výtržnictvím, for which there is less of a sentence with an upper limit of seven years imprisonment.
Greenpeace but in today's statement noted that the charges of piracy, the authorities have tactical and engineering assistance, as promised.
This means that the detention are now charged with two crimes, he said.
The powerful Committee for investigation announced last week that the charge of piracy will replace the charge of hooliganism.
But thirty prisoners appeared before the committee this week, the charge was withdrawn from piracy.
Instead of against any new allegations have been raised," AFP quoted from a statement by Greenpeace.
The Russians had been detained in Gazprom's oil platforms in the middle of September three dozens of members of the Greenpeace movement originating from 18 countries.
Environmentalists were on the ship Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since they are all being held in custody, against which have lodged an appeal, but the court rejected them all.
On the terms of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
Greenpeace executive director Kumi Naidoo, according to AFP, said today that the move to St Petersburg will facilitate meetings between detainees and their families as well as with the consular staff.
There are no guarantees, however, that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"may in fact be worse," he said.
The Dutch king of one of the detained activists Faiza Oulahsenová Willema-Alexandra asked for help.
In hand written letter, which today published newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, monarch invited to talk about their situation in a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The lawyer addicted to cocaine, which warned the mob before police investigations, is in jail
Basharat Ditta (42) had to pass on the information to the king of the underworld Neil Scarbroughovi.
A lawyer, he feared that his drug addiction comes out.
Liverpoolský crown court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer, who informed the drugs Mafia on a large scale of the police investigation, because he feared that his drug addiction comes out, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta (42) had after he was suspected of cocaine use, the underworld boss Neil Scarbroughovi transmit sensitive information about the investigation into his activities related to drug trafficking.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) criminals and which has been hailed as the best legal representative, after police monitoring Scarborougha, which in earlier proceedings involving narcotics represent, arrested at his home in 2011.
Police officers saw Sarborougha (32), as he left in a house in Lancashire Blackburnu právníkově, who was having dinner with colleagues from the Law Society, three bags of cocaine.
On the basis of the tests, in which they found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
Over a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, trying to get information about the arrest of two men in favour of Scarborougha archly and his companion.
All four suspects were being monitored at the time as part of an investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Cumbria, Lancashire, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police arrested during a series of hauls of heroin and cocaine worth about £1.5 million in cash, along with £200,000 in prison together with them over the next 32 people.
Ditta (42) passing on information to the criminals out of fear that they would come to his addiction to cocaine.
Today, Forbes Solicitors Ditta, who works for a company based in Blackburnu experienced before the crown court liverpoolským shameful moment, when he was found guilty of that, after a three-week trial that defense of the administration of justice in two cases.
During an earlier hearing he admitted to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after Scarborougha police investigation found that he was in February 2011 in regular phone contact with Dittou.
Two detectives suspect tracked, recorded his arrival to Dittova house and saw him placed the drugs about 60 percent below the lawyer's pure trash in the black golf glove.
He was subsequently Scarborough Dittou, who was at the dinner at the football stadium with Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park, in a telephone interview.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there have been nine of talks between the two parties.
In court, said that he found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards and that Ditta was "a regular user of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, and said that he spoke with the suspected dealer, therefore, that was his client, and argued that their conversation is in "confidential communications."
During his arrest Ditta took his wallet and tried to get a few of her credit cards, but all were detained and were his hair samples.
During police questioning, he said that his office at his home address in the workplace, and that clients because of labor affairs visited him at home as well.
But the court heard that after the key arrests contacted a significant player in the drug supply chain, some of which had been represented, to tell them what they know of them detectives.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "Who else is more than aware that must not violate the law, the legal representative in the area of criminal law."
Mr Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a lawyer and that he was in close contact with a client too.
The relationship, that we're talking about here is not just about a drug pusher, but into a drug dealer who supplied his own lawyer drugs.
Undoubtedly, some of his talks were legitimate, because his lawyer was.
But it has gone far beyond the boundaries of the current relationship právník-klient.
The police investigation undoing, as best he could, to allow them to continue in their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta brought the reputation of their profession, on the other hand, the disgraced it.
With some of his clients are too close, particularly the Scarboroughem, and allowed to be undermined its independence.
Ditta refused the wrongdoing and said: "I was corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I would like to give Mr Scarboroughovi information, I didn't expect 15 hours, but I'd do it immediately."
After the hearing, however, the police inspector Lee Halstead from Lancashire said: "Mr Ditta from a lawyer in the criminal field alone has become a criminal when he began to obtain drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leaders of organized crime groups, which gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and to inspire confidence in public, and feel that they can count on them.
Mr Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the guise of their profession.
The unit for serious and organised crime in Lancashire ran against Mr Dittovi investigations, on the basis of which was also sentenced to three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals before the court.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals, that no one is beyond the reach of the hand of the law.
We will find you and put before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was declared guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty five people involved in trading, a total of 153 years have been imprisoned for drug offenses.
On its Web site Ditta about organised online conversation, in which he said that his dream job would be legally represented clients from the block of the duties of death in America, as a guest at the dinner would wish Mohammed Ali and as an incentive for the work of the disenfranchisement.
Obama is backing away from health care
After a wave of criticism of President Obama yesterday backed away from his often repeated and ambitious promise, that "if you like your health program, you can keep it."
With reference to the hundreds of thousands of notification of testimonies from providers Republicans in recent days accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama flinched from its original promise.
"the vast majority of people who have a functioning health insurance, you can keep it," he said in his speech in Boston.
With regard to what he called the "rumors in the media," the testimonies, Obama called on Americans who received the notification to the search for new policies on the market.
The majority of the people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even less than expected.
You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population, which buy insurance for itself, may be forced to change the program, because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Act on the care available.
"I say that these Americans on the plane: You deserve something better," Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Commerce in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Law on the care available, she said, that the launch of the online market was "miserable" from October.
"I am disappointed and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your confidence back.
Irritated Sebelius this sentence, which caught on microphone, said yesterday in the direction of advisors seated behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which was held after a stormy exchange of views with Republikánem Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, which was the subject of whether she herself has involved in the Obama care program.
More than three hours during a hearing on Sebeliusovou repeatedly pressed the question, why the "architect" of the care available voluntarily gave up on a government sponsored insurance, and nezakoupil program through HealthCare.gov, which now is forcing millions of Americans.
Travel through the mud, the river and the jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care to the villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treated almost every weekend hundreds of patients
In the countries of West Africa is not too many doctors; only one in 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via their mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major candidates on the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
In the competition for the price of the CNN Heroes of 2013, you can vote for him or for any of the 10 major candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000, so that he could continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father has deteriorated again and again into unconsciousness and go to hospitals, which were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash near the capital city of Yaounde, Cameroon, in 1981.
First he treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that has spread to the brain, and there a hematoma, which caused him problems throughout his life.
"in Cameroon were no neurosurgeons," says Georges Bwelle.
We had to take him out of Cameroon, if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years by his father ferried into the crowded clinics and hospitals, where he had received such treatment, which was just available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can get out of the house at five in the morning rush to the hospital, you were there first, but not the first.
There are many patients.
Some people die just because you have to wait.
Since 2002, when Bwelleho father died, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organisation in Cameroon is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Just for comparison, the ratio is one doctor at 413 people in the United States.
And even if the doctor could visit the Cameroonians, many could not afford it.
Two of the five people in this country are living below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the expenditure on health care in this country are private.
"The only problem is poverty, which they have," says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, she cannot take her life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers conducted last year for free 700 operations.
He became a doctor cardiovascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaounde.
And he founded the non-profit organisation ASCOVIME, whose members at the weekend visit rural areas, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, his group of volunteers helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people napěchuje supply to be attached to the roof of medical supplies and travel rough terrain to the villages, which are in need of help.
It is not always accompanied by luck.
More than once, the vehicle must push through the water and mud.
But when they arrive, they will welcome as the real heroes: The feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation, which a community can offer.
In the villages of free medical care is really the reason to celebrate and Bwelle - with his broad smile and unbridled energy - are very willing to engage local merriment.
The next day the team starts to treat hundreds of patients.
"on every trip we have 500 patients," says Bwelle.
Come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends doctors provide different medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, and diseases parazitními sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get the crutches or donated glasses or birth certificate for free - the document, which calls for the school, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening the team is under local anaesthetics a simple operation.
The operation is usually do in the school building in the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes into zotavovacího points, to relax for the next patient.
By means of light from a generator, the operating room and sanitary equipment Bwelle and his volunteers work in the early morning hours.
It's exhausting, but village musicians usually the team's help, to maintain his motivation.
"us to stay up all night and continued their work, play the drums," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of his work.
The group - consisting of Cameroon's doctors and foreign medical students - 700 operations carried out last year, free of charge, and he is aware that their aid may mean a lot for the local people.
One man said that after a hernia operation will be able to work again.
"It will change the future of our family," said the man.
In addition to organizing the following weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at the hospital Bwelle also works in the night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that this second work finances about 60% of its unprofitable activities; the rest cover private contributions.
"I'm not sure when, in fact, sleeping," says Katie O' Malleyová, who is studying medicine at Drexelově University in Philadelphia and is working as a volunteer for the second year Bwelleovu group.
It is always either in the hospital or trying to get money for the organization, that the campaign could do.
For students of medicine and nursing services, such as O' Malleyová, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelleovi on his mission, it's a great experience, which would gain at home.
"Dr. Bwellemu umývali hands thoroughly and remove stains or we kept his instrument," says O' Malleyová.
As a medical student in his second year in America that never experience.
Students volunteers usually pays its way into Cameroon alone and often arrive with darovanými medical needs.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaounde, food, transport and education gives them Bwelle.
"No doubt it is a hero," says O'Grady Malleyová.
The organization gives his life and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelleho constant will not be a burden.
To help others to live happier, fulfilling a promise he had made to his father, is something he brings great joy.
"I'm so happy when I'm doing this job," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope I can see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain - that is the reason why I'm doing it.

Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank, the ECB, the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan to become a permanent tool, which allows banks access to global currencies, whenever they need.
The banks said in their joint statement.
"It's a very good step," said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.

The EU has agreed to the banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus over a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of people infected is growing each year.
In 2002, for example, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year it was infected with 212 and it was a record number.
"about it, there is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases exceeds 200 this year, according to me," said Miroslav Hlavaty, an expert on the issue of AIDS, who for years led the Prague House lights for patients.
According to him last year from January to September has grown in the country of 165 patients with HIV, this year over the same period there have been 176.
Since the beginning of the monitoring by the end of September tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and women's 353, with the most infected was in Prague.
The number reached in September 2005.
In the County resident 206 infected.
The diagnosis was vyslechlo and 156 people of South Moravia, 130 of the Moravian-Silesian or 116 of Ústeckého.
At least infected comes from the Highlands, 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of the patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people were infected by a transfusion of blood in the past.
Such a case, but since the beginning of the testing, therefore, for more than a quarter of a century, appeared in the Czech Republic.
With six children, he also was born with the HIV virus from mother to them.
Children should be taught the myths and legends like "models for a way of life," says the author.
The stories of Thórovi can show that "brute force can be clever trickery," while the Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of myths," for teaching at the school was too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene," said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works of the appropriate age.
"I think that's great, that the creation myths and folk are already part of education," he said.
I defended the plan after 20 years.
He added that "openly educational" writers and teachers are in engaging story with "podprahovým" message for children as "the switch."
Crossley-Holland, which translated from anglosaštiny epic Beowulf, who also writes the myth of Norway (Penguin Book) and British national stories, he says, "you may have good intentions, but are you going to do better, if you let them for you."
Perhaps the biggest difference between adult author píšícím for adults and the adults author píšícím for the children need a sense of hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or end happyendem, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And that must be unconscious; revealed through the story, not openly stated.
The old truth about it, that it is better to show than describe.
Miloslav Cejpková: November's smile
Came from outside of 4 degrees Celsius, what're not used to them yet.

With the increasing poverty of the middle class are experiencing a pawnshop in Singapore to flourish
In a pawn shop in a shopping cent Bendemeer stopping in Singapore Janani Amirthalingaová gold bracelet, ring and earrings, in order to be able to pay for his daughter's tuition fees.
"We just bought a house with her husband and I put all my money on it," says Ms Amirthalingaová.
Although each month as CEO gets $2400 (3000 SGD) and her husband also works, a family's monthly income is insufficient, he says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia - where the increased household debt - is indeed that of ValueMax society, where a woman is carrying out their operation, this week became the third pawnshop on the stock market in Singapore on the list.
The jewelry is not just a quick way to borrow cash - 1300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalingaové -, but is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The pawn shop in Singapore normally apply the annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the rate offered by the bank 15,4procentní United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping center.
The pawnshop, however, have the advantage that do not require verification of the person (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And because of that, as families are feeling the pressure because of rising living costs and growing household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to the pawnshops.
After five years of growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit, supported by a loose monetary policy in advanced economies, with low and moderate income families turn to pawn shops, to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in the home mainly due to rising nájmům as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have in household debt to gross domestic product, the highest in Asia.
Malaysia is at the head of the list with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, which is an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which is only just received this week from a technical recession.
Data on Thursday showed continued weak exports and a decline in consumer demand.
The point is that the increasing costs of the people from high to low income range [] will try to supplement their income, wherever they can," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people quickly stop their personal property and use the opportunity to redeem for cash their family jewels.
About 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 zastavárnách form the gold.
People say: The price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and we'll get him back next month.
The largest operator of pawn shops in Thailand, EasyMoney, noted in recent months to an increase in the number of customers using its 20procentní pawn shops.
The growth in the sector is so large that ValueMax zastavárenském, the operator of the branch in downtown Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four branches, but also outside Asia, says executive director of ValueMax Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will finance the package that 60 percent of the 66 million SGD, which has taken this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount creditors came under fire of criticism because of high interest, Mrs. Yeah says arrest offers not only lower rates than other creditors, but also directly that does not increase the debt.
"customers stop objects, which already owns, and the realisation of personal assets does not increase the debt of the household," he says.
In the company's pledge of more and more accepted as a means to ensure the short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use the pawnshop, moreover, are not only the people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use branches of ValueMax, when stop gold bars or a Rolex watch, and they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all possible circumstances.
These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of his courageous business or investment, or small businesses that need help to settle problems in their cash flow," says Ms Yeahová.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.

Coulson hacked into the phone to check a tip
The former editor of the News of the World newspaper (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used methods" to hack into the phone, monitoring and confrontation," he said fraudulent tip on a love relationship in which should be involved then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew EDIS said that the News of the World newspaper picked up at the Old Bailey court in May 2005 false reports that Clarke was seen with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlbyovou.
Newspapers have attributed the private investigator Glenn Mulcairea to hack into the voicemail Pawlbyové and penetrated her privacy, but the court said that Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
State prosecutor suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now editor of NotW is not a man who stands in front of the house, and he hopes that people will catch on the outside, but a man who loved the people want stories, to see what they say," Mr EDIS said.
The newspaper said that the examination of the stories used three ways: Nabourávání NotW is on the phone, tracking and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the other, monitoring, must know about it.
And what about the first?
He knows about nabourávání is on the phone?
He says no, we say: "Oh, yes, he knows that."
Rumors of a love affair, in which Clarke is involved, they were first captured the NotW newspapers, as the source for the story, which was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlbyovou, was told: "You're wasting your time, that is with Charles."
Counting the record with vocal messages from her phone on at least three occasions, was acquired in Mulcairově house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the computer of a private investigator, where Mrs. Pawlbyová and her sister were referred to as "Projects."
During the period when it was investigating Mrs. Pawlbyová, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls, in which they were asked for information about Pawlbyové, Mr EDIS said.
Meanwhile, the former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watchdog to monitor the movement of Mrs Pawlbyové.
Coulson her 18 June 2005 left a voice message, in which he told her: "I've got a story that we are going to go tomorrow and on which I would very much like to talk with Charles."
Mr EDIS says Coulsona involvement in the story was the same model as for other important personalities, including former Interior Minister David BLUNKETT.
In court on Thursday said that Coulson confronted Mr Blunketta for romance with a married woman, while he himself saw the spoluobžalovanou Rebecca Brooksovou, which at the time was married.
Brooks and Coulson deny conspiracy with other persons to hack into the phones in the period between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to hack into the phone.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where America was born solo comic performances: Almost a century ago variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies in the theater of the Palace Theatre on Broadway, the assembled people began telling jokes method of the interview.
Fayova innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival founded and directed by Caroline Hirschovou, founder of the institution Carolines comedy celebrates its 10th anniversary this year - along with more than 60 solo shows in small clubs, large theaters.
"Most of these titles appeared at Carolines and became successful to the extent that they are too big to be played at the club," said Hirsch.
The festival was created as a way to continue to work with them.
This year's event includes appearances Wanda Sykesové, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes" (stand up for heroes), an annual musical comedy play a benefit performance at Madison Square Garden, on which among other withdraws Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
As well as the spread of this festival, extended the world of comedy.
A number of comedians participating in this year's festival came from non-traditional channels, such as television or radio show in smaller companies, such as FX, Comedy Central and Spike.
Nick Kroll climbed to his sitkomem (cheerfully piquant "League" to the topic on FXX fantasticko-fotbalové) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slateová was a member of both the programme of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and restaurant," but the most famous burgeoning of the series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on "(urinal Marcel in boots).
As Kroll, so Slateová, as well as other young comedians with clearly identifiable voices (surreálně pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, scathing, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest taháků festival will interview: David Steinberg will speak with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but he became a successful television and film director, as well as the unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007 held at the station TV Land show entitled "Sit down broken with David Steinberg."
The meeting is being held at Town Hall in midtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy of the DNA of Larry's work as a whole," said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes walks down the aisle between two buildings, and he says: Man, if I come on all the money, maybe I'll live here.
Many things moved, and is otherwise.
Maybe the commentator Pečinka spoke so that they could agree, while President Štěch fanning discord.
General Chovanec me was the suspect as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and is a symbol of the misery ČSSD continue.
Other guys have their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is consistent and readable and useless, Vice-President Zaorálek has prevented most interview on television.
On the basis of that, I don't see a better option than to ČSSD proposed for the PM deputy Senate Gajdůškovou, the only one would have an initial handicap and I think I would have done the standard of performance.
This is as good a solution that will support him as someone from the leadership.
I might add that this solution is the only way to forget what was done, and the parties continue without rupturing.
Alena Gajdůšková would be able to form a minority government with just a blessing from the Chairman of Babiše without fear and without people, but with lidoveckým Hovorkou health minister, who is, in fact, the faithful of a social democrat.
This minimenšinová government should great stability, because it would enforce the law on the referendum and that is committed to support as well as the chairman of the Dawn Okamura.
President Babiš would eventually accepted, with tax progression, because he is smart and he sees that it can't go without it.
PP would nepřinášeli problems, because Hovorka holder is the best of what they have, and the government would have been otherwise.
The same is true of YES, even here the valuable minister could be found, but when reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, as well as well.
Add the courage Alyona Gajdůškové!
The detention of Barty is connected with Janouškem and Bémem: Behind the leaking of wiretaps?
President Things public Vitus Bártu on Thursday arrested by the police.
Along with him was also detained head of analysts and Informatics anti-corruption police Jan Petržílek.
The detention is linked to wiretapping Romana Janoušek lobbyists and former Mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the eavesdropping, had come up with the server novinky.cz, the Czech press office confirmed a credible source.
Janoušek odposlechnuté telephone calls and Prague, the Mlada fronta Dnes newspaper published in March of last year, in which both men call each other "Minion" and "Kolibříku," show Janouškův influence on the steps of the city under Bémovým leadership.
The Journal said at the time that he was in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), of which about two years later escaped to the safety agency ABL.
Here then owned Bárta.
The server novinky.cz pointed out that the detainee, the criminalist Petržílek worked before their entry to the anti-corruption police just for the BIS.
The Anti-Corruption Unit, who then deal with wiretapping Petržílek crossed at the same time, when they were published.
"I can't confirm anything with regard to the law on the protection of classified information or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michael Muravský Municipal from the public prosecutor's office in Prague.
It also refused to confirm, that case polices.
The case does not wish to comment or inspections for the same reason.
The anti-corruption police officer arrested with Vítem Bárta
Bart's attorney Oldřich Chudoba, to represent him in the case of alleged corruption of MPs VV, too much of the case also didn't want to comment, but said: "Yes, I represent a client in this case as well, but I can't comment that due to the protection of classified information."
According to the information rights case deals with the inspection of security forces (GIBS).
The server Europe said that Bart could buy secret information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz could be the case with former police kauzou president Peter Lessyho, on whose appointment Bárta allegedly sought.
Information Rights but show that the detention of Vitus Barty has nothing to do with Peter Lessym.
A police spokesman declined to comment on the matter by the Presidium of Eva Kropáčová with it, that the case is dealt with in the Prague city prosecutors.
"This question will be no comment with regard to the protection of classified information," she said on Friday, spokesman for the public prosecutor's office in Prague Municipal Právo Štěpánka Zenklová.
The plaintiff Bártovu case polices, and in her words thus indirectly shows that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in secret.
Reporter Novinek Vitus Barty managed to reach his wife Catherine Klasnovou this morning from their residence in Prague KLÁROVĚ.
Just loading bags into the car and left.
For the whole of the event, declined to comment.
In a Friday morning to Bártovu detention expressed a movement leader Dawn Tomio Okamura.
That, according to his words, has no idea of what is involved in the case.
"Vit Barta was one of many, many party candidates on the ballot, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, there is not even a member of the Dawn Tomia Okamury direct democracy," he added.

Concerns about the safety of Mozambique's escalating due to a conflict of strong personalities
Under a statue of Samory Machely, founder, with thousands of people gathered in downtown Maputo, Mozambique President to a rare public demonstration cheered peace slogans.
"we want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Out of fear for the future of their country changed corporate dress over a T-shirt adorned with the words "demand safety" in Portuguese and joined in on Thursday to the crowd at Independence Square in the capital city.
After two weeks ago came almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo party on one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once notorious rebel movements, originally supported under white rule in Rhodesia and then the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilise independent of the government of this country.
After the peace agreement in 1992 to become an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely to open conflict broke out in the country again, but recent events startled foreign investors and local.
At stake is a rapidly growing economy, since the discovery of large offshore reserves of oil and coal deposits in the northwest over the next few years may bring on the part of companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale of Brazil, Italy's Eni and Anadarko, US investment in the value of more than $50 billion.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo accuse each other of generated tension.
The party Renamo claims that the government forced the last conflict by 17 September launched an attack on their members in Sofala province, a traditional stronghold of the Party of Renamo.
Violent assaults on the former rebels subsequently peaked, when government forces attacked the base of the party Renamo and attempted to kill AFONSA Dhlakamu, the leader of the group, told the Financial Times the Renamo spokesman Fernando Mazanga.
The government blames for triggering the conflict Renamo, because, he said, swatting at the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to assuage fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza for the French press office told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as "a loser," that he would use "whatever is left of his forces to try to prove that the government can make their own decisions."
Both Frelimo and Renamo claims that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have increased, as have been cited the words of Mr Mazangy that Renamo party withdraws from the peace agreement of 1992.
The FT said, that meant that the party, Frelimo already agreement preserves.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done to alleviate the tension between these parties, caused by a series of skirmishes in this year, only a few.
It's a skirmish between two large personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said the Lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique Joseph Hanlon.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo party, to seek election changes, has already expressed that would have boycotted municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort to get the dying movement from the government benefits and financial returns.
The share of the election of the party Renamo has decreased since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (investments), which was based on a former member of the Renamo, expected to improve their position in the election.
Mr Mazanga said that Mr Guebuza - which a second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"more than one party does not want a democratic system, does not want to be transparent elections, doesn't want peace, because he doesn't want to let go of the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but carried out subversive terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between the north and the south.
Most skirmishes occurred in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred miles away from the capital Maputo, but where is the city Beira port, which rely on mining companies, including companies Rio Tinto and Vale, in its coal exports.
In June the company Rio has suspended the use of the railways for about a week, when the party Renamo threatened that on this line of attack.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo repeats his threat.
Renamo wanted "to warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop, and many people also has concerns about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnapping.
"People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is to be borne exclusively by the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems," he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultuane says, that people just want stability.
"Nobody cares Renamo, Frelimo, or people just want peace, they want to have free access to the side of the road," he says.
Tripodi denies that it would affect Obeid
Former Labour minister will be investigated by a committee of the State of New South Wales (Australia) surveillance on corruption.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi denied, that would change the policy of the coastal lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeida, which he had hidden interests in three properties on land controlled by the Government.
An independent committee against corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation of whether Mr Obeid lobbied for a number of government ministers, that he was hiring at Circular Quay, where Obeidovi owned two restaurants and cafe, be renewed after its expiration in August 2005 without it, he would have had to take part in the competition.
The committee is now investigating claims that Mr Tripodi knew of secret interests of Mr Obeida on these properties, and that on the basis of the evidence presented on Thursday, the former deputy head of the office of Mr Tripodiho Lynne Ashpoleovou.
During the years of talks initiated in 2005, the government pushed for it to go into rentals public competitions.
Tenants were against it and also wanted a longer-term contract conditions.
In 2009 were renting for businesses in the Circular Quay, which restored Obeidovým brought $2.5 million a year, without the need to take part in the competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was the minister of ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeida, who, like Mr. Tripodi said, insisted on a shift in the government's rental policy.
The transcript showed calls initiated in the ICAC calls from August to September 2007 between masters and Obeidem Tripodim and Steve Dunn, the head of the court, which the department came after he had worked under Mr. Obeidem ports in the Department of Fisheries.
"He was the subject of talks during these phone calls the development of commercial leases policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy Mr Tripodiho.
"No," Mr. Tripodi said.
I can't remember what we talked about, but not on this one.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeidem.

In what health is?
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry in it are not added
More than a thousand tonnes of fermented cabbage want to make in the next few months in Slovácko Frutě Kunovice, which belongs to a food group Hamé.
This season began in October and will take about half a year.
A healthy delicacy here since 1925 still produces the traditional way, so much directly in large tanks.
In a modern industrial age, it is a curiosity.
Our shift worker našlapou for almost a ten-kilometer route.
In each of the ten tanks hold 15 to 30 tonnes of cabbage, filling one lasts three shifts," said race director David Kladroba Slovácká Fruta.
Cabbage drives to the site of the company and of Břeclav Ostrožska directly from farmers from their fields.
Staff Fruty VOY|Endgame vegetables cleaned, the stalks and throw into krouhačky.
From here already sliced cabbage falls into pools of proclaiming the depth at which they work tirelessly šlapačky clad in white clothing and boots.
The squeeze out the side air.
Last sešlapaná layer cabbage is superimposed on the canvas and will weigh on the water.
"cabbage shreds, then aged six to eight weeks for spontaneous fermentation milk without any addition of supporting the fermentation process," the director stressed Kladroba.
A natural process to produce in the domestic conditions, individual layers of salt and caraway prosypávají workers.
The cabbage after fermentation goes to the line.
Packed in brine sladkokyselém into bags or glass jars and undergoing sterilization.
Hamé adds sauerkraut, above all, to the Czech and Slovak market.

UEFA Damkové said prohibits disclosing penalties for arbitration.
Dagmar Damková, chairman of the board of the Football Association arbitration of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing punishments for the referee.
UEFA rules prohibit it, which said in an interview for the law journal.
Otherwise, they threatened to FAČR attack.
Damková also denied that in his position would have shunned the footballers of Pilsen, where it came from.
Such speculation is really absurd.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but other members of the committee are from elsewhere, for example, as well as from Prague.
So in the case of the vote I can lose 1: 6," said Damková in response to the criticism, which was exacerbated after Plzeň recently trifle penalt twice as much than other league teams.
Although, in recent months, stopped FAČR public punishments for arbitration, Damková assures that the referee for his mistakes suffer.
"Believe me, that if the commission finds that the referee made a mistake, reducing his delegation, whether it was in any of the games," said Damková.
The reason why the sanctions are not published, is under Damkové ban from the European football Union.
"UEFA bans publication of such information and violations severely punished."
"We are very suspicious and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We publish, but I've got two very strong warning that if we come with that tough sanctions," said Damková.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
Should the continued publication of information, said the commission could lose money from UEFA on education and the development of arbitration.
"You are very important for us."
"Without them we can't meet arbitration education program," she added Damková.
The Internet means the end of the travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems successfully bucking the trend.
The company has updated estimate of the annual profit and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and Great Britain.
The travel agency now expects its annual underlying pre-tax profit will range between $340 million and 325 compared to 305 to $315 million from the previous forecast.

The British police delivered Assange extradition notice
The British police today delivered a notice on the issue of the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said that 40letému Australanovi delivered "the issue" with the fact that asks him to appear at the police station and that if he fails to do so, he may be at risk of arrest.
Assange under British law has exhausted his options, when the Supreme Court this month set aside his appeal against extradition, and is facing extradition to Sweden over accusations of sexual crimes.
Stockholm because he feared that it would be issued to the US, sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where this South American country has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard" 40letému men served notice on the issue, which is to appear at the police station in the day and time, he has been identified," the spokesman said.
Assange remains in breach of bail conditions.
The embassy refused to serve notice on the issue of the comment.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he could face charges of espionage because the website WikiLeaks released 250,000 US diplomatic documents.
The Supreme Court ruled: Weather can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Nečas may also be prosecuted for any crimes, which could happen before August by dissolving the House of Deputies.
Procedural immunity, which protects him only applies to the speeches in the House.
In the case of former Members of the ODS Ivana fuksy, Mark Šnajdra and Peter Tluchoře, by contrast, has decided that it cannot be punished for possible criminal offences until last November gave up the exercise of the parliamentary mandate, said Supreme Court spokesman Peter Knötig.
The court rejected this Decision Iva Ištvana, the public prosecutor's request that he wanted to continue in the criminal proceedings with Members.
You have taken a bribe in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned firms to renounce the mandate and will not make trouble for approving laws.
Conversely can continue to prosecute a former prime minister, who offered them these posts.
Aircraft makers argue about the width of the seats at stake are large contracts
Among the leading manufacturers of aircraft was unveiled a dispute about the width of the seats in the second grade for flights over long distances, which this month gave the cause of the bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is granted the width of seats on long-haul flights for economy class - not just the one would usually preceded the airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to claims on efficiency at the last aircraft offered by Boeing and Airbus SAS.
The company Airbus this week called for industry standards, which would have offered at least 46 cm wide seats in economy class, but the main American rival Boeing says airlines should decide about it.
The dispute arose at a time when the aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of the largest version of its two-engined long-range aircraft with the potential of a record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
So, how is the rear part of the plane disintegrated - especially if it is next to each other - 9 or 10 seats, is the basis of economic performance of "mini-jumbo" proposals for new aircraft.
The company Boeing 777X says that the improved model," "delivers 406 people in economic a breadth of more than 43 cm spread after 10 seats in each row.
The company Airbus says competing versions of the A350 model delivers 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread after 9.
The giant aircraft are often attack each other in the technical issues through ads in the professional media.
Airbus now before the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders, appeals directly to the public.
Recently provisionally showed what may be the start of a new advertising war, when financiers showed a picture showing three people in the restaurant with the headline "They would you like it?"
"Boeing promotes long-distance flights in the seats closer than they are in regional turbo-prop aircraft," said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
As the amended návky, people are eating more, but the seats on planes have radically changed.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-distance air transport, by the turn of the century, according to data from the Ministry of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 years, the US has increased by 10 percent.
According to the American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century over 100 cm.
Airbus contends that his rival is holding the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average width of the seats of new pokřtěného aircraft was lower.
The company Airbus claims that carried out the research, which suggests that the extension of the seat of 2.5 cm will improve the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects the dimensions of the seats of the Airbus company and says that it is not in the powers of the aircraft manufacturers to decide on how airlines exports fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that experience in the cabin depend on more than just the width of the seat.
"really going for it, to provide the flexibility to airlines and allow them to carry out the things they are convinced that they have to do to be successful," said an expert on the cab area of Kent Craver.
They don't want to dictate to them what brings them a profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More space for passengers is essential for his elbows, but for the vendor is a growing problem, which can affect yields.
For this dispute is the race with an estimated trade in the coming decades in aircraft orders worth at least $700 billion at catalogue prices, enough to tip the balance of the American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the distribution of seats is what drives the battle between the last aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claims that are in their most recent proposals twin-engine long-haul aircraft about 20 percent better performance than the market leader in this segment, a model of the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats.
The performance claims Boeing 777X model design depends in part on a comparison with 10 seats in the series and the concept of the 777 with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in the unit costs compared with 10sedadlovému concept is weakened.
"why that Boeing is doing, is home to more seats, and made its aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Airbus chief for the convenience of passengers in the company for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say, that the cabin with 10 seats in a row for the existing 777 models are in accordance with the fact that many of the passengers is for thicker layout, which can go hand in hand with lower fees.
"Forty five inches wide seat for passengers would have been great, but the reality is that, from a business point of view, Airbus is motivated by the threat of the 777 model," said Mary Kirby, an expert on the interior of the cabin, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network portal.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seat, but the airlines are offering a catalog of suppliers, to be able to choose.
Scestovalí aircraft sellers even carry measurement of the zone to check the competitive arrangement.
While wearing comfort, all producers also offers an aircraft with highly dense arrangements for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus is offering the A350 model with 10 seats in the series, but says it still sold.
Until recently offered for some of its aircraft, Airbus emphasized the need for greater regulation of the cabin that wider seats in the aisles.
Experts say that without the support of only one other producer of large modern aircraft call for new industry standards they will remain, but may deter them from the waves of the sale of the 777X.
CME focus on the TV business.
The release of nearly a quarter of the people.
The media group CME will leak.
By the end of the year he wants zeštíhlet for thousands of people.
Cut to the side of the business and wants to focus only on their main business, a television broadcast.
The group, which owns the TV Nova in the Czech Republic and Slovakia also operates in Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
The work that comes almost a quarter of the people.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
The company is part of CME CET 21, which holds the license for broadcast television station Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, shopping, the TV and the Czech version of MTV music station.
How much they touch the economies of the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what it will mean for the national television one TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It is premature and we can't really comment on that," said the director of communications New Phonetic|Juliet Koukolíček.
According to the information she cannot avoid significant layoffs of the Czech Republic will of MF DNES, but by far the greatest impact that would have on staffing levels of branches of CME in Romania and other countries.
The two new bosses New Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who climbed after lengthy director Adrian Sarbuovi during Wednesday's conference call with analysts have talked about it, that they want to limit all activities that are not directly linked to the television business.
So it is quite likely that significantly reduces the cost of producing its own shows in particular, film and production activities.
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of the defunct company Nortel patents, filed suit on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including the company's Google, the company that přelicitovala at auction in the framework of the bankruptcy of a company Nortel.
A consortium Rockstar, which purchased the company Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, zažalovalo in US District Court in Texas Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.
The company Rockstar is in joint ownership of companies, Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Nokia and Sony.
Google is accused of breach of the seven patents.
The patents include technology, which helps Doctor|Cold search terms on the Internet with the relevant advertising, states that the action, which is the core search business to Google.
Samsung, HTC, Huawei and Rockstar representatives were not immediately available.
Samsung, HTC and Huawei produce phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which competes with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011 Google made the default price offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated in the battle for the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google earned $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, which trade was motivated in part by a group of Motorola's patents.
"despite the failure in an effort to get the patents in the auction, which are the subject of the dispute, Google infringed patents and continue to be violated," stated in the petition.
The company Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google, because according to her is a patent infringement of the Google deliberately, as saying the action.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots on the selection
Another day, another ghost story on independence.
This time appears warning that an independent Scotland is a condition for membership in the EU would be his entry into the Schengen area.
It gave the cause to the stories of passport checks in Berwick and a barbed wire fence along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the newspaper Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but, as might be expected, it did not translate into newspaper headlines.
They also mentioned that the EU Member States spends much time by adapting their own laws, if it suits them.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the continued non-compliance would be cheap for Brussels concession in return for anything from Scots really want.
So it's pretty weak story.
And, in addition, so old that it has become a fossil. The canard that "independence means passport control," I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet the bearded in this story is an interesting idea.
Why shouldn't be expected, that an independent Scotland will listen to Europe?
Why change London's yoke for the Brussels, particularly now?
This is a real European story: The great postwar plan to unite Europe finally collapsed.
The influence of the crisis of the euro is the so-called Project Europe officially dead.
Across Europe, the influence of the party of opposition to the EU or the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, Eurosceptic party, Alternative for Germany - based in this year - came out of nowhere and they capture nearly five million votes in September's federal election, which essentially "sweep" the Free Democrats in the Bundestag (equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats).
On home soil was always the opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, has become a decisive moment.
Austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, along with the jacket navléknutou on the national economy by adhering to the common currency project have led many people to think that Europe had gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that the national government is running a high budget deficit - that was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro, which blocks their members to exchange rates favorable for German exporters - and German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency's southern Europe in domestic production of a disadvantage compared to Germany.
Only by cutting public spending and revenue -- to which encourages Germany.
For the current problems with the budget and currency is deeper cause European languid performance.
As a result of "green" energy policy supported by Brussels - code for the support of the French and German companies at the expense of the consumer - the European industry is twice more for electricity and four times more for gas than it is in the United States.
This is paralyzing the disadvantage in terms of cost, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not all the freezing salaries in the world would have forced the European petrochemical industry zadupání cheap oil slate from the US.
The result is a smoldering rebellion, particularly in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that Germany will be held in check and allow Paris to stand in the world at the level of Washington.
Berlin and Paris as the card doesn't need political legitimacy and pushed for its own economic policy in Europe and worn the French economy to fend for itself.
The result: The National Front of Marine Le Pen, anti-European right wing, had just won an additional choice and subjugated the ruling Socialists in third place.
The line is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote - an early warning to the British Labor, that they cannot conclude that the split of the right to automatically positive effect on the left.
As Le Pen disposes of its newfound popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create the anti-European bloc against the common currency across the European Parliament.
If they will do well in the elections of the anti-European party, which is likely, he can dominate a block for the first time in the history of the European Parliament.
I can think of that in the foreseeable future is growing anti-European feeling and attitude would kill to unite against the common currency, the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transformed into something less rigorous (sovereign) within the meaning of the "Europe of Nations," already favored General de Gaulle.
Several of Germany and its satellite economies may have left the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore its own currency.
I expect that the United Kingdom is from this project will go the distance and come to the United States.
But increased interest in Washington on the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to atlantickému cold.
And where will Scotland?
We can choose to be areas (basically) Little England.
Or we can defend their own economic interests - in that era and the possibility to Berlin and Brussels, where we have to be.
I suppose that Scotland would have fared well in the loose arrangement of Europe provided that would preserve its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in nefederální Europe of the Nations.
Otherwise we should take an example from Norway and to maintain their economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland - oddly - is the most successful political movement neprosazující austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 due to the opposition stance against planned cuts to (and implement) Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland voted for independence because only now, to adopt austerity measures laid down by Berlin and Brussels.
The parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate gender."
Germany became the first European nation, which recognises the third gender in children born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The newborn children will no longer be ranked only either a male or female gender.
The new law from parents is not required to provide for such children either sex, and allows them to their birth gender sheets of paper as "vague" or "unspecified."
The aim of the law is to stop pushing for parents that their child rashly decided for the operation in order to determine the sex, and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersexuální.
One person intersexuální, according to the BBC, after many years said: "I am not a man or a woman."
I'll stay slátaninou created by doctors, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that each year from 2000 children born one, which is not a boy or girl.
Intersexuální, are part of a group of about 60 of the facts, which are covered by the diagnosis of disorders of sexual development, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testes) or unusually developed the genitals.
Intersexuální could be Wallis Simpson.
Determining the sex is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States said it could not be determined if sex, it is better to use the best available information and identify them, instead of waiting and watching until the child's psychological and physical development operations are carried out, if at all.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist who specializes in the problems with the designation of the sex, he said, that the new German law "looks like a good thing."
Intersexuální children pose ethical dilemma.
"Some people are in life-threatening condition, which requires an operation, but for most children, that is not the case," he said.
Sex determination can be made without the operation and then they can wait, how identity is evolving.
The knowledge of how to work out for the child's gender is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question, why is this happening.
It is a mystery why some people are homosexuals.
The report described the European Committee passed in 2011 intersexuální people as different from transgenderových or transgender people, because of their status is not bound to sex, but on their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and it cannot be clearly defined as not one of them.
These features can occur in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle volume, the hairline, breasts and figure in the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and the genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination, which is experiencing intersexuální and transsexual people working in the field, and also the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
The boys no gender nonconforming now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal mark in official documents already allow adult male, female or "third gender."
Norrie May-Welby 52letá Australian, became the first recognised worldwide in June "sexless" party, won a court appeal, so that he could keep the status of "vague" by the end of the life of sex.
According to the Ministry of the Interior will have the German passports but M (man) and F (woman) and a third title, X, for intersexuální persons.
In neighboring France France 24, according to news reports on the issue of sex is still controversial.
Dozens of French legislators in 2011 from this strongly Catholic countries have signed a petition to the "gender theory" was removed from school textbooks.
America's website and online is against German law also define and wrote: "with the way the world is scraped to a new state, where sex is not a matter of choice, but sexual activity, převracíme inside out two other pillars of civilization."
One mother of an infant from Maryland for Baby zone, also said that he would prefer to see that children have allocated gender at birth.
"parenting itself is stressful and without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of their child," said the Web pages on parental care.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, the children with both male and female sex called hermafrodité, according to the handsome River, who had dual gender.
About ten years ago, the medical community and thought that sex is something like a table, which can erase and redraw again.
But now many are questioning the ethical basis operation with it, may decide that gender is a complex issue and doctors incorrectly, because they don't know how, because of their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"in the middle of the 20th century was called the psychiatric emergency room," Drescher said.
When the children were born, you call a psychiatrist, but a surgeon.
The prevailing theory about how to deal with children with ambiguous gender, was presented to Dr. John Moneyem at Johns Hopkins, who took the view that sex is soft.
It has created a new concept of "sex" and arguing that the social causes and environmental influences - both parents raised their child - acted on a child's genes and hormones and shaped regardless of whether the child was identified as a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as the "John/Joan" with his theory has become controversial.
The parents of a boy whose penis was damaged because of poorly made obřízce, recommended that their child had been left completely castrated, removed his testicles and it was raised as a girl.
"Media has presented the case as a successful case of conversion, but the reality was different," Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, left the přeoperovat back at the boy and married to a woman.
In 38 years, however, he committed suicide.
Drescher said, that some doctors use this model" to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, the survivors of these operations have discovered "unhappy with the result."
This was the case with Jim Bruce, 36letého writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes, but the ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors were not sure whether it has a large clitoris, or a small penis, and were convinced that a man could never live "satisfactory life."
And so shortly after his birth in 1976 were Bruce surgically removed the bodies and balls and was raised as a girl.
In the 12 years he got the female hormones.
"I knew that I was not a girl," said for ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask that question.
At 18 he was sent to the plastic sheath.
But because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was frightening.
After the birth I was sterilised and no one I never said anything.
Bruce was born with the disorder of the development of gender (DSD), who defended the body to produce sufficient quantities of testosterone to properly develop his genitals.
After he had learned the truth, turned back to the man, taking the dose of testosterone and let you remove the breasts,
The operation caused his infertility.
Today is represented by others in the organization known as Interface Project and the perception of those who are trying to normalize intersexuální.
But Anne Tamar-Mattisová, director of the legal group Advocates for informed choice (supporters of an informed choice) is based in California, is concerned that the German law "calls for branding and stigmas."
Many activists fear that German law reaches that will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose "vague" for a child," said.
We're afraid it bids for intervention.
We believe that it is better to allocate male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know how the law eventually lead, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattisová said that her organization supports Australian law, because "it allows adults choose to be included in the third gender."
"adult should be able to make their own decisions about sex legally valid," she said.
German law is going to assign him at birth.
It is a battle that, at this point, shouldn't seduce a small child.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about her own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratzová radioložka chest from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law "shall be granted powers" of both parents and children.
Baratzové daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but the DSD called syndrome numbness on androgen.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, developed by Katie feminine features.
He has a vagina, but does not have the womb and ovaries.
Now Katie 29letá is married and works as an intern in the studies at the University of Pennsylvania in child psychiatry.
Although it is barren, hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogate motherhood.
"The law gives parents some room for its decision to take their time," said Baratzová.
It gives them time to perform certain tests and change his mind and give them this time than they write "husband" or "wife".
In this respect is all right - his child raising and love it.
You have wonderful child and glad of it.
You don't have to hurry with the operation, which is irreversible.
"It brings the possibility to participate in decision-making, as well as a child and withdrawing the anxiety that parents are constrained, because they do not have the assurance that they are doing the right thing," she said.
In the end, the child will decide with which gender is more shares - and that's a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The bird was flown from the oil rigs in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was brought to shore after he was found exhausted on the oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One Rail was evacuated by helicopter to Aberdeen last month after it had been nursing Scottish SPCA company in a rescue centre, until he recovers.
Operating center Colin Seddon said: "This Rail probably surely from northern Europe, when it caught the wind over the North Sea."
For all his strength and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr Seddon added: "was not able to take off again, so we contacted the requests for assistance."
At a time when he was Rail released, was in good condition and healthy.

Phonetic|Kilo Drabek: Uhlířský Hill - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlířský Hill is conspicuous hill 3 km southeast Bruntálu.
Along with a few other evidence of volcanic activity is low in the mountains in the time (geologically) recent.
The last eruption here were still at the beginning of the quaternary.
When viewed from a distance is at the top of the hill Uhlířského conspicuous white stucco Baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Soil, built in 1755 - 1765.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn, who was standing next to the church, had survived.
Shortly after the completion of the church was discontinued alley of the four series better, about 1 km long.
The path to the top Uhlířském is already the third version of clubs, the original stood here in 1916, the second, from 2001 to last only until 2004.
At fifteen zastaveních are wooden sculptures, which drew local artistic carver Phonetic|Foxtrot Nedomlel.

Much of the pedestal of rocks from the field here is an interesting geological exposici.
At each stop mentioned the name of the sponsor.
Uhlířský Hill is the rest of the young volcano.
Though the figures differ somewhat from radiometric measurements of old age, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is, therefore, younger than Velký Roudný (3.3 million years of age and older than Venušina volcano (0.8 million years old.
The volcano was born in the explosion.
While it has rejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash and rock fragments of bedrock, which acquired by firing a reddish brown color.
At the end of this phase - today, it is a layer of porous basalt lava flows to the surface to 13 meters powerful.
The other flare disgorged red, russet and points to black underdeveloped volcanic tuffs of leucitic lava.
The layer of up to 50 meters is powerful and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In tufech are striking volcanic mountain lions large to 1 meter I tipped outburst was the second eruption of lava.
At the conclusion of the activity of the volcano, the lava poured out, which today accounts for up to 50 m powerful struskovitého basalt layer.
The volcano, which follows the gutting of volcanic ash with outlets are the most common type of lava volcanoes.
Because they are, in fact, made up of layers, were given the name stratovulkány.
The original volcanic cone was subject to the gradual erosion.
He was threatened, however, to the exploitation of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intense mining here took place between 1953 and 1962.
Underdeveloped volcanic tuffs of leucitic lava is added into the concrete, which was then easier and better insulation properties.
Mining is managed under the pressure of experts and the public to stop and thereby preserve this unique place.
The problem is, however, in a small voids the cohesion of the rock, which can be worn down, crumbling and shedding down the slope.
LOM so relatively quickly disappear.
To make matters more complicated, it's warm, oriented south slope an ideal place for some rare species of flora and fauna.
Correction is so problematic, but time will be selected and maintain a geological profile.
It's nothing new, maintain similar profiles on a number of important sites.

Anger over the verdict handed down by the masterminding the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the bombing in Bali in 2002 responded angrily to the judgment handed over the last of osnovatelů, who were brought to justice, and said that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted persons in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for having assembled the explosive device, which was used in the bombing.
For 15 years he could be paroled.
This 45letý man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, after which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many of the wounded.
He was also found guilty on several counts related to terrorism, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution has demanded a life sentence, although it could insist that the man with the nickname "Demolition Man" (bourač) thanks to her professional reputation for the production of explosives was given the death penalty.
This decision revived painful memories of June Corteenové, the mother of Perth, which in a devastating attack run Patekem and other osnovateli almost a decade ago lost their 39letá twins Jane and Jenny.
With tears in her eyes, she said, that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the agency AAP Ms Corteenová said: "should be tried before a firing squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I see other grandchildren and their daughters.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground, when she was 12 October 2002 shortly after 23 hour fired a powerful bomb placed in a van parked outside.
Peter Hughes was in the bar Paddy, where only about 20 seconds before a suicide bomber detonated a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion on the month he fell into a coma, and while he was kept alive on life support, "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said that Patek should meet the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiyah responsible for the massacre - Amroziho Muchlase and Imam Samudru - who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty as one.
Keep him alive... no reason to keep him alive, it just isn't.
Get 20 years for this, that killed 202 people and wounded hundreds of others, is not all that much.
Patek stood before the court as the last of the Bali bombers.
The arrest avoided almost ten years, but in the end he was captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later, U.S. forces killed a former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports have revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden and al-Qaeda in an attempt to re-establish the link between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia.
"voluntarily gave up," said Mrs Corteenová.
To this day he felt regret for it, how much grief caused the other.
The verdict comes before the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will later this year and to which they belong to the ceremony in Bali and in Australia.
"This year we'll see a lot of tears," said Mrs. Corteenová.
Patek is still can appeal against the judgment.
Pope Francis is the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced that Pope Francis on February 22 for the first time on Thursday named new cardinals of the Catholic Church.
Cardinals have the highest position right after the pope in the clergy of the Catholic Church and are those who elect the pope, so Phonetic|Foxtrot appoint his first group of men who eventually will help to choose his successor.
It is now 201 cardinals.
As soon as the Cardinal reaches the age of 80 years, however, already is unable to take part in the election of the Pope - the group that reduces the 120 voting cardinals.
In a statement notifying the report Father Federico Lombardi, the Vatican spokesman, said that the meeting will take place before the promotion ceremony of the new cardinals, known as current cardinals konzistorium.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate its decision to convene February konzistorium in advance, in order to facilitate the planning of the Assembly, which require the participation of other cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of sheet (Voices said that the number of voting cardinals in February is likely to decrease.
He said that the pope usually called so many cardinals, how much is needed, the number of constituencies to be increased again to 120, and so many cardinals above the age of 80 years, how much he wants.
Konzistorium next year will be significant, because it will be the first after Francis was elected in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment is a certain orientation to Europe, and Europe, in particular, Italy.
It will be interesting to see whether the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world, to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics is in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
It will also be the first choice of cardinals since Phonetic|Foxtrot appointed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, which gave the task to find ways to reform the Church.
In the past the pope ruled all for himself.
"now Phonetic|Foxtrot selected the eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He said that it was "quite possible" that the cardinals, the pope asks for advice.
In this situation, but we weren't before - it's the sheer novelty.
Valero said that popes traditionally povyšovali at position cardinals, bishops of the big points, but Phonetic|Foxtrot is "full of surprises - so we don't know who is."
Announced a series of racing Land Rovers
The interior is racing to a six-point seat belts and also intercom.
The choices are improved brakes, service package to ensure access to re-calibrate Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between the races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of the Bowler Motorsport, said: 's participants, who come to Bowler, have changed."
Not all are experienced racers, but these are people who want the excitement and adventure and also achievable path to world class race.
We are pleased that we can offer them this way in cooperation with the Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in Britain and overseas, and that hardness and prepare a contestant on the reality of the Rally Raid.

Living legend Wayne Shorter will conclude next week the Strings of Autumn

Dans out November 6 in the Great Hall Lucerny together with his quartet in the composition of Danilo Perez and John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening to Shorterovi adds the spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the leadership of Martin Kumžáka.
In Shorterových adjustments for symphonic orchestra played the Pegasus piece of news albums Without A Net, as well as his older tracks Lotus and Prometheus UNBOUND.
Although celebrated the Eighties birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which shows that the Prague concert at the strings of autumn will take off his world tour.

The Secret War: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama, how to bomb Syria.
American commandos in Libya.
Top GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis demonstrated exactly how it should look like the bombing of Syria.
Without undue noise, threats and million of the statement sent the aircraft, you hit the target and returned.
Without the left idle official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
All the action and refused to confirm the announcement.
The exact opposite confused and unsupported mall, acts of Obama's Syria policy.
And most satisfying in its attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don't be fooled by the media to their claims that had been bombed Syrian base" or "supply for hizbaláh."
I recently wrote about it here, that while US aid secular rebels in the country remains on a rhetorical level, so Russia merrily on supplying weapons to Syria.
And that the fresh supply of Russian rockets landed in the port Latákija became the target of the Israeli raid.
The clear message.
And note, Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although it according to the popular Internet theory should be the other way around.
The US government malfunctioning 2 spaciálních units, probably the Delta Force members.
He didn't know until now that will distinguish themselves during the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi.
A heroic death of two former member of the SEALs, who defended the CIA is known in the city, according to me they were members of the secret commandos of the CIA, which is made up of former soldiers.
For a long time to speculate what they did the SEALs on the consulate or even in the CIA's residence located elsewhere.
Now it is clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has protected offices in Libya kulometnými nests (just to one that both members of the SEALs were killed after a mortar), is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about the two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the American commandos in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi voluntarily come forward to intervene, together with five private kontraktory coming his way to the site of the CIA in Benghazi.
The Obama administration Itself fact that during the attack, it was not officially deployed and the whole squad and that was just hesitant about what to do.
The squad leader, so without orders to release these volunteers.
In any case it, that the country is not in a lump sum, but permanent American commandos, CIA agents and private kontraktoři is quite interesting information.
And that in view of the fact that, until recently, officially admitted anything like this and I are now talking about some advice to the NATO mission in Libya.
But it's good that the US as well as measures to combat terrorism in Libya.
Even if it wanted to help to resolve the national situation would be much greater.
The last place secret and enduring conflict, today I want to write about is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, what the media almost opěvovala Iranian air force for the prosecution of American drones.
Little is known, however, how the Americans their drones effectively protects.
Of course, if they can find its drone in the airspace, you can't do anything about it.
If the Iranians drone in international airspace is discovered, however, the situation is quite different.
And that has happened, that the Iranian aircraft chased the F-4 Phantom American drone in international airspace over the Sea, which was perhaps the first deployment of American super sharp F-22 Raptor fighter in history.
The pulling Phantoma to visually checked his equipment, without him Phantom registered on the radar or just noticed it and then when it suddenly appeared with him and invited the Iranian pilot to return home, he did so without complaint.
No wonder when Phantom is the American production, which, however, remembers the war in Vietnam.
With raptorem can be compared.
The court blocked the stopping and searching of a police department in NY
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the court order requiring changes in the program to stop and search people at the police department in New York and the judge removed from the case.
The US Federal Court of Appeal said that the decision of Judge Shiry Scheindlinové will be deferred until a decision on an appeal lodged by the city.
Judge decided in August that the city violated the Constitution so that implemented its programme of stopping and questioning people.
The city came to its conclusions and its corrective regulation, including the decision to allocate the surveillance, which would have helped the police department to change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday requested a postponement.
The appeals court said the judge must be withdrawn from the case, because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for judges, and that a judge acted in accordance with the requirement to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public comments, which openly responded to criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, when they wrongly focused on blacks and Hispanics as part of its programme of stop and search people.
Set up an independent supervision, to oversee the changes, including reforms in the procedures, training and supervision, and ordered to run a pilot program to test the cameras worn on the body in some areas where there are the most common stopping people.
In August, the city of New York agreed the storage methods of names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The appeal of the city are scheduled for oral arguments sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of stopping and frisking people criticized a number of civil rights activists
There is a certain form of stopping and frisking people for about a decade, but the recorded tour under the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg's independent dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases it was about blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, wrote the four men, all of whom are among the minorities, an action that has become a class action case.
Supporters of the changes the stopping and searching people conducted by the police department in New York, argues that the changes will put an end to the unfair practices, will increase the credibility and the effectiveness of the police force and may affect the way these procedures used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but no crime, and that is all the more wasted money, but will not solve the larger problem, which is a police force under pressure after his numbers have decreased in the last decade of several thousand people.
The judge noted that ended the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but reform the way examinations of the police department in New York introduced.
The CDC issued a directive on allergies in children for school
In the center of the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help in the case of pediatric allergy to food in school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the US government, and that because of that, the number of school-age children who suffer from food allergies, to increase.
One of the 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The directive for schools contain information about how the faculty and staff to recognize the paediatric allergy to food and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if it occurs,.
Also recommends that schools have the adrenaline - most often used for automatic injector brand EpiPen - to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature recently updated rules that allow schools to store the adrenaline easier.
The report also provides a list of typical symptoms occurring in interviews with the children, who have an allergic reaction.
The child might say: "It is like someone banging into the language," "I have the feeling that I have hair on the tongue" or "Svědí my language."
As the Tipsport (not) erasing personal data.
More than a year ago, I did in the Tipsport.cz registration.
I'm here but subsequently finished, because someone just sat at the branch, who couldn't complete the registration of the Internet.
And because I didn't want to go to another branch of the registration fell, then I moved and it has changed my address and the number of card.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I can't do that, because I have another identity card number, address and that it's not just finish and that I have to ask for the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
What I did and I 24.10.2013 wrote to the technical support that I am asking for the removal of all of your personal data from the database under existing law on the protection of personal data.
On this day duhý wrote me technical support that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
The marathon began e-mailing for technical support, where, in the end, after 4 urganci 25.10. wrote that the personal data on my request erased.
A man would, therefore, he said, that could make the new registration and began here again the problems as soon as possible, wrote to me that my user name is already busy (understand was deleted - this is not a personal data, but they also this).
So I used a different user name and jumped on me that my personal data are stored, to complete the registration at the branch (as they may have saved something argues that erased?), so I contacted the technical support again.
To my question how is it possible for me to be written, that personal data actually erased 25.10. and to send e-mail with the mistake.
I did this (around 15 hours) yesterday and today, I replied that I was registered on the same day (31.10.2013) in 13.22 and that is why I can't do that, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about that contact technical support for a week and then with them that it still can't.
And what about that if it was true what (is not like) says no one would be able to register with the same name and the same birth date if this is already registered.
Just by the way I was actually registered in the 13.22, on the same name and date of birth, but I used fictitious e-mail and telephone number and wonders, appeared to me for the moment that they sent me to e-mail a link to complete the registration.
How is it possible, as they could not be registered in the same name and date of birth?
Probably because the Tipsport tied the registration to e-mail and phone number and date simply has not surrendered as saying.
So again I told this to technical support that simply lie (either intentionally or they don't know what they write), because that's what writing is not true.
I added a few screens that the problem with the registration was "false" 31.10. so registering at this simply does not have the effect.
To me it Tipsport wrote the stark sentence - I'm sorry, but that you have already registered again, we cannot check your claim.
And communication ended.
And repeated over and over the same sentence, that is tied to the name and date of birth registration.
They can't even accept the fact that registration was not completed by clicking on the link in the e-mail and that, in fact, neither has taken place.
If it gets sorted out, not only that the Tipsport not data as they claim, but still is lying when he claims to the contrary.
The worse is that it can be easily, as they lie, and trying to make it appear that the fault is on the side of the customer.
By the way, after the launch of this matter on my personal blog, set in motion a little things and e-mail came from the Technical aid that the matter be forwarded for review and will be informed (urgencí and after a week of wrangling and warnings on the same mistake).
Sorry about the killing us, but we are innocent, defends the leaders of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was the number two in the hierarchy of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan, the former head of state.
Under the rule of the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979, which was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution of more than three million Cambodians, then at least a quarter of the population.
The commander of the notorious S-21 prison granted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010 a life sentence in prison.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan is defended by the fact that they believed that they are acting in the best interests of the nation and didn't know what is the true extent of the killing.
"It is easy to say, that I should know everything, everything to understand and, therefore, to intervene and to remedy the situation," Khieu Samphan said Thursday before the court.
I really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I didn't have any power," he added.
Nuon Chea has said that he never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "with people mistreated or killed them to odpírali them food or commit genocide."
But admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public for the victims, their families, all of the Cambodian people," he said.
Pětapadesátiletá Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, the agency told AFP that he could not accept the apology of Nuon Chea."
"He lied to us."
"just wants to be vindicated."
"care, on the other," she said.
"If he orders his subordinates would kill," she added with the fact that the leaders of the Khmer Rouge are "worse than a monster."
Before the court should stand," the foreign minister of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, who died in March of this year.
His wife Ieng Thirith, former social affairs minister, in September 2012, the court found unable process because of dementia.
The Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Fantastic ice cream, which glows in the dark?
The British entrepreneur built the first ice cream, which glows in the dark - for the use of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of a marine animal and developed the treat.
The idea came when he read the scientific treatise on a jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China, to chemically produced a protein that causes phosphorescence.
This ice cream eater responds with language - increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes her radiation.
Chris says that the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more lick, brighter September.
Charlie, the company's founder zmrzlinářské "Chick me I'm comfortable" (olízni me, taste great), says: "It's an amazing substance, but in terms of production, we are at the beginning, so you get for £200 about 2 g of this substance."
We use a protein, which in ice cream, reacts with your language at neutral pH.
So how your mouth protein heat, increases the pH levels and ice cream begins to glow.
We tested it in the last couple of months and it seems to be a great idea for the celebration of Halloween, because it causes this fantastic brilliant effect.
It is probably the most expensive ice cream, which I have ever made, because luminescent jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
And that cost me about £140 each mound.
But it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for his unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and leaves of gold.
His other product but is to be even more ambitious.
He says: "I really wanted to make an ice cream."
In essence it is impossible because of the quarry of light caused by ice crystals that form an ice cream, but I figure with it, that we can find a way to do it,.
The ice cream using fluorescent jellyfish properties, artificially produced by Chinese scientists.

Martin Doktor of problems with the Olympic games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is demanding
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile and then he says: "it is difficult."
Cooperation with the organization of the team for the Olympics in Sochi 2014, according to Dr. Martin is a little more complicated.
On what was the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing is not working as well," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A number of things working more slowly and not exactly.
It is a confusing.
From the point of view of invoices are relatively fast, not so much in terms of delivery of information about material things.
Maybe one páčíme has three months to give us, as it will be officially marked the village, we could do a whole range of things.
We're still waiting, and they still say they communicate that thing.
In a number of things still communicate.
Is he at least finished the Olympic village?
But it's not catastrophic situation.
A month ago we went after the empty rooms.
Fortunately, houses cost.
That means that are empty?
The floor is to be done?
The only concrete base, so that the state was a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even if there is a danger that, when we get there on January 26 as the vanguard, will there still feel the glue.
And if nestíhali, so what?
President Putin would mean there forced the army?
Just as it was about to fall.
But that is not what it was, that the Olympic village = Potěmkinovy village.
More likely won't, for example, adjustment disorders, nedodělají details.
Maybe they will have the way in such a state that we will have to take with him the boots of the London Games.
But I believe that that kind of put back together.
How many of the Czech athletes would have to go to Sochi?
Now, there are roughly 78, although that number changes depending on nomination competitions criteria.
They seemed to be skaters in the trio, what's left.
The rychlobruslařce Martina Sáblíkové also need not doubt, but otherwise it is in development.
You're in for the trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I'd have to go to January 26.
Both houses will look like in the Olympic village, we know.
Even some of the things we measured the subway, so that we don't just drawing.
We are preparing a whole range of other things, too, including transport.
And what does the boss of a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
Preparing for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports plus doing routine agenda in terms of communication with the Organising Committee in Sochi.
Place the tenderloin post-election post-election Beans
The October elections rather than the winners have brought a bunch of losers.
It is not only the parties, which are in or out of the Chamber of Deputies (SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and eventually ČSSD due to an internal split.
Politicians get us instead of the tenderloin holiday weekend post-election stew.
Springer elections happened Andrei Babiše movement, which promised voters to change the political style of governance.
The fragmentation of the electoral outcome and dissension in the winning side recording political (from) will Mr President Milos Zeman regardless of the wishes of the voters who supported President Zeman's party publicly, nor did to the House of Commons.
The president had lost because of unpleasant events strategic policy ahead of the others, but it still has several ways to get it back - for example, the choice of a future prime minister.
While ČSSD the chance for a prime seat in my eyes away, traders Andreju Babišovi closing.
So far though the post-election developments is miles away early and smooth the creation of a stable government, but in comparison with the pre-election scenario of ČSSD left-wing government supported by the Communists, this development is the better news for business in the Czech Republic and thus the economy.
Given the loud opposition YES get together with the ODS and TOP 09, is still the most likely coalition scenario ČSSD, YES and KDU-ČSL (a total of 111 deputies).
Because of the split in ČSSD, which thus became illegible and weak parterem in negotiations, the outcome of coalition negotiations can be daunting enough for ČSSD.
The minority government ČSSD lodged with "nezemanovců" at the Castle probably won't pass.
In addition, any government, to which the ČSSD will participate, will be jeopardised unmet ambition of many of the Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further split in the party.
I'm asking myself: 'Nespějeme unassisted to another early elections?"
Another option would have been more of a referendum on the strength of the voters' mandate of the YES movement.
ČSSD plans for the introduction of the tax sector, the marked increase in income taxes or the building of the State Bank fell hopefully under the table.
The ČSSD, YES, 19 and Dawn, on the contrary, agree to support business, for example, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to promote the employment of disadvantaged people, the lower tax rates for the selected goods.
Friction is most prevalent in the view on social policy and the size of the state.
Yes, but now has the upper hand, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, ČSSD, 19, leaning more to the right.
From my point of view is that, in the end, a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything else in the economy moving.
More recently, it seemed that the majority of the people in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Have been cited as the reasons of corruption, the squandering of money for overpriced purchases and state contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, the government scandals.
According to the results of the elections can be drawn, that the majority of the citizens of this state suit.
That they did not mind and with the status that was (theft and debt of this state, they were satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that the 3 413 497 voters there to vote, 596 357 voters voted TOP 09 384 174 voters voted for the ODS a total of 4 394 028 actually supported the original ruling coalition, which represents 52,16% of all legal voters.
That is an absolute majority.
As a result of the above parties put 1 016 829 voters ČSSD, then the old order (because all the parties have been involved in the "theft" and that state borrowing), then with the condition actually agreed 64,23% of legitimate voters.
This, in fact, a majority of voters made it clear that they are not for the punishment of the guilty rozkradení and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or you might think that the ČSSD members, who are involved in this endeavour appropriate laws?
We help at all?
Olomouc opens in the historic center of public rink
The organizer of the Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating rink Pavel Spálený said that the preparatory work has started on October 26 and from Wednesday's operation in aggregate for the production of ice.
The ice layer is already seven inches thick and into early Friday morning, the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The area rink 375 square meters, took the podium 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two stands with punch.
"We expanded floor space, increased the space in front of the stands and almost the entire area of the podium is roofed so as to the skaters could comfortably přezouvat," described Spálený.
The streets of Olomouc recall the approaching Christmas.
Last year was the rink for a revision of the Lower Square installed directly in front of the main entrance hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square area of ice was completed at the end of the summer, so she can get back to its original place.
For the first time people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the rink in operation from January to March.
A sheet of ice then became an integral part of Christmas markets in the city.
Christmas markets, which is part of the rich cultural program, will be launched at the Upper Square a month before Christmas Eve.
The scientists more illuminated the movements of the tail is connected with the mood of the dog
Earlier studies have shown that the radiant dog wags his tail more Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog), while nervous dogs waving tail mainly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say, that the other dogs can detect these subtle differences in the movement of the tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a from the University of Trento said: "with the people it is well known that the left and the right side of the brain are of different link to the incentives, which are positive or negative emotions."
The same thing we tried to discern in other species.
He added that, just as it is in humans, dogs, too, is the right side of the brain responsible for the main movements, and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotion.
In an effort to gain more information about how the dogs respond to uneven wiggling tail of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals, which followed the films of other dogs.
Measured the heart rate of these animals and analyze their behavior.
It will not be long before we understand why their tail is sometimes on the one hand, and on the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "project we dogs movies about dogs - whether in the natural version, or in the form of a silhouette - to get rid of any confounding incentives, and we also have been able to adjust the movement of the tail and illustrated it more to the right or the left."
When she saw the animals otherwise lackluster move the dog's tail Justify|Right (from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), remained quite calm.
When but recorded video tail mainly Justify|Left (again from the perspective of a dog vrtějícího tail), their heart rate has increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said he does not think that the dogs through such movements of each other would knowingly communicating.
Rather, he believes that the dogs learned from experience, to which the movements he must and does not need to be careful.
He said: "if you several times with the dogs and the movement of their tail in one direction is frequently associated with more friendly manner and move to the right breed less friendly behavior, you react on the basis of this experience."
The researchers say the findings may help the owners of dogs, vets and cvičitelům better understand the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a university teacher veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said that it was not the first study, which examined whether left and right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turning his head to the left, while watching an aggressive dog, and on the right, when looking at a gay dog.
And in another of the paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, said: "the dog robot dogs are more likely to be acquainted when wagging his tail to the left than the right, which is becoming more insecure - exactly the opposite from the Italian study."
The difference may be given to him by the dogs in these various studies of animals in the movies or dog robots nevykládali quite like dogs.
He explained, that could help the study of how the dogs respond to real dogs.
"However, in the case of many different mammals, there is strong evidence that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified - and the dogs are no exception," he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, probably won't be long before we understand why it is their tail sometimes, on the one hand, and on the other.
RBS suspended two traders with foreign currency
According to two people familiar with the situation suspended Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) two traders in their division with a foreign currency, which is another indication that the global supervisory investigations involving shady with a currency market is becoming more and more frequent.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they will cooperate with the competent authorities on investigations of the world's largest financial market, where the owner of 5.3 trillion changes every day.
The two traders would have been the first RBS staff suspended as part of the investigation, which is a response to a scandal with the manipulation of the Libor rate (London interbank interest rate).
The bank declined to comment on suspension, but confirmed that this month has received a request for information from the authorities.
"Our continuing the search continues in this matter and we have fully cooperated with the FCA and our other authorities," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the people who are close to this event, said that RBS had forwarded the British authority of the Financial Conduct records of e-mails and instant messages sent from the accounts and the accounts of the former trader.
The businessman, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and it is assumed that he had been released from his current position of president of the foreign currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European chairman of trading for cash in Citi, on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of the trade in the currencies in Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week by Standard Chartered.
Neither of these traders has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Mr Usher for sending instant messages to the group were bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, said the people of an initiation into this event.
He expressed this week after the Swiss bank UBS Finma supervisory authority announced that it was investigating suspected wrongdoing in the foreign currency market in several Swiss banks, has taken steps against some of its staff.
At least six offices around the world - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss anti-trust office Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice in the US and the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong - is looking into a claim that these bankers partnered to moving with a currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also triggered an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
The bank's sweeping years old with quick messages and e-mails to find cases of offences.
The report on the investigations startled traders in the area, which has been one of the biggest engines for profit in the investment bank accounts in recent years, but that was disrupted by a currency volatility limited opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers were trying to reduce the severity of the situation, he said that with the vast and highly liquid market with a foreign currency, it is virtually impossible to eradicate, but senior traders say that it may not necessarily be true.
A senior trader said that despite considerable volume of trading in the foreign currency liquidity dismemberment between different trading platforms and banks increasing use their own internal platforms means that "you can begin to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices."
The report came on the same day, when the company Credit Suisse announced that this week's release of his department for trading in shares of the trader, which caused the loss of almost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately alerted the authorities and cooperate with their supervisors.
"We believe that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been solved," said Credit Suisse Company.
The government was negotiating with Klaus and Spidla.
Now the PP Jana Kasala sent against Babišovi.
Fourteen members of the PP won in the elections, only one-third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of YES.
Enter into negotiations about the government but with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already started to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, Jana Kasala - the man who have a Christian matched the conditions of government involvement in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats nor Andrei Babiš do not have such a matador on his side.
I think it will be this time to remind the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also completely new party.
"experience were minimal," estimated Kasal, as this year's talks will evolve.

Maybe he will reportedly cost about him, the New York Rangers, who have gone astray entry into the season and, in addition, have wounded two mainstays - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan's attackers.
How's your arrival into the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.

Unfortunately, I would like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Nor do you from the club have?
Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.
There are about to get into a situation where the contract that really does.
When a player is to be hurt or that someone can't and the team steps.
There's a lot of different factors, which are required to meet together, to get the contract.
But in New York just similar circumstances arise, isn't it?
The injured man is Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan and the team had entering the season, so there is a chance, don't you think?
Of course, the chance is always.
But the second thing is that you always need two parties.

That is the reality, unfortunately, in which I have to live with.
On Friday, you are flying to America, you are within expectations, that would be something we just have to go smoothly?
I have the expectation from July 5, when he opened the market to free players in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York, to be reminded?
I'm not, I'm going to Tampa for the kids and a wife.
I look forward to the sun, and to see you again.

That is the fact that I'm a father and husband and from it all depends.
At the moment I'm not a hockey player - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I will play the role of my dad and my husband and I'm looking forward to it.
In Sunday's Vašík two hockey games, that is for me and my whole family holiday, when we can go to support our children, what they want to do.
You think that you could do this full-time in quotation marks?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
Even that may arise.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And very, very fun for me.
Once it gets to that stage, that all the goals, it is no substitute for victory and passes you, what you have at home.
Because the family and children, that is the meaning of life.
Whatever you do, what you want to do.
I had a job, that it was the most beautiful, what could have happened to me except for the family.
You had a lot of offers from Europe: You have it so that you want to play the NHL just because it's the NHL, or is it because of the family, that you want to be in America?
Since I'm a hockey player, so in the first place - in addition to the family - and sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And since this is a family life.
My children, so sorry, our children - my and my wife - grew in the United States, were there to go to school and so on.
And we would be very happy if the trend continued in this.
Because what are you kidding, in America are options elsewhere.
We should give them a chance.
The plan is to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice as now.
This means that, in the summer, we will be in the Czech Republic on Deep and Ceske Budejovice in the vicinity.
And in the winter in Tampa, or wherever they take us back our steps.
It is less than ideal, be still warm.
I had great luck in life.
You might say that, I went across the street, said that a lot of manpower and self-denial and took me to a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in turn offered me a lot of opportunities, and this is one of them.
That a woman can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world, who after this thirst, so that they can choose what they do and how they live.
How long will you have in him at his age will work hard, work hard and wait for an offer?

Score by the jazz quartet with the saxophonist Wayne Shorter's current feelings of musicians.
According to his entry to the two generations younger colleagues play what is now experiencing.
Treat the music as totally improvised chamber issues and think they have not of harmony or rhythm, but in the film images.
This principle, however, the octogenarian Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammy, a former teammate of Miles Davis and today was probably the greatest living jazz saxophonist - I don't like to explain.
Don't talk too much about music, although his overall view of life is closely linked with the music.
At the age of eighty years I came to the view that it's best to keep life as no surprise.

Along with the Czech television sometimes free of their signature events?
The legendary scene with popelníčkem stepped into the era of President Zeman, and so it is not hard to listen to the complaints, which collects evidence of cronyism of the castle of the company.
In the past Ivan Langer tradovaný influence or Jaroslav Tvrdík nezdokumentoval, let alone one as he signed under it.
True, the leadership he showed editors.
The cases described, however, do not provide an answer to the question, where such affection of some journalists to zemanovcům notes - whether it is a response to a direct order, or, to use the language, a typical speech impertinent empathic embrace.
And when we assume general prohnilost, unable to forgive the question of whether the change in circumstances on television without the other, equally unscrupulous power interests, which has not yet been given the opportunity.
The truth to those who say that in the developed countries there is intervention attempts by politicians to broadcast the show.
But it is also true that this does not mean that there were complaints of public service media there.
The complainants do not call into question their independence.
The criticism, mostly what they consider slant, that is their own, that is the fruit of their subculture.
Maybe we just do this civilization stages have grown up and this situation is not with us.
Perhaps, but also in the country, which he thinks that is the most corrupt in the world, the stories of the evil politicians in black and white and good journalists spend more comfortably than more complicated descriptions of the chaotic situation in which he was referring to the behavior of many imperfect human beings.

He stood against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, how his beret at a funny angle and let his two-year Toffeeho parade around the ring.
Fenton was the judges praised for their natural ability to control the horse, which are far higher than his age.
And Toffee earned the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffeeho got in March to their third birthday, and since then, with the following Shetland pony train every day.
His mother Donna (30) said: "Fenton and Toffee great work."
Don't get your hopes up, but in the end they left a golden cup and flowers.
It was only the second time, what with Toffeem competed, and when he won, we were very excited.
Everyone thought it was a very strange people wanted to take a picture with him.
The boy from Nantyglo village near Ebbw Vale in South Wales is following in the footsteps of her aunt Sharon Howells, which demonstrates the horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howellsová says: "There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and clapped."
He ran on sand along the length of the arena and although worked so closely, gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals - loves horses, tractors and farm and was in charge of two chickens.
Whereas, as he will be back soon to the Horse of the Year competition and I am sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual competition show horses said: "Fentonovi are only three, but he knows how to control a pony."
Form together a great team.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffeeho for their excellent speech and for the way the show on the competition circuit.
Always follow, how good is a team effort between the pony and thus, who leads him - and Fenton with Toffeem were on ovals best.
I'm sure that helped Fentonovi cute clothes, there really stuck with him.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with the monitoring of the US
Edward Snowden, a rat from American intelligence services, announced that it is willing to go to Berlin, the German Parliament to give evidence, if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander will not be able to provide answers to questions about their activities.
The German parliamentarian Hans-Christian Sträbele met on Thursday with Mr. Snowdenem in Russia, where he was granted asylum, and acted with him about the possibility to testify in Germany.
In a letter from Mr Snowdena, that Member of Parliament passed the media on Friday in Berlin, he states: "demonstrably positive despite the result of my efforts, my government will continue to act as the opposition to defectors and trying to criminalize political speeches heavy claims that don't make room for defence."
To tell the truth, however, is not a crime.
In the letter Mr Snowden said he believes that the support of the international community could persuade the government of the United States to withdraw the criminal charges brought against him.
The charges include espionage and the theft of state assets by the Ministry of Justice of the United States.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of the Interior, for the magazine Zeit Online said: "if Mr. Snowden is ready to talk with German officials, we will find a way to allow it."
The tension in the relationship between the US and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone began to rise, when the allegation that the NSA eavesdrop appeared.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament, who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, he said, that if there was any opportunity to hear Mr Snowdena as a witness "without running the risk and that would be totally destroyed relations with the US," it should do so.
Mr Sträbele, Member of Parliament for the German side of the Greens, published a picture of the contribution, which is on its twitterovém with Mr Snowdenem.
Two German journalists accompanied him on his trip to Russia.
Mr Sträbele Mr Snowden said that the NSA, according to former contract lawyer would have been able to return to Russia, where he once drove away.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would be the assurance that there will be "safe," said a member of Parliament.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a rough and sustained campaign of persecution, which forced him to leave the home.
He said, however, that the world's reaction to his "act of political expression "encouraged him.
The citizens of its senior officials - including those in the United States - also reviewed unreasoning revelations of widespread monitoring system for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with German authorities," to the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved."
To nezalknul hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After the long years when he read, he lived, but he did not write, issues Phonetic|Victor Kahuda (1965) new novel Wind, dark presence.
That won't work on thin volume, the number of parties comparable to his best-known work suggests a forest (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu canvassed other significant Czech writer present - Emil Hakl.
That is where the movement, after 12 years of silence that you wrote a novel?
I did it - to nezalknul hatred.
See around still new and new clones that human foolish vanity, young organisms Guests blind selfish endeavors.
I'm not talking about us not, faces wrecked helpless lust, vekslácké soul and vice versa přepólovaní ideologues, who are trying to sell their "product" with an expression of little harlot.
At the beginning of the millennium I bought a small digital camera and filmed his jurodivé friends, eccentrics and secret services.
I'm not now.
Sometimes I can feel my brain of life on this planet is on fire.
I go for a walk and then in the evening light reading books.
You're talking about a sense of frustration, hatred.
There was a break in the past, that affect you, or just getting old, too, like all of us?
A breakthrough came in about 10 years ago.
When it didn't have a name.
Well, and after that I lived.
But there is still surprised a quiet boy.
I can see further isolated cvikýře, each in his own tornado anxiety.
Saved me writing books.
I had this huge, thousands of years of continuous movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of the discipline of the future.
The vast, breathtaking complexity of life when each stone is the direct beneficiary of our presence.
We are sad for the players and the beautiful game, which means the trial-and-error process becomes more and more interaction biliónech being a second generation creates a superhuman, artificiální intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
You perceive their writing as a continuous process, or you started from scratch?
Talking to herself, or rather the dialogue, which lead the right and the left half of the brain, sometimes floats and forged in the book.
As the period of peace are laced with sleeping metastases quietly wars, which is perhaps one day wake up - so my book is dressed in twelve years of silence.
I felt I mute an avalanche of life is growing in the brain, and if I don't do anything, so one day I quietly sinks.
It's a set of questions, which formulated the brain and by the classes, which are stored in the darkness beneath the surface of consciousness."
Neokortex, gray rind of the brain, asking older evolutionary services, to the ancient letokruhům think tree.
Speaking to srstnatým beasts, asks the snakes, is looking for an answer in the flight of birds, raised his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law within me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain wonders of the world.
Relatively often speak to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
Stored in their brain billion Communications and electrochemical connections all the memories, experiences and the experiences that the man lived.
This forest logically and emotionally exposed and větvících trees of information, the register of memory, the brain uses in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to continuously variable presence, in continuing to try to identify and understand their surroundings and decode the important information.
Sometimes arise from the congestion.
By analogy - as if you "hit" PC emulator of the Speech and interpreter of foreign languages would first get tangled in the operating environment, such as Windows, and after several unsuccessful restartech ended in dark green BIOS screen flickering in the basic system, which manages the functions and cooperation between the processor and the memory of onboard, etc.
For those who have not yet understood what it's all about - I'm talking about psychospirituální crisis.
They speak of it often - why you just interested in this type of recourse on a regular basis?
Because this is a hole.
In most of the functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there is a gap.
There's a good quote Nietzsche: "staring into the abyss, the abyss looked to him for so long."
A genuine feeling - that man is lost when they disappear all hope, mentally "dies" and starts a new quality.
And why it interests me personally?
I answer parable.
Once one fell into the pool and drowned, ran the days, months and years, he is still drowning while reading the books and taught him to swim - that is, live.
It had become "a diver."
Perhaps someone will help me a written sentence, as once helped Hrabalovy texts me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, at a particular person, who will read your text?
That, of which cannot say anything meaningful, some call it the knowledge, another of the super ego, but it seems to me the best characterized Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I is someone else - that the reader is directly involved in the formulation of words and phrases."
From an early age he had read the books of the old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nemo's submarine ran after Stínadlech in dark alleys.
In the end, for all that branching authors and their message is clear: "The sun worlds other Karla Hynka Cliff."
And when the book is out?
It depends on your čtenářově view?
On the rebound, that people who read the book, gets across to you?
Of course I care about the opinion of the people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of text.
And then, maybe after years on the street at random contact me and thank me, that I helped my book them in some of their heavy lifestyle decisions.
The books are in fact "lives" or rather "worlds."
The characters are encoded in the letters, the experience, the history of the language.
Whenever we can revive, leaving their sentences flow to the brain.
It is, in a way, something zakázaně divine - waking up more and more of the story, small universes and temporary planet.
It's the fact, whose DNA is stored in lines - under the old démonologických books make witchcraft.
After the release of the books you - as it is - is waiting for the author's reading.
I remember that you once read like.
Toss ahead again with pleasure, or you feel that after years of otherwise?
Now I'd rather just as telling.
And what I found out?
There are good, intelligent people.
Their basic character - are unobtrusive, too much on him unsought, to provide friendly, don't you feel lonely with them.
I give an example - lived in Cerveny Kostelec town was (and I hope that he's still alive) one curly-haired bookseller (is conveniently Červenka), cheerful sidekick and good girls' bull.
When one pijatyce introduced me to different sections of the readers of my book chain scrum.
I looked them in the eye and then I was shown rozdrbaný očtený copy of my book.
I am embarrassed set just reading jitrnici and briefly male wept.
We all stood there in silence, weaving and drunkenly slzeli with emotion.
Then the young blond half-breed lasted and jumped over the head with a roar from a window into a snowdrift.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran into a landscape and What happy rabies citlivců, aching souls krajánků and longing Remote Patriots - howling gales and how werewolves until morning.
Each of your book is formally and materially different than the others.
It is also the story of Wind, dark presence?
It's the story.
It is a tale of one country for the nine rivers and the nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his amendment Suchodol, Czech Republic inserted into his mouth the words of one of the old popular Healer Russian legend: At sea, on the ocean on the island Bujanu.
Psice, lies on her gray chests.
The horror, the horror, the secret.
It had never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were a long time ago devils in hell and lots of - what role we play in this country.
Are you going to write on, or let it again on the free flow of inspiration?
The answers are forever - Otokar Březina.
The writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and nameless, like the movement of continents on the planet, affects our will range from such a depth and in such that completely beyond our horizon - and so as a matter of course we are doing exactly in terms of its programmed award.
We were rewarded by the tide of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We biological machines.
We want to mate, die in defense and the acquisition of new passenger territories.
Sometimes happens failure and glow of sympathy.
We only have the right to call themselves human beings.
This is the answer to your question - biological robot is now filled with various disorders, the unconscious is standing on the shore of the ocean and in holes in the sails made of dirty handkerchief catches inflows warm wind.
I have to write, I could be the man.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In the hours of English literature will be read at least one of Shakespeare's plays, novel of the 19th century romantic poetry and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The test will also include the "hidden text," to the incentive for deeper reading;
The combination of English literature and language courses will be canceled.
From 2015 will require students to have the graduation examination of language, and English literature will be encouraged to choose as an optional subject.
The Department of Education should tomorrow - the first to issue a new curriculum for English and math courses, which are to undergo a radical change.
In other major items of the changes are waiting for the next year.
In a separate move the Ofqual Office, which oversees the graduation test detects changes in the structure of graduation tests, along with a new system of grading and less volume of projects for students.
In his speech in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our system of rehearsal, in order to regain the confidence of the company," and that it should be to insist that the graduation test was "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
The study shows that the English schools spend less time mathematics - 116 hours a year or three hours a week - than most other countries.
For comparison of the school in Australia in mathematics 143 hours per year on average, and in Singapore about 138.
Although no official request to devote more time mathematics, coalition sources have indicated that the comprehensive graduating math test results - along with more emphasis on this subject in the rankings - probably will encourage schools to provide extra classes.
The curriculum will focus more on "the problems of the real world," including financial mathematics.
Ostravský Mayor Kajnar: Cancer in ČSSD is not me
Before the election, the full ignited long-simmering dispute between the two wings of the battle for influence in Ostrava ČSSD.
It all culminated in that, when the mayor of the city of Ostrava Petr Kajnar turned on the court because of undemocratic establishment candidates.
The players didn't want the cause is yet to comment too much more damage to the party before the elections.
But the votes of the electorate are numbered.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD so right on Monday night called the mayor of the city of Ostrava, that emerged from the party, and will probably push to come to his office.
Petr Kajnar but wants to fight on.
Disputes in terms of what and who is on whose side, described the exclusive interview to the Daily News.
How you perceive the outcome of the election?
ČSSD must be counted with a much better result.
It damaged her with us, that will address the media before the election disputes within the Party?
I can imagine that the outcome of the election could have better social democracy.
But on the other hand, it is a condition in which ČSSD now is.
Is that the party, which has its own internal problems, is mentally ill and people see it, that all is not well in it.
In the election that gave clear.
What are you ČSSD internal disease?
The decline for some time, to me, is going through the ODS and things like that, unfortunately, now taking place in social democracy.
Isn't it, that the lobbyists, influential people, who had previously expected, they find that their prebendy in the ODS, moved to people in ČSSD and have an impact on them.
It comes after the Oslo airport offices, then it has to do with the police and collects computers.
It shows that the ČSSD is composed of people who would like to think of the good of all the others, but many of them, in particular, for the good of their own.
ČSSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps and in Prague, as can be seen even in the current struggle for power between Haškovci and Sobotkovci.
But it is preparing for a long time.
So, what took place before the elections in Ostrava, was just a precursor of what is happening now in Prague.
Haškovo wing gradually obsazovalo position, so that they could make the situation after the elections, which will weaken Sobotkovo wing.
A man is in politics in a situation where sometimes must compromise.
Each has some internal border, but when you don't compromise, and it is also my case.
Initially, I didn't want to run for the House, but when I saw the whole thing within the party, so I made a deal with Lubošem Zaorálkem, that will try to get to a regional candidate, has strengthened as the mayor of the city of Ostrava Sobotkovo right wing.
Haškovo wing but could stop.
Why are on the side of the Bohuslav Sobotka, and not Michael Haška?
Mussels Sobotka to me is a man who always talking mainly about ČSSD and, to some extent, the visions for the party and for the country.
I confess that I didn't hear anything like that from the other side.
Michael Hašek just fighting for power.
I don't understand, how can the Bureau, which is lower than the central authority of the Executive Committee to begin just refer to the President of the party.
It is a struggle for power, regardless of everything and against the statute of the party.
According to me what now Michal Hašek demonstrated in Prague, ended his political career.
As you are aware that you Ostrava leadership candidate ČSSD approve.
Political parties are based on competition, who are both members of their places.
The competition should be, for the most part, based on the programming visions and the ability of the people you meet the vision.
Of course, however, by the competition report as well as people who don't have much ability and vision, but a political party is an elevator to the money for them, which they didn't get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people start getting to the forefront because unscrupulous violate the rules violate the statutes of the party.
They are doing their practices of the Mafia and the political parties to me that violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than me to take into account that, if a Kajnar has a political future.
It is important for the parties to respect the charter.
That's why you have passed a motion to the court before the elections for an interim measure against candidates ČSSD form in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district Executive Committee ČSSD in Ostrava he consolidates his power by the organization, which he does not approve of, can repeal of the new organization is based, gradually firing uncomfortable members of the party.
An example of this, however, is that they want to exclude Richard Bednaříka of representatives from the club, but he filed suit against it and then they cancelled the resolution on the exclusion of better.
It shows that the parties through the courts to enforce the observance of the constitution is the last option, but at the time when the other ways and control authorities in ČSSD stopped working, it is the only option.
The leadership of the Ostrava ČSSD effort in the head with a member of Parliament Adam Rykalou's appeal to the position of mayor.
It is an open secret that the mayor has his eye on this post Poruby Lumír Palyza.
It is so, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza is trying to do everything they could appeal to me.
They promise to the people of the position, gaining votes and then for the voices of consolidating his power in the party.
When I go back to the past, so everything has to be passed around the football club Baník Ostrava and purchase the stadium Bazala, was just an excuse for them to be able to attack me.
It was artificially staged, so that I could be described as a man who gives money there, it doesn't belong.
The city bought the property, which is strategically valuable to him.
How do you see it on with his remaining in office Mayor?
The district committee had invited me and some other people on Monday to consider their continued presence in ČSSD.
I think that is so, as when a thief crying: Catch a thief!
When we look at the results of my work over the past 11 years, so I don't see anyone in Ostrava social democracy, who initiated and pushed forward, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developing things, such as industrial zones or extensions are the park.
Yet all I become uncomfortable.
Don't read it in a different way than that in the way the others piled on the place, after which he covets.
You will fight against these efforts have somehow?
Because if this one is the Republic work well, as political parties must also work well.
I find it hard to believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state, when he can't drive or herself.
Acknowledge, therefore, that I have now left the ČSSD, because I think this side, I'm not the one who causes cancer, but these people who are trying to drive me.
We want to show that, Plzeň still knows how to win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team was primarily výsledkově recently failed, a defender or midfielder Victoria Plzen František Rajtoral form that has earned him the following year to return to the team.
He's doing as well as a total arc of fire, carousing activity, after surgery on him in the match in Teplice was granted the penalty kick.
The balloon came in the last two rounds against Slavii and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end of these two exercises taking only one point.
František Rajtoral believes that his team in the match with an unpleasant series Jabloncem breaks.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that Jablonec home defeat," says František Rajtoral.
The team is in a tough fight with Severočechy, who play offensive football, carefully prepared.
Everything is going to match with Jabloncem coach prepares us well, as always we draw from a lot of rival videorozboru games as well.
"I believe that in Friday night, it will be a great game," the Czech representative lures fans in the stands of the Doosan Arena.
Pilsen last games didn't work as well as it wants, but the word crisis defender Victoria rejects.
So it goes in football, sometimes you have good form and sometimes worse.
But I haven't spoken in any way on the crisis.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," says defender Západočechů.
The victory will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"playing on Friday night and that I would like our fans, who are great, invite."
"I believe that they odvděčíme prize," adds Rajtoral.
Defense of academic freedom, it applies for Zeman and the ODS.
I have repeatedly urged the open letters in recent months, students, educators and the middle and high schools in several parts to defend academic freedom before the election campaign, which in schools by President Milos Zeman.
I met with more or less success.
The Principal of Masaryk University in Brno, which refused an honorary chairman SPOZ ZEMANOVCI lecture in the pre-election period, considered that got even retaliation in the form of nepozvání to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the schools, who have been so brave and visit Miloš Zeman possible Cloud|Eye Technical University in Brno, Gymnázium Hladnov in Ostrava, High School of business in Ostrava, Business College in Cologne, H.E. Purkyně University in Ústí nad Labem.
Now meet in Pardubice with continuing promoting policies at universities.
Newly elected MP for the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, in addition, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it really is not the same as if you had stayed, for example, in his capacity as mayor of a small town.
Do you want to include ČSSD vykovávají at the same time as the Member for regional presidents and general and as they degrade the profession?
That is, people say, that are difficult to handle both the left back.
I know we have an example of Michael Haška, which handles even a few dozen functions at once.
But it is not just an example of the person you should drive.
We find the opposite, as well as a positive example Štěpánky Fraňkové that better left's post, so that it can fully address the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to the dean's office, however, is that the combination of the functions you break apolitičnost academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The leadership of the various ODS sees your current tenure at both positions as an advantage for the University.
"their" school, however, you will be able to help you stay, even without the dean.
I think I have a similar view as president of Miroslav Ludwig, and I will have your students.
Consider, then, even his resignation and keep his face.
Otherwise, you may be that voters in the next election count.
And it may be short-lived.
John Kerry admitted: Spying has gone too far!
The United States went "too far" in spying on occasion, admitted to AFP Agency chief John Kerry during the videoconference American diplomacy between Washington and London.
The collection of information but served as minister to to prevent terrorist attacks.
"first returns from Washington," according to AFP said in the middle of a controversy on both sides of the Atlantic about the scandalous revelations about mass surveillance data to the US National Security Agency (NSA), which became the target as well as America's allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as did President Barack Obama), some of these actions have gone too far and assuring that it will happen in the future," Kerry said.
In an interview but, above all, defended the practice.
The collection of information as it is necessary for the fight against terrorism and prevent assassinations, as were the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the US bombings in Madrid in March 2004 and in London in July 2005.
"We prevented the aircraft fell, the building exploded and people were murdered, because we were able to be informed in due time úkladech," Kerry stressed.
Again, however, admitted that the collection of information" in some cases had gone too far."
The affair erupted around American intelligence, which allegedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans watched the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders hiding indignation and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States, which would have been monitoring or significantly reduced.
The Royal Commission learned that before claims against Jonathan the Lords were accused of two employees from Christian groups of young men (YMCA)
The Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children learned that before the Lords of the accusations against a child's keeper Jonathan was raised from the city in 2011, two employees of the Christian Association of young men (YMCA Caringbah) in New South Wales were charge of sexual abuse of children.
But before the commission said that, in his opening statement to the committee this association said that never discussing the case of sexual abuse of a child in your organization.
The Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about the case, which was one of the staff of the YMCA associations accused of offences relating to child pornography, and on the other, when P.E in the Caringbah YMCA of the association was convicted in 1991 of children for sexual harassment, which was in their custody.
Mr. Hare Gaili Furnessové, Counsellor Commission, said that he knew about the case, but not on the other.
He admitted that the start of the YMCA was also inaccurate, as stated that the YMCA in the organization to carry out external audits, which praised the organization as the champion of the rights of children.
The evidence submitted to the commission is talking about it, that the YMCA was alerted to it, that in an audit of the Ministry of Education and the company from August of this year, the second lowest of the four possible ratings.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA associations, when he was 21, he said, that the leadership itself from him down failed, when Mr Lord adopted, without assurances that it is aware of the staff of the obligation to report violations of the rules of the safety of the children.
Earlier this year Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, which has committed during the two years when he worked at the YMCA associations.
He was jailed for a minimum of six years.
Mr. Hare but rejected the claim that the YMCA associations have a cultural problem, which prevented staff to report security breaches of children by the Lord.
Staff members provide evidence that they were witnessing such violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, privately is watching, let's sit on his lap, they used to say that, like them, and he is playing with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwellová Lordovou a child and asked for the training of the safety of the children, because she worried his behavior, testified that Jacqui BARNAT, head for services to children in the Caringbah YMCA associations in the city, which was Lordovým superiors, was "very intimidating and often it was difficult to talk with him about something.
The Director General said that it does not accept the evidence of personnel that they felt uncomfortable, if they had contacted their superiors and report the facts.
Instead, he said, that their friendship with Lord clouded their judgment, and therefore nenahlásili problem.
Mr Hare said that the board of the YMCA associations in New South Wales state its view that the lessons learned from the case of Jonathan Lord" for the organisation lies in the fact that the staff "did not file any report," and the Council agreed with him in it.
Mr Hare said that the decision to have the staff to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged, made by General Manager for services to children in the organisation of the YMCA Liamem Whitleym.
He said that the aim was to avoid a distortion of the evidence, but was "overly zealous" and poorly executed.
An expert on sexual abuse of children by Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffithovy YMCA in New South Wales, said the commission was not in the years 2009 to 2011, which would be safe for children.
He said that there were serious problems in recruiting, screening, training, personnel training and leadership.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
The president of the Union of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic Václav Matyáš: New green economies should continue.
Czech construction is dealing with continuous decline in the volume of orders since 2008 and indifference to the state to resolve the issue of investment construction.
Publication of the programme New green economies was a positive signal for our construction, especially for small and medium-sized businesses in the regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for the citizens, who after the implementation of the measures save significant amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and the manufacturer of building materials.
Each invested one billion would bring the state more than 2700 of newly created jobs.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state are significant leverage and the multiplier effects, it is also one of the most significant growth measures.
The Association of entrepreneurs in the construction industry in the Czech Republic, therefore, in principle does not agree with the resolution of the government and calls for the implementation of such events, which would allow a continuation of the program, to be published in the context of his other challenges.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technological gains in aircraft (but may not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices from gate to gate" - in addition to calls from their mobile phones - reading, playing games, watching movies and listening to music on the basis of the expected new rules, issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) impatiently.
But passengers do not expect changes occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to the airlines, FAA administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines will have to manage the FAA to demonstrate how much their aeroplanes that comply with the new rules and update training manuals for cabin crew and the directive for storage facilities, in order to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received from some of the airlines plans to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"depending on the state of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in its statement.
At present the required of passengers, to shut down their smart phones, tablets and other devices, as soon as he closes the door of the aircraft.
They cannot be turned on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain gives permission.
From passengers, their equipment is expected to shut down again when the plane landed, and declined to nezapnou is, as long as the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines, whose planes are properly protected against electronic interference, to allow its passengers to use their devices during takeoff, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Since the majority of new transport planes and other aircraft, which has been adjusted so that passengers can use breakfast at a higher altitude, is expected to meet those criteria.
Laura Gladingová, president of the Association of professional stewards, welcomed the changes.
"as soon as the new rules will be implemented safely - and we - the airlines will cooperate closely on it, it will be a success," she said in her statement Gladingová.
Us frankly tired, that we look like "the guards."
But surfing on the Internet, send e-mail and SMS or downloading data will continue to be prohibited under 3 kilometers altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to their smart phones, tablets and other devices switched to flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, online game of Scrabble, played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smart phone in 2011, when, as is well known, was thrown from the aircraft to American Airlines, because he refused to turn off their equipment when the plane was parked at the gate.
And the heavier equipment such as laptops will have to continue to be imposed because of concerns that it could hurt someone if flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will be on board to continue to be banned.
The rules for the use of mobile phones does not specify the FAA, but the American Federal Committee for telecommunications.
The FAA may in some electronic devices during take-off and landing to repeal the ban.
Mark Rosenker last month from the National Safety Committee in transport, an expert on national security in transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones are still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really the problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with the navigational instruments, but we also know that in the air may cause interference from the FCC data transmission towers," Rosenker said.
Trade advisory committee created by the FAA, therefore, to examine this issue, last month suggested that the government would allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has in recent years come under pressure to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator Claire McCaskillová, a Democrat from Missouri, argues that there is no legitimate security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming more difficult to enforce, because of the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third passenger forgets to turn off their devices or ignores her.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the interference of navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radio, technical achievement of the times.
The new airlines are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but the aircraft are also designed and approved by the FAA, that was resistant to electronic interference.
The airline has already offered to passengers after several years of use of Wi-Fi in travel altitudes.
The plans prepared for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to jamming.
The vast majority of the airlines should adapt to the new rules for the greater use of electronic devices, said Huertová.
The current electronic devices generally emit radio broadcasts, much less intense than it was in the previous generation facilities.
The electronic reader, for example, issued only a minimum broadcasting in turning the page.
But the broadcast is stronger when they withdrew the device or transmitting data.
Among those who are pushing for it to relax restrictions on the use of such devices by passengers, is.
In 2011 the company representatives loaded airliner its Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
The members of the Advisory Committee of the FAA expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of airline passengers said he is convinced that the interference of these devices is real, and that, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only sketchy reports from pilots, to support the fact that such devices can cause interference of air systems, and most of these reports is very old.
The committee, however, recommended that the FAA allowed pilots ordered passengers off the device during instrument flying at low visibility.
A group of travel industry welcomed the changes, according to her on a sensible approach for the travelling public, that the technology used in abundance.
"We are pleased that the FAA acknowledged that it is not a pleasant travel experience in conflict with safety," said Roger Dow, the Executive Director of the American travel associations.
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said that American intelligence had "gone too far"
John Kerry indicated smooth defense of the US position on their monitoring programmes and, in an unprecedented admission, he said, that "went too far" in some cases of espionage.
The foreign minister also said that, together with Barack Obama is responsible for the fact that, with regard to the incendiary revelations about the NSA spying, which appeared thanks to an informant Edward Snowdenovi, acted as a "autopilot."
The disclosure triggered a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry through video-spojení on open government conference in London said: "there is no doubt that the president and I and others in the government have really learned about some of the things that the guns because there was the possibility of inertia, with reference to the second world war, the difficult period of the Cold War and then, of course, the September 11."
He became the first high-ranking member of the US government, therefore, who admitted that the American espionage crossed the border, but stressed that it did not violate anyone's rights.
He said: "in some cases it has gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain it to the people and to clarify and has now made a thorough review, so that no one had the feeling that the abuse occurred.
I assure you that in this process there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA is seeking the good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: "face of the new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is in the world of radical extremism, which is firmly committed murder and fire people up and attack the government.
And what if you were able to detect and stop it before it happens?
In fact we avoid falling off the aircraft, didn't they go off buildings and people were executed, because now we can learn about these plans forward.
President of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that the American lawmakers are going to Europe, to respond to the concerns from abroad, which relate to alleged American espionage, and convince the Europeans, that is to continue to combine their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and other parties this week and that he worried about their threats, that stops the participation in anti-terrorist organizations, because they are frustrated by the National Security Agency (NSA).
For the US national security interests, Europe is really important for us to stay in the same boat, and that with regard to the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, he said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and President of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on European affairs.
And I'm heading to Europe, I made it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe, upset relations with US allies, even though the agency's chief said this week that they have been inaccurate and reflect misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies gathered and shared with the United States
Other revelations cited documents compromised Snowdenem, that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other world leaders to 34.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper espionage allies defended as necessary and said that this is a routine matter from both sides.
In the midst of Murphy said that his office is planning a parliamentary trip, which should take place this year, and hopes that will arise in the delegation members of both parties and chambers.
In the next few days to be published the names of the other legislators who intend to participate.
He said that he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said that the aim of the trip is to help repair relations, he added, that they will be ready and "well-intentioned nurturing measures."
He said that European leaders must be honest to his own people, in respect of the spy programs, which for years on their own use.
"While we adjust their monitoring programs in order to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also must be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones here was spying," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry is going according to plan this weekend to the Middle East and to Poland to respond to hostility, has already raised the American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.

The rescue package worth $325 million for health tasmánské
The federal government insists that the rescue package worth $325 million for failing health in Tasmania contained tough conditions, which will ensure that the State Government nepromrhá funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliberseková announced that the Australian League is "urgent measures" to avert the crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a greater number of chronic disease and system disorders.
Funding for four years, was decided after government consultations with tasmánským independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package, which we believe will solve specific problems facing the state," said Mrs Pliberseková today.
The package includes $31 million to $325 million of the operation at the request of the patient.
Another 2,600 operations including orthopaedic surgery and a cataract operations will help eliminate debt.
The money is also to freely accessible clinic in Hobart and Launcestonu, better post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and placing personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
These investments will respond to the ideas on which leading clinicians told me that the best way to help tasmánskému healthcare system," said Mrs Pliberseková.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict regime of reporting and record-keeping obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding, to have received the money the Commonwealth, and information on where the additional funds have been spent a month.
He will be appointed a three-man committee, which will ensure that the state provides services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million will be for nothing," as long as it will be followed by a real reform in order to lay a more sustainable basis tasmánského public health system."

"The reason I'm here is that the Labour government removed from our healthcare system of 430 million dollars," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have the state government, which removes almost half a billion dollars, and the Australian League, which spends $300 million, and pretend that it's good news.

In ghettos police specialists, will probably have to ease tensions
In ghettos in the Czech Republic would police specialists should act in the future.
It would spend up to half of their errands.
They would have to order and solve problems.
Thanks to his knowledge of the environment should contribute to the reduction of tension between the people of the impoverished areas and residents of the neighborhood.
In its proposal to reduce the security risks of the counting of the Ministry of the Interior.
According to him would help to improve the situation in the country," the provision of social housing."
The document negotiated by the government.
According to the analysis was home in the Czech Republic a couple of years ago around 300 towns and neighborhoods.
About 80,000 people lived in them, and that most of the Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, the families were dependent on benefits, fatherless children in "special" schools.
Rank usury.
According to the experts problem sites, in the meantime, about a hundred added.
Relations between the people and the other is worrying.
Anti-Roma marches were held in several places.
People from the neighborhood joined to the extremists.
According to the Interior ghetto areas is difficult for the police to maintain security and order.
The essential condition is said to be "consistent application of equal access in law enforcement."
But that was not possible without detailed knowledge of the place and the people to achieve.
A specialist would go to run errands in the ghetto, where they would spend up to half their services, the rest would serve in his district.
In the troubled location would oversee the peace.
He would also be local, so that it could better address the problems or minor offences.
"Thanks to established trust specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole range of misconduct," said Interior.
Specialists in ghettos would receive bonuses, and that 500 to 1,000 kroner per month.
The introduction of special police officers in problem areas in Norwegian funds to pay them.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now roughly 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic holds 15 percent of the funds 85 percent.
The preparations began this year, is now working on a detailed proposal.
The project is to last until 2016.
The authors are inspired by neighbors.
This mechanism is successfully applied for a number of years in Slovakia, where the problem is the socially excluded locations far higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are the so-called Roma settlements," said the authors of the report.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic, is not yet clear.
The answer is to give the analysis, which will determine the place where he would need special policeman.
Will also depend on how much money to those of the police following the completion of the project will be able to release each year.
According to a draft of the project first selected police officers receive training in Slovakia.
A year that training should go through five of the dozen members.
Result from them the most suitable candidates.
Arise should also special training for police officers, who will operate in ghettos.
According to the authors would help to improve the situation mainly social housing.
It should be said to motivate and lead to integration.
In accordance with the wishes of the Interior would have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precise rules, such as the number of people in the room.
Central Standard would be in smaller apartments.
The higher standard should social housing, which would be comparable with current housing.
Tenants would have to meet the integration plan, which would build social workers with them.
They'd have to comply with the order, to take care of their health, to send children to schools, retrain and actively looking for a job.
If the inclusion of trying, advanced to a higher standard of living.
The annoying housing system should operate under the Interior at least 30 years, until the next generation will grow in the pro-integration motivovaném environment."
The model of social housing are preparing the portfolios for local development and work.
To have him until the end of the year.
Together with Bárta anti-corruption police arrested the inspections and analyst
On Thursday night, when a report began spreading information about the arrest of Vitus Barty brought the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found that the case has taken charge of the inspection of security forces (GIBS), its people have Bártu arrest in the center of Prague.
It happened in front of the hotel, the Four Seasons.
The inspections are dealing with cases, which are among the accused police officers, its jurisdiction, however, applies to civilians.
According to MF DNES is among those arrested and one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - leading analysts and Informatics Petržílek Jan.
He had worked in the past for Security Information Service.
The anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej but refused to comment on the information with stipulated that the media must apply in this case just to GIBS.
Even her inspection spokesman Radek Sandorová but didn't want to say anything on the case, in turn referred to the public prosecutor's office in Prague City.
"This question will be no comment with regard to the protection of classified information," said prosecution spokesman Štěpánka Zenklová.
Also from this vague response can be deduced that the event took place, but it is in stealth mode, which does not allow the speaker to say anything concrete.
In a similar situation is even Bart's lawyer Oldrich Poverty.
He told the media that represents Bártu" even in this matter," but given that a classified information, Bártovo can't confirm or deny the arrest.
Some media speculated that Bártovo arrest could be linked to the former police president Peter Lessym.
The press office just Bárta together with the former VV Radkem President John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute, which is why flaring between ex-premier Petr Nečas and VV even had to deal with and then President Vaclav Klaus.
I don't know where the link took on my person.
No one contacted me, I have not been interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about things," said Lessa iDNES.cz.
In January 2011, Lessa became chief of police.
Officially it was pushed forward Radek John, a leader of the party but was then just Bart.
Bárta now ran in the election for the Dawn movement, narrowly escaped his mandate - about 175 votes.
The leader of the Dawn Tomio Okamura said he has no idea what this is about.
"Vit Barta was one of many many party candidates on the ballot, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, there is not even a member of the Dawn of direct democracy," Barty dissociated himself from Tomia Okamury Okamura, who said before the election that gave Bart space to run for Dawn, because he helped solve the problem officers.
Vit Barta found himself in court in 2012 with his former spolustraníkem from VV Jaroslav Škárkou.
Foreign workers with visa permission might undergo the test "justification"
With that, the government plans to expand the police interventions, is considering a test "justification" for foreign workers with 457 visa permission.
The test, if adopted, would be enforced mediation criteria in order to prevent the 457 program was used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a back door for the removal of family and friends in Australia.
When the news article, the former Labour government was issued today by Mrs Maxine McKewová condemned the government's rhetoric on foreign workers with words that might offend the Australian neighbors.
"loud statement at the end of the queue of "foreigners" and "work as soon as possible for the Aussies' are very unpleasant a relic from a time when unions have called for the labour market," said today for Australsko-Indický Institute.
Historically, it meant that should be protected by the whole work force - and I would be surprised if anyone in this region recorded an echo of this historical artifact.
News Article finally 12 measures, which had been considered the former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was last in Sri Lanka, where officials are due to people smuggling, implement five of the recommended changes and other left for consideration.
If the criteria adopted the "legitimacy" of visa applicants can be scanned in detail, whether" is nominated for the situation, which is a candidate or a personal connection with the owner or the relevant person sponzorujícího company."
After previous experience with companies intending to sponsor a small number of workers, but then hired hundreds of them, the companies also may need to justify the number of 457 visa holders.
In the meantime 35letý man from Sri Lanka, who sought asylum, died of a heart attack after he arrived this week with suspicion on asylum boat at Christmas.
The man's terrified nine-year-old son traveled to Australia, along with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he told a cousin, who was also on the boat.

The villa had moved to the suburbs.
Ivan grew up and spent much of his life in the apartment house with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague vilových Ořechovce neighborhoods.
The original owners of the house but it gained back in restitution and tenants had to move on with a small severance.
Ivan quickly because she was looking for alternative housing for himself and his elderly mother.
From known got a tip on a flat 3+kk in older panelovém house on the other side of the city.
"At first it was a shock, but the sight of the fourth floor of the massive dam and a forest park thrills me on the other side," says Ivan on first impression.
At first I thought it would be a stopgap that for three years.
"Today we live here more than 13 years, and not only because of the gradual reconstruction would remain unchanged," adds the owner.
Mother and daughter had migrated from stodvacetimetrového apartment into smaller with an area of 62 m2 and almost all the equipment only.
The action was not simple, things were stored with friends and gradual arranging took almost a year.
A new apartment was in pretty good shape, but had to take place the necessary adjustments, such as painting doors or windows exchange.
The previous owner he resented the core, but the most inconvenient or and unnecessarily large hall, and, on the contrary, a small bathroom.
The merger of the two rooms of a multifunctional living space.
The architects used for the demarcation of the zones and the layout of the room drywall, allowing the new lights.
The first shot, to which, after a few years, she was the removal of the bars in the living room.
The apartment 2+kk disposition may have changed, but the room has received the airiness and opened with a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step was to a partial improvement of the standard compensation for PVC laminate flooring.
With a bath, Ivan didn't know of the council.
For years I source magazines on housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting implementation.
The recommendation was not addressed a young architektku Kamilu Douděrovou.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," says Ivana.
Thanks to the launch of the bathroom managed simultaneously edit and present the hall.
Architect joined the space toilet and bathroom and two doors with otvíravými wings replaced one sliding, thereby sparing instead.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently accessible.
High-quality tile imitate sandstone, in the shower is more comfortable seat, in the toilet bidetová spray.
The successful cooperation with Kamilou Douděrovou went on.
In the context of the show how to build a dream was quick, but the fundamental change in the living room, which also owns the architect Martin Čeněk.
The area, which was created by a combination of the two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, without the help of the classical principles of optical division, for example polopříčkami or Japanese walls.
"That in turn would violate the openness and the unity of the space," explains architect.
He was originally separate sleeping and living part.
That was enough to bring back two sofas and build on the peace between them produced box on the covers.
The breakfast nook define shades of the floor and výmalby.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area used an architect of high-quality marmoleum sliding doors boosted the wallpaper pattern.
Kitchen in case of need they hide sliding panels wallpaper.
The new floor of antialergického marmolea compared to previous of fiberglass has a number of advantages: Softer nekluzký surface seamless and better sound insulation.
The system niches and suspended ceilings of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how it can work in the suburbs with space.
I left on architektech colors, I wished it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade as well as in previous quarters," says Ivana.
Pack of themed grafoskla blooming magnolias is practical and creates significant aesthetic element.
A warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underscored the modern functional style.
In a small apartment managed order books, among other things, to the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled remotely.
In contrast new interior předělaném works well with older, for example, with dozens of years old crystal chandelier and Ivan with high-quality works of art, which collects all his life.
The last of the series came in the kitchen.
The cabinet and the owner have previously been deployed on both sides have felt a little bit like in the tunnel.
Architect target their number and přeskládala deployment.
The furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface but slightly pearly surface.
In a small space fit thanks to solve nápaditému washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of the small kitchen revived celoskleněný lining the walls above the dash.
Unique grafosklo digitally printed with the motive is attractive, in addition to maintain good.
Ivan chose flowers magnolií recall her favorite neighborhood, where he lived for years.

Jana Péťová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but now that I think about it, it is not really a step, but a big jump - jump a few years back, and that in memory in my childhood.
It is the memory of what it was, not to have any trouble and just out of school and wash the dishes, vacuum and do your homework.
Although these obligations," it was mostly just a theory, the parents' wishes.
The practice was completely different - on the run from the school, put the bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with other children, jump shot.
After a series of Helen and her boys embroidery stitch řetízkovým festive tablecloth for grandmother for her birthday.
And then the subsequent warnings to wash dishes, it finally vacuum, in the winter of fetching wood into earthenware stoves and tasks to do until after dark under the lamp (or rely on classmate and instead of tasks to write love poems addressed to high school sweethearts).
In the morning breakfast of homemade strawberry jam (of real fruit jams, not those who sell it now, the contents of which lay beside strawberries even) and drink tea gathering of dried herbs, which we are so happy with my mom.
I remember those enchanted evenings, when the nurse was dead silence in the room when we facilitated the songs from the radio on the tapes, which was spun out loud in the old the record­player after mom.
And then we had a pencil on the tapes přetáčely and let himself over and over the same song, one of our favorite and siphon připíjely.
Or we get across the table aside for using cans, which were tied together with string - and while we're on the phone, we heard the better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean the ears, then uchošťour was the match + wadding.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live in such a way that we wanted nothing from it.
We need no those iPhones, iPady even cell phones and laptops or designer clothes.
The clothes are dědilo from generation to generation, and the best "addition" to the closet was a tie-dyed T-shirt domestic production for using SAVA.
The electronics took us to the satisfaction of my mom's said on a tape recorder and a maximum of the Walkman, so that we have shared with his sister and who we are, by the way, used as well as on the train on a school trip.
It's more interesting to play with his aunt POV Hop or Man, don't be angry, or, as I have said to go "all out.
When I was a little older got under the Christmas tree videopřehrávač sure parents saving for a long time, but unfortunately for him, for us for a long time been here a few days.
My younger sister to him narwhal strudel, said so beautifully Papal tapes, so she tried, even if spapá strudel.
Unfortunately spapal, but it was his last bite.
Well, and this incident is still poor, on a plate from my dad all the time.
He says that when she was little, narwhal strudel in video and thought, that it plays a recipe and played it, because it still can't bake.
I remember how we can all communicate, communicate with a cell phone, computer.
Together, we are on vacation at his grandmother's sister did with the neighbor's granddaughter, when we meet again next year in the summer for grandmothers - and so it was, as it were.
We came together.
Promise you now with someone, you'll see that in a year?!
I remember in the winter, when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmen, rode on a snowy hill at the church on sacks stuffed with hay.
Then we dined together with the family and talked about the previous day.
Of course we are sister slýchávaly before each meal that notorious sentence: "go wash my hands!"
Yes, it's true now, but certainly not in the bathroom to the tap přivázáné soap in a net of lemongrass.
After dinner, when my dad in the garage "worked" for beer with the village Jardou lehly we had with my mother on the floor, propped his feet on the tiled stoves, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackle of wood, which is coming from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't expect, how much we have friends on the social network, we knew how much we have friends, the real!
We communicate with each other - we talked about - we wrote daily messages across various lodges, SMS.
There was no such thing, and yet we know far more about each other.
And so I could go on for a long time.
It is a beautiful memories, especially those memories doplním-li by looking at this album, where they are due to the black and white photos of neatly put up black horns.
And if I happen to know how old I was then, from behind pictures is always written the year the picture.
I'm looking haircuts in the pot, though we didn't really suit her and, in addition, we should pants after poking about two sizes larger, we laughed before, so it was normal (not IN).
And he'd better go back on that step forward - into reality.
And I'm going to wait until 2013, what will think of the modern age should be one for my children.
What I know for sure is that these are my memories now for adolescents young generation that at least somewhere" from the age of yesteryear" and come on a lot, I think, that this "předopičí" while not too.
I would like them!
Save the must know the young Czechs.
Most of them but doesn't even know what interest
More and more of the Czechs to give money away.
Yet but do not have the champions in savings in the region.
Most of the money put aside for imposing the Austrians, who set aside a month on average EUR 181.
A little more than the Czechs save even people in Slovakia.
Results of the survey of the Erste Group Savings Barometr in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Savers showed in him, too, that the mood is improving and two thirds of respondents plan to put aside more money.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the savers, very few people still use savings products in Romania and Serbia.
For example, almost every other Serbian save home "under the pillow," according to the survey.
In the country this year increased the number of those who do save a month higher amounts.
Yet last year, each month on various types of savings delayed thousands to 2.5 thousand crowns 26 percent of the respondents, it's more about five percent this year.
The average monthly savings in a year-on-year comparison but declined slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is supplementary pension rights.
It gives priority to 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago, this was the most popular method for assessing the savings for only 36 percent of the people.
The declining popularity of construction savings, compared to the previous year's interest in investment funds have also dropped significantly.
You already uses only 16 percent of respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of the people.
The survey also showed that although people are considered important save, most of them don't know which returns on individual products achieve.
Young people in particular in 30 years, they don't know how their money is extended.
On the contrary the best awareness of their money has imposed the oldest group of respondents, among people over the age of 50 knows that 73 percent of respondents.
In an international comparison of the Erste Group Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which regularly used for 44 percent of the people.
Follow is the Slovaks and the Austrians with 12procentním apart.
The Australian's appeal against their stay in the Thai prison
Just twenty-one woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to prison on the island of Phuket, when patnáctidennímu falsely claimed that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, to appeal against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamfordová June 15 originally was accused of false accusations by the regional court on the island of Phuket, Thai police said that the driver of the taxi, along with two other men, who allegedly held her, attacked her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10.
But the record of industrial television later revealed that, after he broke up with his Australian friend, returned safely to his hotel.
Police from the island of Phuket led talks with Bamfordovou two days before, has confessed to making the story up.
Before the trial was held in a police cell.
Bamfordová was sentenced to 15 days in jail in a detention facility with a low level of safety on the periphery in Phuket, instead has been placed in prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of the former Australian player Peter Tunkse FA, which in the case of his daughter asked for the assistance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks sydneyskému told the Sunday Telegraph newspaper, that the whole family was "extreme concern" about the fate of her daughter and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously this is a difficult period, but we hope that they will come back to us safe as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamfordová to appeal against the judgment and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia states that, in the meantime, spent a vacation in the resort of Krabi in Thailand's south.
Legal sources say that Bamfordovou was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket in Thailand, but said she had received a warning that an appeal may lead to court proceedings, which will increase its punishment and will result in the location to a prison for adults.
But after the recent murder of an Australian employee travel Michelle Smith's office in Phuket, Thailand also may try to make up for the tourists battered image, which is perhaps worth liberating verdict.

Lyricist Michal Horáček brought to the Cologne Chamber Municipal social house not only their brand new dvojCD Český calendar, but mainly in the agenda between us singers Luna New, Francis Segrada and Ondru Rumla accompanied by an excellent orchestra Matěje Benka.
After a delayed opening side and acting Exercise musician Michal Horáček gradually invited all three singers on the stage, he came up with a candle in hand and reminded that story about how last played in Cologne and in the theater and in the city dropped an electric current.

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of parental leave scheme
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says, that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest because of the parental leave program, because of his daughter might become pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who runs a dispute over payment of the tax assessment of $6 million worth of coal, said this claim, when he tried to sweep the issue from the table, whether it is in a conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy a tax on coal and mining activities.
But Mr Palmer claimed that only ministers may be a conflict of interest, and he added that Abbottovy daughters were in a position to have personal benefit from the policy.
He got into a conflict of interest in terms of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters became pregnant, had a direct interest in it, whether he would get parental leave," Mr Palmer said.
Two months after the election of the Election Commission after the conversion of the votes Mr Palmer officially declared as the winner in the battle for a seat at the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast thanks to a profit of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer has called for a review of the election results, in order to speed the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should he decide on these elections two months after the closure of polling stations?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come and do the details to the computer, right to vote and to have the results at 6: 30 in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that the results can be repressed, if someone doesn't like it?
In this day and age it seems incredible use of pencils.
The Electoral Commission was studying the possibility of an electronic vote and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate, along with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer (59) said, that his political program also applies to the airport in the Sunshine Coast and that his new job would be taken "very seriously."
Public office is a public service.
"we no reward except that, that we can serve the company at this critical time," he said.
The new Civil Code is preparing six out of ten firms
On approaching the effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the law on commercial corporations from 1 January 2014 intensively preparing six out of ten firms.
Only eight percent of respondents representatives of companies argued that even discussing matters related to the two key codes in their company.
The survey shows that the law office Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the views of 108 of Czech companies.
In connection with the deadline approaching the effectiveness of both key codes have only now is beginning to recognize a number of managers at the last minute, which may have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
The biggest change in private law in the last 50 years they touch that in our view of all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
The manoeuvre politicians live in uncertainty, if it comes to revolutionary changes in the end, the business sector for a long time or not.
Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law, passed for their firms without complications," said the results of the partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Spáčil Jan.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively to deal with new codes, 26 percent said their companies already have taken all the necessary measures to be ready in time.
The 35 percent of companies of that number is going to take the necessary measures in the near term.
Every fifth firm rekodifikacemi so far has taken no action against it, yet the specific idea about how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent had no opinion and can assess the issue.
Only eight percent of companies rekodifikacemi now admits that matters related to grips with the issue.
The most important legal issue associated with the new Civil Code is for the largest number of new contracts (21 percent of the companies surveyed), followed by resolving trade conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the real estate registry and liability (after ten percent).
The contracts will be one of the most important news of the whole rekodifikace, and that union contracts only in the framework of a new Civil Code.
The current parallel adjustment in civil and commercial code expire, as a result, the law should become clearer for citizens and businesses.
"entrepreneurs in the new regulation will offer many news with an emphasis on greater freedom of relations," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Lukáš subject.
In the context of the law on commercial corporations is considered to be the most important topic of almost a quarter of companies increased liability issue statutory bodies.
The following topics related to changes in convening the meeting and (15 percent) and represent the company's (14 percent.
The new legislation means a tightening of the responsibilities and the possible impact for the statutory authorities, especially in the situation, as the company faces bankruptcy or to get into it.
In practice, this means that if the board members and directors of companies are not going to be taking care of the ordinary farmer and not imminent bankruptcy of the company, may lose the benefit obtained for the execution of the functions to over the last two years," said Spáčil.
The discovery of the NSA monitoring increases social paranoia on the part of the State
One peaceful day at the end of August, the German police helicopter buzzed over US consular office in Frankfurt, the main town of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BFV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to get a photo of the roof of the American outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media claims that the BFV had hoped that this action will be able to identify the presence of eavesdropping antennas, and launched the Berlin exchange of views between American and German Foreign Minister.
James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, in September again insisted that the United States does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities," that stole trade secrets of foreign companies in favour of US companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informer of a co-worker, began to reveal his valuable collection of the secret monitoring of the United States, European governments and business leaders do not know if they believe the words of the director.
After the news that the U.S. National Security Agency conducted espionage in the Brazilian oil company and has access to the data, with whom they have American cloudoví providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia about government monitoring of new dimensions.
The last straw came with the revelation that maybe ten years, Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was tapped.
If the target may be the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly a potential target, as well as business leaders.
Snowden zprůhlednil intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I would say that it is possible that the data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," said Oliver Grün BITMi, president of the society, which represents small and medium-sized companies in Germany.
According to a survey issued in July advisory service EY are convinced that the German company in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now represents as great a risk as China.
In the documents disclosed by Mr Snowdenem, however, so far there is no evidence that the United States passed the trade secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU is missing some skills in the field of IT and the Internet, and argued that they should seek to reduce their dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical of it.
The voices of the German Parliament, that we should make the German Google.
I just I can close my eyes and again is slowly open....
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, the president of the German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, he did not let him die over 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany subsidizes from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
The scope and the technical maturity of US intelligence agencies detected Snowdenem is for some companies, who are now believed that the biggest threat from China is monitoring, still shocking.
A big turnover in cloudové computing, where European leaders in a wider scope to recognize that the data stored in the US fall under its jurisdiction, and therefore are potentially irrelevant.
According to the survey carried out by the business community cloud security alliance neamerických about 10 percent of the members of the revelation of the US Prism programme on data mining cancelled plans to use cloudového provider based in the US.
Jim Snabe, SAP one of CEOs, says: "We have a new question for customers, that wasn't there a year ago - where are my data stored in this jurisdiction, and you can guarantee they stay physically?"
Many of the senior German officials argue that recent reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: That powerful states want to alienate their most valuable secrets and this data must be protected at all costs.
That economic espionage is carried out, it is not surprising.
It is always happening.
"It's a major issue for many years and has significantly changed that even during the current debate," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the agrochemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on the commercial and industrial level, just as we are conducting spying on them, because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
The company is generally do not want to boast protiopatřeními, which made, so that, if necessary, did not provide an advantage to the attacker.
In the case of large companies have long been recalls that take on the trade fair, free of charge, a USB memory drive or left unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unwise.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automakers Audi, says that it is common practice for many years gathering before the meeting of the Board of Directors of mobile phones, so that they could not be used as a listening device.
The German office BFV directors direct, to consider whether the use of foreign guests simple prepaid mobile phones because of the risk that smart phones can compromise.
Prepaid mobile phones, then fired.
There is concern, however, that the small and medium-sized businesses will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are global leaders in their specific areas of the market.
"to small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets to neautorizovanému approach," warns in its report BFV.
The US company warns of its own economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington post documents US National Intelligence Estimate stated in February to France next to Russia and Israel in the second row of the perpetrators, who are involved in the hacking activities for economic newsletter, and it now for China.
Board member of German risk-free society in terms of economic espionage, concluding that "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French domestic intelligence agency the DCRI, this month in one of the talks said: "services know quite well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, carry out spying on its allies."
The new vaccine against nicotine may withdraw the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which may withdraw the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine could for life to protect the mouse from addiction to nicotine.
Before the tests on people's need to carry out further tests, which take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical School in New York, says that the first indications are good.
"firmly hope that this kind of vaccine strategy may finally help to millions of smokers who have tried to stop and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but they found that their dependence on nicotine is so strong that, all the current approaches to overcome," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which was set up so that carried the genetic information for the creation of a antinikotinových antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begin to create a continuous stream of these antibodies.
The antibodies hunt all nicotine molecules in the blood stream and neutralise them before they get into the brain, thereby preventing a smoker of nicotine hit.
In tests of the vaccinated mice, which was subsequently delivered nicotine, continue their normal activities.
But the mice that were not vaccinated," the calm," said the researchers, which is a sign that nicotine they got into the brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccine failed because it contained antibodies.
The injections would be administered so often, in order to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so have proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower because of liver cells to convert the factory to the production of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the vaccine for the people of the future will be completely safe, they could be given to children before they will be tempted to try a cigarette, and to prevent that nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, it would be used by smokers to quit.
"They know that if they start smoking again, because of the nicotine vaccine will have no benefit from it, and it will help them get rid of the bad habit," he said.
British scientists have said that the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research is needed.
A desperate cry of Obama's voters
Obama voted twice - I shared the hope of a possible change
He said that Obama's sincere efforts to derail the Republican obstruction
Obstructive policy cannot excuse Web pages of Obama's health care woes or attacks by unmanned aircraft
Memoirs of Obama's campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris the second year studying medicine at Harvard.
In those days I read a book so sad.
I thought about this book, that inspires me during the grim days of my second year in medical school and restore a modicum of hope in me.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" (waltzing to victory) and memories of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When the evening finish reports of patients and I'm going to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches will take your breath.
The elections are over overwhelming and television news forced us to consider the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy and my parents have kept the paper, which got.
The young team headed to the White House visionaries and the nation was ready for a change.
During the office in 2008, Obama had the support of 82 percent.
And here the book closing.
Go to the present there is harsh awakening, as talk of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic days - seem distant memories, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
In the years after I threw my first election ticket, really has to change.
It was certainly nothing from what I imagined.
I acknowledge that Obama has reached a number of large and diverse achievements - from the law on the care available through the evacuation of our troops out of Iraq and end the policy of "don't ask, to say nothing" after the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe, partisan obstruction reverse so many efforts to move our nation forward: Among other is that immigration reform, the public option to choose health care and the closure of the base in Guantánámu.
But in many situations, when I was in front of colleagues and friends said the Obama administration, I, as regards the explanation, which can provide, came to the absolute limit.
I found myself in the place of political despair.
Obstruction for Republican Spain cannot explain the agreement with eavesdropping of foreign leaders with drones raids that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by them, that the National Security Agency collects data about the private lives of Americans, nor that haunts those who reveal improper conduct of the government.
It cannot be held responsible for the execution of an American citizen, Anwar al-Awlakího without proper court even for reducing public contributions and expenditures during the presidential campaign.
The findings of the report, which cannot be justified by them, he says, that the White House efforts to silence the media are "most aggressive... since the Nixon administration."
And most recently cannot excuse the failure to create more than three years after the signing of the available care simple Web pages.
I don't know whether to expect something like that.
If I had known in 18 years, that the government's power may be in conflict with the political campaigns that preceded it.
An elected office apparently does not have a predictable pattern and the opposition political party will shape our public talks and random events, such as the massacre in Newton.
But all the examples that I mentioned above, is to a large extent appear to be the result of the administration's decision.
And that worries me the most.
Obama voted again in 2012, but not because I was excited for his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented zmatečnou and nevybroušenou alternative and seemed to be able to consolidate its policy or position.
I had the feeling that a second term for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, filled with hope, of which we have heard once.
Yet it is a return to 2008 - with it, how to support Obama this week dropped by 45% - through this book increasingly difficult.
It makes me remember that a number of promises, which had vanished.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat in the primaries in Pennsylvania, with Clinton.

Syria destroyed its resources for the production of chemical weapons, the supervisory authority says
Syria destroyed vital equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, said on Thursday, the Committee for global supervision of chemical weapons, while the violent conflicts in the north of the country, near one of the places where poisonous substances are stored under the assumptions.
On Thursday, the Syrian aktivistická group also said that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons announcement came the day before 1 November
The deadline, set by the organization based in The Hague of Damascus for blocking traffic or destruction of all the equipment and machinery for the production of chemical weapons for mixing chemicals to produce a poison gas and filling munitions.
The completion of this principle in the initial phase of the destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timetable, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons by mid-2014 Damascus.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when the fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira on which experts are referred to as the seat of the factory for the production of chemical weapons storage sites, said Syrian watch for Human Rights, based in Britain.
A group of activists, who through a network of activists in Syria to monitor the total number of victims, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people died.
It is to be 61,067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the government side has to go on 29 954 of members of the armed forces of President Bashar Assad's 18,678 pro-government gunmen of the Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and 187.
Among those killed is also 2,202 government defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the organization of the United Nations has estimated that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then the number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces fought in Safiře against the rebels, many of whom are associated with Al Qaeda, for weeks.
Watch on Thursday indicated that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific figures.
The fighting underlined the dangers facing the chemical weapons inspectors, who are in their mission, which is in the middle of the ongoing civil war in Syria to get rid of the chemical arsenal, must deal with tight deadlines.
In a statement from the office of the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, was told that his team is now "satisfied that the test - and watched the destruction - Syria's declared major equipment for the production and mixing/filling."
He added that "at the present time no further control activities are planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they have completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites Damascus declared.
The inspectors said that because of concerns about safety were unable to visit two sites.
On Thursday, the office of the OPCW said, was that these two places in Syria "abandoned and... The items on the agenda of chemical weapons, which included, have been moved to two other declared seats, which has been checked.
It was not immediately clear whether the device in Safiře was one of those places, which the OPCW inspectors could visit.
Syria agreed plan complete the destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month of the Executive Committee of the OPCW.
"A tribute to the courage and bravery, demanding that you have shown in the fulfillment of this mission, what this organization ever had," said the Director of observers Ahmet Uzumcu in its commentary issued by the office of the OPCW.
Now in its third year, is standing against each other in a civil war mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad's government and security forces, which are full of members of the sect Alawitů vestiges of Shiite Islam.
As for the further development, the chief observer Ramí Abdul Rahman said that there had been a massive explosion inside the device, in the center of air defenses in Syria's coastal province Lázikíja.
He said that the cause of the explosion was not known.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria is running one of the largest European energy projects, said the director of Gazprom.
"Today we are witnessing landmark: Construction began on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline project, the largest and most important in Europe," Gazprom president Alexei Miller said in its statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the Russian export routes across Europe.
The dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings the majority of Russian gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says that a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" removed.
Once the project begins its operation in 2015, Bulgarian consumers get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline for a reduced rate.
Gazprom says that it has in other countries in the direction of flow to begin by the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Early puberty: Advanced earlier
The research showed that Afroameričanky and Hispánky are reaching puberty earlier than their Caucasian contours.
The physical changes do not mean that the approaching adolescence
It is not proven that hormones or other chemicals are behind it
Experts say one of the triggers earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend is not so evident earlier puberty for boys.
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family problems.
Should the mother zděsit, when her daughter will start to grow breasts and pubic hair at the groin at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American College of Surgeons explained this week in Orlando, Florida pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these physical changes are relatively common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time, that I am assured parents that it's not usually a sign of rapid development in the direction of a teenager," Kaplowitz said
Visible signs of development, such as the growth of their breasts, hair at the groin and armpits and body odor, the girls have previously.
For the last forty years he was, however, just a small shift in the age of the first period.
In the United States is now the average age of 12.5 years compared to age 12,75 in 1970.
"When you start to develop breasts, expire at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs," said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem" (Early puberty in girls: Essential guide to tackle this growing problem)
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue, it's time.
The debate about what makes a real start puberty, but if the breast growth is accompanied by growth spurtem before 8 year old girl is considered "prematurely mature."
In most cases the process slows or stops - which may paediatric doctors closely monitored.
Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to run tests to exclude the serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: Premature ageing bones, which can ultimately lead to a halt of growth and dwarfism in adulthood.
The recommendations are dependent on drugs and hormone treatment at the age of the child, the speed of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociologické aspects are also important.
As regards the deployment of medicines, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty may alleviate the problems with the conduct of the girl and her feelings, that is different from their peers."
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply do not want to have their very young daughters periods.
"I do worry that they may become pregnant, or how it will handle the hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," says one woman, whose daughter began to have menstrual periods in 10 years.
Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school frightened and angry, that is the first of his friends.
There are a number of well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Still, however, there is a file of evidence, that are to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media.
The boys as girls are reaching puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz promotes the assumption that the reason for this is the most serious epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 helped with the study is carried out on girls aged from 6 to 9 years, which connects with the timing of puberty of body fat.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country and Hispánky Afroameričanky tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are various.
From a global perspective, it seems that the designs of the early puberty are influenced by everything from economic conditions over the climate after the genes.
Another puzzle: Although for boys are already at a young age appears hair on the face and in the groin, a trend toward full bloom early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other doctors participating in a conference of the American Association of pediatric doctors (AAP) added more complexity to this subject.
Acne and hair groin is common even in infants and toddlers.
"We have to be careful, as to how to identify the real onset of puberty," said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey Goryebské.
Parents should not hesitate to get from your doctor's instructions on how to talk with your child.
"It may mean that we need to talk with the child sooner than you expected," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child is likely to be responding well.
The girls, who are evolving, they need the assurance that, even if it is premature, this process is a normal part of life.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
There is a decisive battle.
The Lebanese movement Hezbollah deployed 15,000 of its fighters in preparation for a decisive battle on the mountainous area north of Damascus Kalamún.
According to reports of Israel still advanced on Wednesday raids at two sites in western Syria destroyed missiles intended for Hezbollah.
The Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army.
The program is the fight against Israel, which is also in the Syrian conflict alone, but he clearly said that will prevent the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports on Wednesday of Israeli raids on the weapons caches in western Syria the only state.
Israel said the attack, but American sources have confirmed it.
According to Syria's website Dampress.com hit rockets fired from the area of the Mediterranean Sea, the Syrian missile base south of Latákíje Snúbar Džabla.
The news stations al-Arabíja claims that affected were two stores, in which the missiles were ready to transfer to Lebanon.
According to its sources were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel refused to comment on the report, but a military analyst Ron ben Yishai said that Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with rockets and Syrian Air Force teaches members of Hezbollah's armed wing to use missiles.
SA-8 missiles are outdated, that the Syrian army has since the 1980s.
They are placed on a floating chassis.
Although they are relatively primitive, mobility and small size makes it possible is easily concealed.
They are equipped with radar, but after firing missiles off, so it's hard to focus.
Latákíja lies in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling alávity.
The area is well guarded and Hezbollah has in the past involved in the fighting in western Syria.
Syria's claims that it helps to protect the Shiite community, to which alávité belongs.
It is now reportedly 15,000 of its fighters ready to help conquer the army back Kalamún.
Along with Hezbollah in the Syrian army also strengthens its troops.
Kalamún Homsem lies between Damascus and the third largest city of the country.
The battle has been under al-Arabíji resources in retaliation for the recent attack the headquarters of the opposition Syrian Shia brigade Fadla Abu Abbas in Shiite parts of Damascus.
Hezbollah this year has helped the Syrian army fought back Kusajr city near the Lebanese border.
Many of the insurgents from Kusajru went right into Kalamúnu.
He says in it, that al-Maliki has a large share of a resurgence of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is also said to be part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
For ČSSD negotiates Sobotka.
Social democracy disintegrates, PP and babišovci together and talk about a common procedure.
If the Social Democrats in a few weeks Lindstrand, sit at the negotiating table with perfectly sehranými partners, who put on the table a list of demands including ministerial posts.
The envoys ČSSD then either consume sour grapes, or nod to the capricious minority coalition government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he carried on a wave of sympathy, met for the first time.
Yesterday he failed to control the political consideration and the main force convicted liar to resign.
Confirmed negotiator for the party is so far only he, other members of the team will leave until after a crucial meeting of the Central Executive Committee (DVV).
I apologize to the members of the panel and now and citizens.
It does not lie in your personal life, or to the public.
"It was a mistake," he said after the hearing of the inner leadership Michal Hašek social democracy.
He added that, to the post of first deputyn't.
"give its decision on November 10 at DVV," said Beowulf.
As he spoke, Vice-President ČSSD Zdeněk Škromach and head of the parliamentary club Jerome Tejc.
He warned, however, that he was elected just two days before.
The two MPs have said then that they would do everything to the 50-strong club ČSSD was one voice.
Absurd theater put on a crown Michal Hašek sentence: "I am a member of ČSSD fifteen years, I have always been loyal to the brand and I respected the ruling party organs."
So another lie in live.
Or, perhaps, to call for his resignation and his withdrawal from the negotiating team forgot that in August the DVV Sobotkově 57 percent held that the party's candidate for prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka?
ČSSD DVV calling up for next Sunday, however, made a powerful army chief enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flooded e-mail 192 members of this body and the media harvest of gossip and rumors, possibly reminded of the real error Sobotkovy political career.
It will be a hard fight dirty laundry, there are indications the alliance between uhlobaronem Zdeňkem Bakalou and Sobotkovým wing.
It will discuss a friendly relationship Bohuslav Sobotka and an influential advocate Radka Pokorného.
Vybublají jihomoravské disputes or the Moravian-Silesian ČSSD organization.
Warning are the words of Mayor airport and Petra Kajnara Sobotkova ally: "I signed the Charter 77, therefore, that the country ruled this planet idiots."
If the DVV met again this weekend, liar would probably be forced to ritual sacrifice their functions.
Traitors posypou his head and ash will remain.
And at the moment the dashing boss ČSSD then end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
The UN is celebrating the new objectives of fighting poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work immediately on a new set of goals, which will replace The Millennium Development Goals, which were introduced 12 years ago for the purpose of tackling global poverty.
Before the UN summit on sustainable development, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats were playing a key role in promoting "sustainable development goals," which are to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillardové, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon overnight at the summit said that now is the time to rise above national interests."
"I am pleased that the Member States agreed to launch a takeover of the process, which is to establish the general objectives of sustainable development - the SDGs," he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress that has been made in the context of the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the development programme after 2015.
Make every effort to fulfill the mandate given to me by the Member States and implement our vision of sustainable development goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Babiš: The government only with Sobotka.
Andrei Babiš YES is beginning to accept that his movement would not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that will have to be straight to the government, to any earnings.
The president of the YES admitted in an interview that the law, which will be published tomorrow.
Putin promised green Olympics, a plan he dooms giant secret dumps
Winter sports fans already cut three feet into the opening of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their training with increasing concern.
Russian Olympics, even if it starts up in February, is facing yet another scandal.
The Russians had apparently failed to keep a promise that the preparation and the organisation of the Games in no way impede nature in Krasnodarském region in the foothills of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors head for four months.
After the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians have built the bar very high, the Canadian game wrote in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
It seems, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin's commitment to hold the games with "zero waste", took a long time ago for her.
The AP reporters last week discovered a giant landfill construction material in the village of Achštyr near Sochi.
A full dump construction material, tyres, jerry cans and insulating foam found again in August, which environmentalists immediately reported.
The Russian authorities are whoredom and landfill disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters saw eye to dump the size of three football fields.
It is not only in the area of such sites DS9|Sacrifice several, described by the British newspaper The Times.
Work at the site of the Russian Railways, the state monopoly, which is building around šedesátikilometrovou route between the airport in Sochi and sports resortem.
The company, which has swallowed 280 billion rubles, Vladimir Jakunin led one of Putin's close aides.
In August, blocked the railway that founded the dump someone of subcontractors.
The local residents but are desperate.
According to population Achštyru around the village for the past three months, day and night driving trucks full of waste material.
According to the experts, there is a risk that the waste contaminating the local river Mzymtu other streams and, ultimately, the Black Sea.
"The water here sočské contaminating water sources in the next 10 to 15 years," said the British newspaper Vladimir Kimajev of environmental NGOs EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian Organizing Committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, are one of the large tunnel, according to the opposition.
For comparison: The games in Sochi will cost $51 billion, while the summer Olympics in Beijing 2008 came to 43 billion.
Last year's Games in London were only 19 billion and the vancouverské nine billion.
But corruption scandals, project delays and concerns if, in the end, there will be enough snow is also reports that do not respect human rights at work at the exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers stitched up his mouth to protest, that didn't get paid for two months.
Many also fear, as the Russian organizers popasují during games with the new law, which prohibits the promotion of homosexuality.
Some visitors are going to Russia's support of gay men in the Olympics.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft will remain in Australia for the time being in force
The Australian airline passengers will have to remain off their tablets and smart phones during the launching and landing without regard to changes in the US for a relaxation of the rules in relation to these devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) gave space for American companies to change their practices, so passengers will be able to read electronic books, watch videos or play games on its facilities during critical phases of flight, when the device will remain in the "air" scheme.
Passengers already can do this during most of the flight, but many people poisoned, that they cannot have access to electronic books during takeoff and landing.
The Australian carrier from American carriers are exploring this decision, which requires a great deal of work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change its practice soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also examined the announcement, he said, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in the critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
"Casa currently has no specific rules regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft," he said.
The question is covered by the regulations, which require aircraft operators to ensure that security will be maintained at all times and that passengers are acting in accordance with security guidelines, which will receive from the crew members.
The company Virgin, which already with CASA talked about expanding the use of its in-flight entertainment system wi-fi, was in favour of change, but announced that it will be subjected to the decision of the regulatory authority.
"We welcome, if the CASA conducted an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that it would be now, when we have (wireless in-flight entertainment), improved customer experiences," the spokesman said.
Qantas announced that, for the time being, I will stick to the current regulations.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention to change in the near future," he said.
FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
But we are interested in the developments in the regulatory area, which can be useful for our passengers, and be sure to thoroughly study the FAA decision and the reasons are behind him.
In the case of air carriers from the US company with the impact of the rules will be different from the company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
The carriers will have to demonstrate that their planes can tolerate radio interference of mobile phones, and also to review the manuals, training materials, programs for carry-on baggage and passenger information.
"as soon as the airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, passengers can afford to use electronic devices, such as tablets, light and portable electronic readers and smart phones, at any altitude," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility crew ordered passengers to get off during landing gear.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment during take-off and descent safely stowed under the seats or in the storage space above his head.
Nonsense in the film gravity are, but the show is a beautiful, say experts
A fantastic movie from the universe of gravity vyprodával some time after the premiere of the movie in the Czech Republic.
In October saw him under the Union's film distributors almost 150,000 spectators and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews of the slide in a positive light.
Other things in it, however, is located some inconsistencies.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists on it, how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense, which appeared in the film.
Jiří Dušek (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Brno): I like science-fiction movies, which I consider to be modern, dreamlike fairy tales.
The film gravity included, even though he faces as "physically real" show.
It is not, but that does not mean that he was wrong.
I've enjoyed it very much.
See you can be Sandra Bullock's hair, which is sort of raises in microgravity.
Hubbův space telescope and the International Space Station move after significantly different orbits, therefore, cannot be seen in one frame.
Some viewers of the film about unrealistically active effect and all of the behavior of fire in weightlessness.
The suits would also hold such wounds.
The heroes in the film gravity is often come into conflict with various objects and suits without much trouble all last.
The criticism has not been spared either the plotline.
So much tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is unrealistic, according to some people.
Moreover, wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair technique.
The people on the forums arguing about the "unrealistic" behaviour ropes.
She said work, as if it was intended for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (ředitel Hvězdárny a planetária Prague): I saw him just yet on a broad canvas, but I can say unequivocally, I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a film documentary, but science- fiction.
And in this story the author has the right (almost an obligation) made the consistently reality.
"More than you mention irregularities, it struck me, as it is displayed three times the space station to downgrade the level of technology (last Chinese)."
"China will be until the end of the decade and probably will look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimir Karas (Astronomického, director of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer generated scenes are very successfully trying to leave the authors of the laws of physics, and so přírodovědně oriented audience appreciate that the various cosmic collisions and precipitation quite rightly observes the angular momentum, said the dictionary physics, also look at Earth from space is very realistic including thin skin of the atmosphere and the aurora flickering on the polar regions.
The discrepancies will surely find the details.
In addition, for example, in reading the comments I found that the preferred direction circulation of space debris in orbit seems to be turned in some scenes, than it should in fact be (from west to east).
Jiří Štěpán (Astronomického employee of the Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things you makers have adapted to their needs, but no major and blatant transgression against logic or the laws of nature in the film, I notice and in comparison with other films like the focus is to see, given that the makers depend on the credibility of the event.
Of those moments that don't make sense is worth it to the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits after otherwise inclined orbit than ISS.
The result is considerably different mutual speed and a rescue operation would therefore, in fact, could not take place as shown in the film.
Then at the moment of separation of Stone and Kowalski (Clooney) (Bullock) I noticed that all the ISS was rotating, therefore it is not even clear the origin of the force to try, which makes both players to let go of the moment is already against each other at a standstill.
Bombardier profit fell as a result of a drop in orders and deliveries
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier announced on Thursday 15% decline in net profit, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems in the drive train.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not disclose any data on air test for its new CSeries aircraft, even offering up-to-date information, as to whether the plane would comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the opening test flight about a month and a half before the plane flew only three times and appeared on the question of whether the testing phase is proceeding well.
The results have not materialized estimates, and the shares on the stock exchange in Toronto fell by 8 percent.
The State Bank analyst Cameron Doerksen declined Thursday rating from "higher returns" to "exercise sector "with the expectation that the stock market will experience a limited growth during the next quarter or two.
"while smaller aircraft deliveries are expected for the most part, the profit margin in the field of transport us greatly disappointed," Doerksen said in a report to clients.
With that, as a test program will continue, we believe, that Bombardier CSeries aircraft will get new orders.
If, however, no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect that market scepticism towards this programme will increase.
Bombardier CSeries probojují hopes that the aircraft type at the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March, after months of delay in the September held the first years.
The number of binding orders the CSeries aircraft, however, is modest 177, because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the test flight to verify the company's claim on the consumption and low savings on the cost of transport aircraft.
Currently, a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
The Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected when the first plane into commercial use will reach their goal by Bombardier 300 binding orders.
The executives also on Thursday assured analysts and the media, that the program is proceeding according to plan.
"test the plane remained on the ground for longer than expected," Beaudoin said in the conference call, and said that examination on the ground and software updates were planned during the shutdown of the aircraft.
Each manufacturer is planned to be otherwise.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the update and we did that.
It will happen during the entire flight programme.
According to Bombardier, the second of five test planes should fly in the coming weeks and the other not long after.
Analysts are still skeptical of it, that would be the first customer could begin to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims to evaluate his plan of the aircraft in service and in the coming months will provide updated information.
"this slow pace of flight tests - even though it is in accordance with the internal plan Bombardier - probably will reinforce our view that the entry into service will be postponed to the first quarter of the year 2015," Doerksen said.
Of the $172 million, or 9 cents per share, in the previous year's net profit fell in the third quarter ending September 30 Bombardier to $147 million, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover effect those currencies at the margins decreased from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters IBES system and turnover 4,56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that, compared to 57 aircraft a year before he added during the quarter just 45 aircraft.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Outstanding contracts in aviation division accounted for 30 September 32.9 billion, which is not even on 31 December.
The results were in line with our forecasts, but the low income in aviation orders and the overall state of the market failed us," Beaudoin said.
The yield fell by 13 percent to $2 billion in the aviation industry.
Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, said that revenue in the division rose almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Outstanding contracts in the transport sector amounted to 30 September 32.6 billion, which is a marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the traffic division was affected by the problems with the implementation of several contracts.
The executives said that the new projections will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of the company Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google's financial director Patrick Pichettea, fell by 8.5 percent to 4.83 USD on Thursday afternoon during trading.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and the nearest competitor Bombardier, announced on Thursday a 10% drop in quarterly profit.

The Kenyan press outraged the controversial media law
"It's terrible news and it is appropriate to ask, what Parliament prevents, simply nesmetl tomorrow to the independence of the judiciary," claimed the newspaper claiming the bill as unconstitutional.
"This law is very strict and repressive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of the Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media panel "will always be prejudiced, because it is the hand of the government" and that the restrictions on the content and advertising damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
