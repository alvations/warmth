The lack of snow in the mountains about hotel
Do not worry about just bare slopes KRKONOŠSKÉ Vlekar.
The lack of snow discourages people and from ordering ski stays in hotels, boarding house as.
It is therefore in the Giant Mountains still can get free rooms to all winter terms including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have got a big turnout at our website.
People pass through tenders shall record prices, but we are afraid of laid to order.
And if we are calling, you are now asking if we will be this year's Christmas in the snow, or to the mud, ” said the operator information portal Spindl. INFO Martin Jandura.
Who wants to New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your ideas, i would have to order to hesitate.
Those who prefer saving money and quality accommodation is with him and in the second place, he may try a few days wait.
Špindlerovští hotels we offer on New Year's Eve mostly just weekly stays.
I think i will try to give them for a while, but then they authorise and go for a shorter period.
And then you will be free room quickly lose, ” Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates still offers and vrchlabská travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in Christmas week, who had sold.
So half of the seats in our offer remains free.
That's why we have we any cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute, ” said the Director of Ingtoursu Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains may vrchlabská travel agency has to offer, too, but vacant posts is less.
Well at the disposal of the first two weeks is also in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This interest in winter stays adversely affects that in the Giant Mountains is still not snow.
If people are awaiting.
No one wants to spend the end of the year to the mountains, without the snow.
If during the week ski slopes, snowy, sold, Christmas, ” says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year's, rooms of the hotel horizon in Pec pod Sněžkou.
We are about five percent better.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we got the last couple of places.
Big interest is on the polish holiday in January and well is sold and February, ” said the Director of the best peckého hotel Karel Council.
Of the 80% is New Year's Eve stays occupied by the Hotel Omnia for central parking in Janska spa.
On the contrary, at Christmas remains in the most recent janskolázeňském even half of the hotel for free.
Pleasantly surprised us this January, which we have in this moment of occupied about sixty percent.
A little weaker is February, but as soon as the mind of snow, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains must still rises, said the hotel manager Omnia Eric Sporysch.
However, the snow on the Santa KRKONOŠSKÉ hotels we must go.
Thursday's cool, if any reductions that should be snow in the mountains.
But then again come warming, informed Jiří Jakubský from Hradec workplace of czech hydrometeorological institute.
The US is the mother of wisdom retries:
It's funny, with what a schoolboy snaživostí Barack Obama, the president with a reputation for the smartest, repeated in Afghanistan's the strategy of his predecessor, which he considered it.
When he finally sweated out his wistfully expected Afghan doctrine, it turned out that copy it over kopírák of Bush's Iraq's script three years ago.
Not only a few times in the text used word turnover as in Iraq, ” but did not hesitate even used the name of Bush's declaration of January 2007 as the name of your own declarations: “new path forward. ”
Three years ago, he criticized the Bush's idea to send fresh military reinforcements to Iraq troubled civil war as “irresponsible and in their consequences of the disastrous decision ”.
Subsequent month, however, showed that Bush's strategy based on the recommendations of field commanders, who was the only possible and veleúspěšnou so today in the intelligence sessions on Iraq, he does not speak.
Bush's reputation, but to improve it objectively left his successor more grateful default situation than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama in the hopes that miracle again.
The increase in military contingent him again asked field commanders, in particular the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, which even despite subordinačním practices zkritizoval harshly hesitant shooter in the White House.
I asked 40 thousand men, to break the situation for the better.
The president of the three months he hesitated, but nothing better to, and so at least swindled General 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe could squeeze the promise of a further 5 thousands, even though i originally calculated at least 10.
Problematic for Obama's strategy appears to be its intention to start downloading troops from Afghanistan already for 18 months and cancel this process within three years of the Obama doctrine. the whole causes provides more questions than answers.
Many doubt that half-hearted can increase the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the internecine wars of recent years, Iraq's company relatively well ordered, its leaders respect the agreement.
Afghanistan's situation is characterized by the opposite sign - can not count on anyone, and none of the non-compliance.
Wrong under these conditions are preparing the Afghan security forces accustomed to what day change gentleman, as it suits them.
Political institutions, even if they are formally based, will remain only potěmkinovou village, which will continue to rampant patriarchal stem relations.
The balance of interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the rationality of which even more complicated the Pakistan and Iran's effects.
Not even a “operational state ”, which is a minimalist objective of the entire operation, he does not look like a very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy it strikes his voluntarismem.
For the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan only deteriorated, and is now at the edge of the explosion.
Believe in that the soldiers sent to war turmoil in order to “early return home 'cause here made a miracle, it may just soul really romantic, facts intact.
From a political point of view, it is the responsibility of the date of withdrawal, the Taliban, because it will be seen as a direct award of american defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that there are Europeans' willingness to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is coming to the negative.
Europe's politicians do not know and i do not want to explain to their voters, how the safety of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the mountains Hindúkuše.
Another factor capable of radically intervene in the situation is developments around Iran.
If the situation will continue to deteriorate and reinforced sanctions on the Iranians, arises from the United States přetěžká question, whether to try to solve the problem of military force.
Respond to it, it will be necessary to just when under Obama's America shall proceed, the victorious downloading from Afghanistan.
Any such solutions, of course, will mean a dramatic turnaround in Afghanistan's situation.
Only one patch for Barack Obama is the fact that in the presidential elections have three years, and therefore there's still plenty of time to come up with another strategy, if this proves to be a total loser.
The managers of Goldman Sachs, get the remuneration in cash
Senior managers of U. S. banks Goldman Sachs get this year, the remuneration in cash.
The company announced that responds to harsh criticism of their labour practices.
A group of 30 leading managers get money instead of shares, which can be sold at least five years.
In addition, the managers of shares may be taken in the event that will be excessively risk.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Agency Reuters puts it in his forehead attempts to contact the remuneration on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is well aware of the broader the direction in which needs to issue, said the company's investment banker JPMorgan Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became criticized after for the first three quarters of this year, she gave away almost $17 billion (almost 300 billion USD) to the remuneration.
The total amount of the remuneration in the undertaking for the year according to the Agency may despite today Reuters unannounced measures exceeds 20 billion.
High remuneration in the banking sector, with the arrival of the financial crisis in a number of countries have become a political issue.
Britain in the centre of the announced that bonuses bankers exceeding 25.000 pounds (about 712.000 USD) in a single dose to the 50% of taxes.
Similar steps prepared and France.

The Minister for Janota is considering demise. Klaus's invited him to the castle
President Václav Klaus shall take on Friday morning, Finance Minister Eduard Janota, which is considering remaining in the government, because it does not match with the form of the budget for the coming year, as in the centre of the approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
It is assumed that the budget and maybe even Janotovo remain in office will be topics of their Friday's meeting.
The budget of the critic, Klaus.
It's too high deficit, which further deepening crisis of public finances.
The meeting's Radim Ochvat spokesman said.
On its next to remain in function wants Janota act on Monday with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
Under the law on the budget, now get Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should run a deficit 163 billion crowns.
But in the middle of the proposals of the left on movements of cash and increase the money to the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
The government reproached proposals of social democracy that secretly raise the budget deficit.
Between left on the one hand, and the Government of, Klaus and, on the other hand, for it was a domestic dispute, which is beginning to float question mark over the next action Fischer bureaucratic Cabinet on the formation of ODS agreed in the spring, the Social Democrats (ČSSD) and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget as the House has adopted, in essence, disposed of package austerity measures, which Fischer government in the autumn prevailed and which is under her stop borrowing State.
Klaus, which the law on the state budget may, but also have to sign for this discussion breakfast with businessmen, politicians longer neglected “serious problem ”, which is the“ sustainable deficitnost ” of public finances.
Today, he no longer has a good solution.
Improve could bring only strong government, which, moreover, could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, says the president.
The chairman of the ODS Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is scary, and the government should consider the further existence.
Deputy chairman of the Civic Democrats (ODS) ČTK, Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats (ČSSD), the Civic Democrats (ODS) and green had obviously does not work.
Prime Minister Fischer in response was similar words for “strong statements ”.
The boss ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek on Topolánek reacted words that scary's budget deficit, which the former Topolánek government prepared for this year and which exceeds 200 billion crowns.
I have identified in the center of the Social Democrats (ČSSD) approval of the budget for the following year for success.
Satisfied were also KDU-ČSL.
Mandel in news Clint Eastwood played Morgan Freeman
South Africans says that the new Hollywood movie Invictus: undefeated denounced by the world a lot about the country on its fight and victories, despite some criticism that the main role ztvárňují american actors.
Story about sports, racial proportions and Nelson Mandela.
Indefatigable warrior against racist apartheid regime in the Republic of South Africa and its first black president Nelson shock in his life story is a oscarový american actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he jednadevadesátiletý Mandela asked whether it in Eastwoodově film could she.
Another important role it plays Matt Damon.
I told him: 'if i play, i will have to have access.
72-year-old actor, which received the award for the role in Eastwoodově drama from the environment of boxing million Dollar Baby, she has, for example, the leader of the Movement for the abolition of slavery, from which will eventually become a slave, nominal US president and even God in the divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive, and it's so important for many people like Mandela.
Former South African statesman was 27 years in prison for their active job for termination of apartheid in South Africa.
To freedom was released in 1990, and for four years, then become President of the country.
In 1993 was honoured by the Nobel Prize for Peace.
Invictus is latin word for the undefeated, and it's the name of the poetry of the author of William Ernesto Henleyho issued in the year 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him

The biggest challenge, of course, was it to speak like him.
An actor, he said, that if he and the world's policies were in the same area, he tried to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be backstage before his speech.
The most important was that i wanted to Mandela shake your hand.
I have found that when my hand, i am taking your energy, transfers, and i felt that i know how you feel, he said.
It's important to me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon ztvárňuje in the film, François Pienaara, the captain of the National Rugger team, in which patients were primarily white players.
An actor said he had six months in which to prepare for his role in a hard world football.
The big surprise for him, it was when they first met Pienaarem in his house.
I remember how i rang the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing i am François Pienaarovi in his life, he said, was: 'in the film, do i look much bigger'.
Despite clear differences in characters of the actors in comparison with their real masters Eastwood, under the leadership of the director Invictus: undefeated positive reviews, and there's talk of ambitions for an Oscar.

The secret of the glow of Norway rozluštěno: the Russians were testing the rocket
Above the Norway to observe special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only last acknowledged that near the borders of the tested intercontinental ballistic missile.
Start it was but again failed and shot known as the type of “Bulava ”, which should be initially the pride of the russian army, slowly becomes black nightmare of russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests rockets had to the success of the test flights due effect.
Do not take Bulava majority or damaged in the air.
In russian newspaper of “Bulavě ” writes as“ the rocket that fly. ”
The rocket that fly but shine
This, in the order you 13. attempt was initially normally.
And at the end of the flight was again to technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the missiles.
This time, “Bulava ” starting from nuclear submarines Dmitri Donskij, which was below the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missiles, allows the firing of the vessel is in motion, and at the same time submerged.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by closer unspecified flying object, was actually broken “Bulava ”.
Indeed, the Norwegians doubted that from the first moment of russian missile.
This prevents the generals and says he can not speak clearly of failure.
The first two degrees, and an accident had lasted until the third.
In previous cases down engines in the first instance.
Even if no perfect did not take place not one test Start, for unsuccessful views of the management of the Ministry of Defence only six of the thirteen.
Almost 50% success rate therefore generals fills optimism and i still say that “Bulava ” once it will fly without problems and that even bear to ten hypersonických nuclear blocks of a maximum of the total weight of 1,15 tonnes.

Fetisov, which ended my career in 40 years in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
Then, what is he hurt Denis Kuljaš, not necessarily we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed that the team will help.

Hyundai comply with the unions will cancel all overtime.
Hyundai in Nošovice management with the union agreed on the abolition of all overtime.
It is because of the often nařizovaným overtime declared unions on Monday strike emergency.
It confirmed Hyundai spokesman Petr Vaněk.
The management shall not, however, wants to trade union leaders agree on one this year's Saturday shift.
We can not resign to our production plan, it is essential, therefore, was designed to voluntary overtime Saturday December 19, with the result that would have made two shifts, said Vaněk.

Czech discovery: a substance which works on 'hardy' viruses HIV
A team of czech and german scientists is testing the new compounds, which can slow down the spread of HIV virus in your body.
The main advantage of improved substances is that works and viruses, which has already obtained against drugs immunity.
This fact in some cases outweigh the compound on the normal variant of the virus is as strongly as some already available.
Still can not cure AIDS.
However, patients can greatly increase life combination of medicines that inhibit HIV multiplying in the body.
Their use, however, is accompanied by a series of side effects.
In addition, the incomplete suppression of the virus to multiply has resulted in the development of the so-called resistant virus against which are already medicines ineffective.
The work of experts of the three institutions of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, of the Institute of Chemical Technology Prague and from the University in Heidelberg opens the way, what's with the resistance of the virus.
Have shown that a substance called metalokarborany work to a protein responsible in the reproduction of HIV.
Metalokarborany are compounds of carbon and hydrogen, boron, cobalt.
These compounds are blocking the spread of the virus otherwise than all today used drugs, and therefore may overcome the problem of resistance.
In my work scientists are coming with the new “improved ” compounds prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metalokarborany have unique three-dimensional structure: two mnohostěnné cage consisting of atoms of boron, hydrogen and carbon atom are linked metal, in this case, the cobalt.
Treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein the HIV virus, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by the cleavage of the HIV virus would not arise mature infectious virus particles.
When we stop HIV protease, stop the spread of the virus in the patient 's body, explain the scientists in print the report issued by the Institute of organic chemistry, biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
At work, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry scientists describes a series of compounds in which they are two pairs of cages (see table) linked short organic chain which is further systematically amended.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants of hiv-infected patients.
The effect on the normal metalokarboranů variant of the enzyme is as strong as in clinically used drugs, but its effect does not waste for resistant variants which are used drugs often ineffective.
Unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications of metalokarboranů is interesting compounds for further research aimed at the proposal of active anti-hiv medicines, says Pauline Řezáčová, head of the lab structural biology of the Institute of organic chemistry, biochemistry and Institute of molecular genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The argument for the budget. ODS to Fischer, that was to prevent
The chief of the CDP Mirek Topolánek was approved by the budget for the following year for the “creepy ” and Prime Minister Jan Fischer, according to him should consider the further existence.
The ODS called Prime Minister for strong statements.
He leaves the time for analysis.
Deputy chairman of the Civic Democrats (ODS) Petr Nečas said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of the Social Democrats (ČSSD), the Civic Democrats (ODS) and of the Green Party has obviously does not work.
President of the Government by Nečas must decide whether it intends to support in the House of minority, which regards the fight with the growing deficits, or him to remain in office, with the help of parliamentary left.
Access ODS and social democracy to issue of public sector deficits is vastly different, said Nečas.
The House in the centre of the adopted a budget for the year 2010, of course, with leftist amendments for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increase the money to the salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and the direct payments to farmers.
Criticism of government at the address of the proposals of social democracy was it that secretly raise the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should run a deficit 163 billion crowns.
Before the vote Civic Democrats (ODS) left the room so wishes, comply with the government and revised budget is less bad variant than the makeshift.
Disappointment and the futility of
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and frustration, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government still assess the situation.
Nečas is convinced that if the Janota seriously threatened to leaving the function in the event of the adoption of the amendments to the situation look different.
According to czech tv's Janota ordered on Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He suggested that is considering further remain in office.
The reason for this is the disappointment of the negotiations on the budget.
If the Fischer by a for another fight with a deficit of the budget, in accordance with the Nečas in government what to do nominanti the Social Democrats (ČSSD), which changes in the budget.
Prime Minister should also right to say that, if the resignation shall be submitted by the approved by other laws deficit increases, such as those relating to health, pensions, and / or amendments to the service of the law.
Topolánek: ministers nominees ODS is guilty
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the government.
The ministers nominees ODS did not do anything wrong, emphasized the Topolánek in the text message from the US.
He reminded that on several ministries are in náměstkovských functions people hlásící to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if the Fischer decides to resign in principle the fight with the amount of the general government deficit, “it's perfectly logical and fair, that's against the left-wing majority, which currently in the House's ”.
Then i heard but can not count on support and a tolerance of civil Democrats.
I had not thought about it, and when it is the current, that's what i will pay, i told journalists in the House of Commons, Defense Minister Martin Barták, which in the government's Civic Democrats nominated.
Prime Minister Fischer afternoon flew at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister Topolánek backed
Nečas also stressed that the Civic Democrats (ODS), in the center of the House of apparently voted against an amended budget, if the Prime Minister of Civil Democrats explicitly requested that the adoption of the budget.
Seemed like orphans, we are not little children, reacted to the question of whether the CDP in political negotiations on the budget was the absence of the Chairman of the parties in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I did not notice that my voice was missing.
When i was giving up the mandate, so i knew that in the coming months will, in particular, on the bolševizaci House and the destruction of all positive reaction alone Topolánek.
According to the new order of ČD will be less trains for almost the same fare
Czech Railways from 13 December withdrawn or restricted some less busy express and lokálky, other connections, on the contrary, stronger.
Total range of transport from the date of application of the new timetable reduced compared with today by two percentage points.
Most of the tariffs, including the basic and customer fare will not change.
More options related to the capital gain, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, track to this track add one set of pendolino.
On the contrary, stops the high-speed train ride to Bratislava.
Less express rides also along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice, significantly reduces the direct connections Praha - Letohrad.
From regions are planning to track the greatest reduction of transport in Hradec Králové region, a total of eight percent, to increase, on the other hand, can look forward to Prague and its surrounding areas.
Aborting also two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice and operation of several express along the route Prague - Písek - České Budějovice is limited only to certain days a week.
The largest changes belongs to the introduction of the new direct flights from Milovice to Prague, it must milovičtí change trains in Lysá nad Labem.
It's about the fifteenth line of peri-urban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification lines of Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Remote connections to the capital city will go in the destination station Prague Main Railway Station.
ČD introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to šumperk / Jeseník will go at two-hourly intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December passengers already.
This year's account for regional rail: about 200 million more
Express orders and the Ministry of Transport, total to cover so-called demonstrable losses to the next year, four billion crowns, as well as this year. lokálky ordering the Shire, total for pay it next year eight billion crowns, with less than three billion regions will contribute to the State.
This year are regional trains on the 200 million more expensive.
I have to lokálky express the newly concluded ten years, was still the contract for one year.
The said, because the system may have reached to an increase in the prices of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only in day-old network tickets ČD Net and cheap Internet tickets eLiška.
For passengers without customer card, the price of ČD Net increase of 450 CZK 600 CZK.
Price eLišky will newly based on the distance travelled, yet he was for the journey between any regional cities of uniform and was 160 CZK.

The story of spring concerns each, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the next few days he comes to America's cinemas Nový Hollywood movie Clint Eastwood Invictus (official language name sounds Invictus: undefeated), which displays the part of the story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous warrior against apartheid, Morgan Freeman, which he had heard for their design years ago chose himself Mandela.
The male role of the legendary South Africa's champion in rugby Francoise Pienaara is he Matt Damon.
With an indication of the image to the cinema arise from the responses critics and to the public as
Nelson Mandela
Full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in South Africa, Mvezu.

The President of the Republic of South Africa was in 1994 to 1999.
High expectations, as it comes at a time when the public concerned in the Republic of South Africa, on the other hand, culminates in the preparation of the World Championships in football, but at the same time, the media with alarming reports on the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the population of the black of the ruling of the majority.
According to the intelligence agencies AP are response to a new movie in JAR for the time being generally positive, despite many objections to cast the main role “profláklými ” Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is nevertheless, according to their words for a new movie proud.
I have been dreaming about the role for years, and i looked at her.
Many times i have also personally with Nelson Mandela, so - what do you call - replenish your his energy, said in an interview for the gala premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's all right, if we can film recalled Mandela personality and the message.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but applies to everyone, he added.
In the uniform of a national football team
Slide based on book the draft of the british writer John Carla's with loosely translated name in the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela, and the game, which gave rise to the nation portrait of the south african human rights defenders during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, therefore, in the course of the film trying to together two racial and for many years vymezované groups of the population and to each other as well as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, shall he, too, in acting role in the South African National rugbyovém uniform on to the pitch the World Cup, which then JAR won.
For entry on the grass in the uniform, which is in the JAR understood almost like something sacred, harvest Mandela 14 years ago a great ovation predominantly white audience and obtained a recognition of the white population.
Football championship perhaps people rejoin in one nation, the rugby player Chester Williams, who was in 1995, the only “black ” in the national team.
Whether the tense situation in JAR better, just show up.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as for example in a recent interview for LN told fan rugby Christopher Dawson, who from the country escaped to Britain.

Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci from January down set in his habits.
As the first for family should be free of charge and, at the same time, optional.
It's voice, but it would be compulsory vaccination of more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the unpaid vaccination against pneumococci peaks.
It lays down the maximum prices drug Institute of vaccines, which pay health insurance companies.
Experts have also have a clear in the procedure at the time of vaccination.
New series
The vaccine, free of charge for the August children
From January may be free of charge vaccinated against pneumococci children born last 2 August and later.
The precondition is that it does not come even one dose of vaccine.
Who began to vaccinate last year or earlier, he must pay for himself and other booster vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last voluntarily left their children to vaccinate against pneumococci a quarter of the families.
Parents yet paid 1600 crowns for one dose and more.
At the time of vaccination, the youngest children are need four doses.
Experts estimate that the overall health insurance undertaking shall issue to the vaccine dose of 300 to 450 CZK 1,000.
Save it for the treatment of which the children without vaccination needed.
Still worth all the vaccination of children was approximately 500 grand a year.
Vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janotovým package.
The pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including brain fever and blood poisoning.
To pneumococcal infections with us for the year will die under investigation in hospitals to 28 children up to 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic introduced by the vaccination of children against pneumococci around in 40 countries.
The vaccination will be required?
At the same time, but there the views in the future could be this vaccination required.
From January to be borne by the insurance undertakings and optional.
That would be compulsory vaccination better, for example, head of the civic association loud Rudolf Kalovský.
Its association pneumococcal vaccine in promoting.
Experts on the International Conference on which our associations participated in, they were completely satisfied with that we have a voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have managed to push through at least this.
I think that's the way we have to get in, said Kalovský.
Ministry of Health, but the vaccination against pneumococci change does not want to.
At this moment about it at all, said his spokesperson Vlastimil hornet.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, says doctors
The President of the practical paediatric doctors Hana Cabrnochová recognises that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If they have been vaccinated all the kids could be considered to reduce the number of a booster vaccination with the “in a situation where the vaccine is so high amount, quite understand political decisions that vaccination was off as a voluntary, ” says, of course, Cabrnochová.
Experts expected that their infants to vaccinate against pneumococci from next year more than 80 percent of fresh parents.
Vaccination against pneumococci's breakthrough in that it as the first area of vaccination of children shall be borne by the health insurance companies, no State.
Insurance companies should make money on prevention, save it for the next treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Your doctor will have to buy the substance alone
With that but is worried about practical children's doctors, which relate to the shopping vaccines.
According to the original intention of the purchase of an insurance undertaking and doctors should be received, as they become available in other vaccinations.
Some members but feared that could thus insurance “stressing the money from the health insurance ”.
Your doctor will therefore have to substances to buy and wait for them is an insurance paid.
According to estimates are individual practical paediatric doctor to invest in vaccines 40 grand a month, which is significant sum.
It will not be that simple, says Cabrnochová.
Still they and we
It may be a Muslim Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in secular state.
At a time when the swiss voters called for the construction of minarets and, in general, spread the news of the alleged Islamization Europe, John Bowen, american academic wrote and informed and contemplated if may be Muslims integrate - and whether it is integrated into one of the open secular society continent.
Some of the readers, after reading this book became admirers Artist's last works, “why the French do not like scarves on his head ” (2006), this elegant and discussed the study on disputed that share issues and employ the country for a period of 15 years and whose effects are still felt even today.
The last book Mr. Bowen has a broader and more ambitious shot.
Like a good anthropologist wants to know just what politicians and media said of Islam in France, but what had actually happened in the base.
I spent months in mosques, universities and institutes which are currently care of 5 6 million french Muslims, which Mr. Bowen called “islamic areas ”.
It's a good listener, reproduces the debate between the teachers and students on issues, which is the most.
There should be a Muslim enter into matrimony in the mosque or at City Hall (or in both places)?
He should be young Muslims taught on the development and gay?
It may be a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
He has a right to use zájmově oriented the banking system, if it wants to obtain a mortgage loan?
It's such a seemingly mundane issues to be discussed, and which are part of everyday life, rather than political dramas, which employ media.
Author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers, educators and intellectuals, among other generally known persons, including Tarika Ramadana, Arab Muslim explorer and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is attempting to open discussion about how can be at the same time be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not have arguments for all their custom.
The actual idei conservatives are suspicious of the french or the European Islam.
Philosophers and activists that Mr. Bowen do an interview, to doměnce that this is the opposite Selafiho - supporters purists Sunni Islam, combined in Saudi Arabia - this group is a small, but affects the european Muslims.
Mr. Bowen considers that Muslim value and the french secularism are compatible.
But the adaptation of requires compromises on both sides.
Wonders how far are the french politicians (and intellectual elite that so obstinately lay defends the public) actually committed to the idea of pluralism.
Is of the opinion that Muslims are likely to be less experience in matters of religion, than the Catholics and Protestants and jews who also had to make historic compromise the secular Republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism found “tightening screws values. ”
It may be a Muslim Frenchman? after reading this book can anyone have a tendency to say “yes, but not now. ”
Bleak prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing dramatically more quickly than the rest of the environment of the planet.
Border the ice is melting the alarming speed, which affects the animals, and their survival as anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural resources of water, together with the diplomats, lawyers and writer in their wake.
In the book “on thin ice ” Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, they are going after the natural history of the icons to the north, a polar bear.
Familiar with complicated history and the procedures velrybářství describes a long tradition of polar explorers, who tried to seize the white bear.
Nelson's meeting with bold 14-year-old boy who fought with only kolbou muskets really is a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears who swam in the bodies of their just killed mothers were catch and sent to the zoo and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20 th century was suddenly in a circus tent 75 polar bears.
Even now the corral in a zoo are typically area of a million times smaller than the area available adults in the wilderness. climate is rarely appropriate: the resident Polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae hairs growing within the hollow of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that the hunters threatens the survival of the species.
Even when hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where the hunting of the helicopters and Indians on skis, and they are all armed with the attack guns, which odstřelují his prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water to the north of these two fishing nations and that ice will eventually be the largest.
In my new book “across the ice ” Alun Anderson, a former editor of the New Scientist, offers clear and plight responsibility of science in the Arctic and engaging a cursory glance at it as it may, the future of the change.
Not at all, scientists have answers.
Or meteorology and oceanographer do not have an adequate response to the rate changes.
Not for lack of tests.
Research the way Fridtjofa Nansena at the end of the 19 th and early 20 th century, is indicated for the first time, as the movement of flying ice.
Then the sub in the Cold War posouvající mapped to divide, when it is podplouvaly.
Satellite reconnaissance and extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful complementary, but many are still held thanks fearless individuals, bivouacked in winter.
Mr. Anderson looking into an extremely fragile world catchment systémuu Keep inside Arctic ice, stékáním of salt water, which is in the freezing point contracts.
But from výse referred to the bear to microscopic wonders uvnitž, all this is doomed to extinction, as soon as he moves summer ice, which was ever happen between the year 2013 and 2050.

The american government the supplier trapped cuban government officials
The cuban government imprisoned the U. S. government supplier which imported mobile phones and laptop computers to the country, as reported by officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Saturday.
A supplier who has not been identified yet, he worked for the company Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company operates on projects for the U. S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.

Certain charges, but has not been published in accordance with Cuba's rights may be a cuban citizen or the stranger imprisoned for almost anything, what is marked as “dangerous ”.
All the so-called kontrarevolucionářské activities, including mild protests and critical Stati, give rise to the risk of imprisonment.
An anti-government graffiti and talk is considered to be of serious offences.
In Cuba, there is a young blogující community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchezovou, which often written about how she and her husband, monitored and bother government agents.
Mrs. Sánchezová repeatedly asked permission to leave the country, in order to take the prices, but her permission was denied.
The detention of the U. S. the supplier may be due to increasing tensions between the communist Castro's brother, the ruling in Cuba, and Obama's administration, which was examined as “a delaying tactic ” in improving relations with the island.
As the first submit a report on the imprisonment of the New York Times, Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the cuban government will take concrete steps, such as, for example, the release of political prisoners and create more space for opposition, the United States shall take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed to Cuba, although they are new and a popular commodities in the country where the average wage of government employees shall be 15 dollars a month.
The cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones in this year; these are used by the majority prpo sending messages, because textovýchg 15-minute phone call would cost more than one day's wages.
The use of the Internet on the island is mimořádn limited.

Mrs. Berbenová said that can not provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which would in any other open society were legal - let's say free mobile phones - are in Cuba a criminal offence, Miguel said Vivanco, director of the U. S. program groups for the observance of human rights, which recently published a negative report on the freedoms in Cuba, entitled “New Castro, the same Cuba, ” as a reference to install Raul Castro as the leader of a country and compensation for sick older brother, Fidel.
Vivanco stated that the defendants are often arrested, tried, and trapped in one day.
He said that all the solution would be rather political and that the cuban government often baiting negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading for more extensive dialogue.
Pakistani government officials rozkrývají conspiracy, relating to the transmission of men in Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the leader of the conspiracy, relating to the secondment of the five men of Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill members of US troops, and said that they hope that this case could help to uncover an extensive network of recruiter terrorists, spying on the Internet and finds radicalized young men.
Investigators said they searched for grey rebel personality, known as the Saifulláh, which he invited these men to Pakistan after first appeared, when one of these men, comment, the authorising terristické attacks Ma Internet videostránce YouTube.
Saifilláh took charge of the management of these men, as soon as they came to Pakistan, he tried to help them get to remote areas Pakistan in the indigenous strains of Pakistan, which is home to al Qaeda and its camps for the training of terrorists.
But Pakistani intelligence officer, who has submitted a report on the case, said that on a Saturday, Saifulláh was unsuccessful in usvědčování commanders al Qaeda, and that the men were part of trying the CIA to infiltration into the terrorist network.
As a result, they were discontinued after a few days into the East Side Sarghody formidable, far away from the mountains to the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered strike unit.
Why were, said the official who spoke of anonymity in view of the sensitivity of the case.
The official stated that the men were and still tried to obtain approval to gain access to the camps al Qaeda, when they were arrested by the power of Pakistani law.
Case this five - which remained in Pakistan and was questioned náborářů FBI - underlines the critical role in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, which is much more important, determine who is not trusted.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the U. S. intelligence attributed the highest priority attempts at the location of the human resources to Al Qaeda.
Náboráři organisations operate as guards, vyřazující those who are not sufficiently serious in its commitment to a holy war and you, who could be spies.
American false recruits were subjected to al Qaeda special examination, analysts.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group, since due to their potential access to american objectives and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, older analyst at the Foundation NEFA based in the US, said that the terrorist group is also becoming significantly more careful in recent years, kohu to came up to them, because the U. S. intelligence agency, to obtain the experts on their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to break into the following groups, there is a better way than to follow their recruitment model, which was already so much monitored? said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those, which is far more based on the Web.
Tens of thousands of protest in Copenhagen, demanded climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets, this Saturday and require stronger action on climate from negotiators in the Congress Centre Bella.
The protesters reported by the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in this event, but the police odnaduje that number was closer to 25,000.
Event was relatively calm and a handful of masked activists put a few small bombs near of the group of government buildings in the center of town.
In the day that there occurred a minor incident in talks about climate, which sponsored the UN, thousands of activists passed through the city, and bore signs with english inscriptions, “this is the planet B ” (i. e. the second-rank) and one in španěltštině, who said“ country says' enough. '”
Protest participated in several celebrities, including the danish models and photographer Helena Christensenové, which stated that leave the birthplace of his mother in Peru and gave me information about the desolate state in the country where the impact of climate change, which still occur.
That's a reason why we decided to connect to this great march - through the world and the appeal to the leaders of the world, to submit a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, can not you still avoid.
The police prevent protesters, to be closer to the center of the Bella and said that held 19 persons, in the first place, because either should be deployed a mask or in a pocket knife.
These activities are under danish law during demonstrations disabled.
According to one of the spectators, who does not wish to be identified, because it is involved in rohovorů on climate, activists camouflage as athletes and in black suits laid a few bombs Copenhagen near the main channel, which is located near the several ministries.
Agitovali buildings, he said, zahajivali flares, but followed by a “several large explosion. ”
Inside the Congress Centre, people gathered around to watch the television screens, during the afternoon.
But protest probably penetrated into the consciousness of key officials, such as, for example, Su Weie, the chinese negotiators on climate.
When he was asked whether he had a positive impact on the demonstration of international negotiations, said the english “Actually, that is something that i was not aware of ” (actually it's something you have to realize).
Then he went on in čínčtině and said, “because the scene is extensive, i can not hear what's happening outside. ”
He followed, whether the march of pain or helpful depending on the prospects of each.
You can see the concentration of the general public and the various sectors and the subject matter of climate change, he said.
In other words: “can also say that this is a distortion of the negotiations or freedom of other persons.
Date of test revealed a persistent racial differences
Federal certificate from last week on the knowledge of the mathematics of it was a welcome element of the good news about the public education District of Columbia.
Even if the precinct far lagging behind the high executive systems of the country, the certificate shown greater progress for pupils fourth and classes in the last two years than in the cities, including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the last numbers of the National atestačního Centre for progress in classes are persistent differences in the knowledge between afroameričany and white students and both after the page after page of local and national.
The average result of white pupils fourth classes District of Columbia for the last two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but in their african-american peers nrůstu occurred only by three points of 209 to 212.
The difference in the knowledge is actually increased between the years 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 57 points.
Progress on the African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with the diversion of statistically insignificant one point of 245 at 245.
The average result of the white pupils was not included in the results of the test, because the size of the sample was not big enough.
The image in the six years was not encouraging.
The difference between the white and black pupils of the fourth classes in 2003, when the first NAEP has been made in the precinct, was 60 points scale (262 to 202).
Even if the result in children from oboiu groups during this period, the difference was hardly approached 58.
Some of the defenders of education in the district in the last week of expressed that the results of the celebrated, Michelle, and a secretary. Rheeovou and the mayor Adrian M. Fentym (D) were in white students extensively stimulated where there were already high results.
It is suggested that we have increased the sum of aid at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of the D. C. Voice, non-profit-making group, which argues for equality vdělávání in the precinct.
Jump up and down for the diffusion of two or three points, she said, member of the Committee of the D. C., Kwame R. Brown (D - AT Large), which has a daughter in the fourth grade primary school in Eaton.
Often criticized the style of management of Mrs. Rheeové, Mrs Brown said that a report on the results of the test means secondary education in the town is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It is clear that always want to see the virtues and i respect that.
But what's a dreadful that we paid almost no time and energy, which was the need to pay our central education.
Mrs. Rheeová said that to the precinct is continuing in search of better ways, geared to the needs of the students with low results.
Thus, for example, are some of the teachers trained in the use of new curriculum is read, Wilson system reading, aimed at students of the higher grades of basic schools and high school students, who could not handle the foundations of reading before in his kolní kariéřea significantly behind those kids his age.
The daily mathematics and the outline of teaching math in the sixth grade, stressing the games and experience of real life that entered into the precinct in the former Director Clifford Janeyiho is attributable to the progress NAEP, which has been the subject of a report last week.
And just think that we should continue to work and to carry out the best interventions in those students who remain below the level of the class, Mrs. Rheeová.
Others argued that the results of the NAEP clarify the question as to whether a Mrs. Rheeová may continue to svyšování of the overall performance of the system and still provide more money and the means for school with low performance, which is necessary for the reduction of the difference.
It's a definite dilemma Mrs Michell Rheeové, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley where he majors in the results of the tests in urban areas.
Conventional procedure axles is to focus resources and administrative reform at the school, located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
So may focus bring political repercussions which head against the relevant agenda.
But rebuke, however, include the other city managers who is trying to maintain a high prúměr between white and black.
We have to focus on the establishment of a system of large schools.
We got ta of union affinity of our schools, so that all the family, regardless of where they live, could be assured that their children will be granted an excellent public schooling.
Mr. Janey, now director of the schools in Newark, said in an interview that this week, an essential element of the reduction of the difference between the results achieved is an extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district that took part in the justification of the Schools.
You have to get up to 200 days, to be able to impose changes, said Mr. Janey, which has entered into a contract with its associations of teachers last school year in the length of 185 days, which it considers “flag ” to search for a larger increase in the next year.

In fact, a fifth of this “duhé generation ” of the spanish pupils from college - remarkable achieved results indicate that many of their imigrantských parents, most Mexicans and Central America, they got to the United States, without finished high school.
Their story of success is important, given researchers, because it underlines the point the way forward for a generation that has played a marginal role in the field of the labour force of the country.
You, who have reached the achieved higher education say that we had a natural náklonpost to the school and congenital assertiveness and efforts to succeed.
Many also had parents who set their children high objectives and looking for ways to replace the ignorance of the american education.
But the school programmes also play a special role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would like to have track - especially if these efforts in time persists.
When given to children pocházeji of low-income groups whose parents do not have experience and ability to help them norientovat in the system, any free of intervention in each individual item that will not solve, says Patricia Gándara, fellow at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the latin american area.
We have to think about it, to provide these children of reference network in preschool age in all ways to pročšly high school.
Federal programme to fund Graciely trip on the rails, is a useful example.
Known as GEAR at Palacký University (připtravit), provides more than 300 million dollars a year for the local school systems for starting college preparatory programmes, which from for students of the groups with small income to schools and continue until the following students to high school.
Since 1999, this programme will serve more than 10 million students, of which more than% entered the house, according to the U. S. Department of Education.

Safety concerns, highlighted massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the download of the U. S. Army is likely to discourage the U. S. companies from a much more intensive business in Iraq, which has shown the third largest Commodity Reserves, analysts say.
U. S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage, in particular, the chinese and other governments controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk, because they are accountable to shareholders.
Company Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc., the only U. S. companies, which have entered into agreements with the Ministry.
The U. S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips which maintain close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of the oil industry and to offer technical assistance in recent years, had gone empty-handed.

He said that he wanted to report of the UN.
The Secretary General Ban Ki - the moon now said he needed time to find a refund.
Like i said, it is high time to look after successor Eide, he said.
When i came here, there was a vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to officials of the UN Ban began searching for refunds.
Officials said they will be decided between Staffanem di Misturou who has švédsko - italian origin and previously led the United Nations Mission in Baghdad, and Jean - Maria Guéhennem, a Frenchman, who led the UN peacekeeping operations.

Gates: Iran is facing other sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers soon impose on Iran “significant additional penalties ” because of a lack of involvement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to the group about 300 U. S. soldiers in northern Iraq during the week the following areas, where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, down the prospects of military action against the Islamic Republic.
It's not a good choice for Iran, said in response to the questions of a soldier on the likely development of Keep.
One of the things which depends on me, is that if i learnt about something from Iraq in the last six years, [this] is an unpredictability in the war.
The Obama administration shall act in a package of sanctions, which could intervene iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions may also affect the ordinary Iranians.
He said, “the package scheme of incentives and barriers ” would require“ to iranian forced the government to actually feel less safe with nuclear weapons, ” because “its inhabitants will be extremely suffer ” sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion, which has issued a White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, administration engaged european leader in warning that Iran will be borne by the serious consequences, if not its nuclear program in full compliance with the Committee of the United Nations for nuclear safety and its supervisory authority, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that wants to develop their expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In the talks in Geneva 1 October indicated that wants to go back to the talks on the reduction of its nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial proportion of its stocks enriched uranium in exchange for an urgent need for the fuel for the reactor to the implementation of the medical research.
The administration shall be planted for such an agreement as a way to restore confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran withdraws from the interim agreements - partly because the expert, because irámské leadership is divided views on whether to engage in the United States.
Frankly, as regards the iranian obstinacy against the international community, in the case of certain proposals, which was agreed at the beginning of October, i think that it brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together on the path that is not on the terminology of additional sanctions against Iranians, said the Gates.
President Obama made on 31 December deadline for Iran to answer on proposals before the returns to the search for other elections, including monitoring, which US Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrades sanctions ”.
In its opinion, issued in New York, iranian mission at the UN condemned the Thursday what she called “groundless and unsubstantiated allegations ” from some members of the Security Committee on iranian nuclear activities, and said that he wants to continue the talks with the United States and five other world powers“ due to an adequate long-term solutions.
Gates, who had returned to Washington, D. C., last Friday, he met in the morning with the Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki before he left for the area of Kurdistan, rich in oil, to meet with troops in Kirkuku and kurdish leaders in Irbilu.
There remains high tension between the Kurds and the iraqi Arab majority, in particular because of the border, proprietary rights and the distribution of income.
Gtes insisted on both sides, to reduce the potential for conflict, the US plans to zabránlo presence on restrictions on the number of american troops from 115 000 to 50 000 until the end of August.
He is also trying to dampen the Kurdish concern of persistent depression. official places the US cited Gates when told Massoudu Barzáanímu, President kurdistánské regional governments: “we want to help protect your security, prosperity, and autonomiji in the Iraq.
We do not want to leave you. ”
In an ageing China, change course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters on which read that “Mother Earth is too exhausted to a more children ” and“ one child, ” means one of the grave.
Then they got a lesson that if official government jobs in Shanghai, alarmována low birth rates and the ageing of the population in their city, suddenly changed course in this summer and began to encourage young couples, their response was immediate and determined: never.
We have always spent all their time and energy just one child.
We have nothing left for the second, says Wang, 31 years, the human resources, which has 8měsíčního son.
More than 30 years of policy China have only one child was introduced and thereby create two generations only notoriously plump and spoiled children, afektovaně “little emperors ”, the country threatens the population crisis.
Average fertility rates declined to 1.8 child to a couple in comparison with six than vpolitika vsoupila in force, according to the data of the UN.
The distribution of the population, where the number of people aged 60 years and above, predicts that uproariously grow from 16.7 percent of the population in the year 2020 to 31,1% in 2050. that's far above the overall diameter of about 20 percent.
Imbalance is more rich coastal cities with populations with tertiary education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 years and above were almost 22 percent in Shanghai registered population, while the birth rate has been less than one child to a few.
Xie Lingli Shanghai, director of the city of the Commission for the stock and planning of the family said, many couples must have children, “to help reduce the proportion of an ageing population and reduction of staff working in the future. ”
He says that it's the “be old, that does not mean to be rich - as in developed countries such as Japan or Sweden. ”
The gradual uklidňování
How has been inserted into the Constitution of the country in 1978, China's one-child policy is probably still controversial mandate, established under the rule of the Communist Party.
A pair of which infringed policy, faced an immense fines - up to three times their annual salary in certain areas - and discrimination in the job.
The chinese official space for a policy that helped Earth to prevent the critical of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned to promote policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women at the second child to submit to an abortion.
In addition, many couples have to undergo sexisticky selective abortion, leading to an unnaturally high proportion of men against women.
In recent years, population officials were progressively milder in its opinion on the politics of one child.
In 2004, as a general rule, to výce exceptions - including urban populations, members of National Minorities and in cases where a man and a woman were only child - and in the year 2007 mitigate diction their passwords for the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of population research Beijing University, he said that officials of the central government has previously debated the radical changes, such as to enable couples to have two children, if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Šanghai became the first chinese city that triggered an aggressive campaign for incitement to multiple births.
Almost overnight, posters, nabádající parents to have only one child, and replaced with a copy of the regulation, describing in detail as to how it would be entitled to have a second child, and how to apply for an authorisation.
Urban management sent officials for the planning of families and volunteers to be met with by means of steam in their houses and leaflets under the door.
Promised also provide emotional and financial advice for those which have decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, officials for planning families.
Zarmucující response
Although officials in one country town in the vicinity of Shanghai experienced an increase in interest in pairs, which they wish to have a second child after the beginning of the campaign, the majority of city districts report changes.
Urban district Huinan with populations 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign is the number of births in town in 2010 still expected only around 165 000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in the year 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Committee for the planning of families in Shanghai čtvti Caolu stated that the financial considerations may have been the main reason why people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide the best first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27 years, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years, she said she would like to have two children, and they were not legally allowed to.
But like many Chinese, who have only insufficient health and life insurance provided by the Government.
Without dociální network of reference could be the choice of irresponsible.
The people in the West, assess one-child policy as a matter of dispute legal question wrong, says Yang, structural engineer, whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in volume with the first child.
Yes, we have been deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples reported psychological reasons hesitation.
Wang, human resources, says that want only one child, because she was an only child, “we were the center of the attention of our families, and all about us.
We have not been used for the provision of care and, in fact, we did not want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42 years old, who own translation company, expressed it, much nepokrytěji.
For dvoukariérové parents of the middle class, who reduced fertility rates, he said, be successful means to be selfish.
Today's 20 and 30-year waxing consult your parents as to probíjející is the first days číského experiment with capitalism, and they do not want this kind of živita for himself, he says.
Just one child, the enormous requirements at the time of parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice of at least two years of your social life.
Then there are issues propstoru - “you have to rebuild your apartment ” - and the strategy -“ you must have a summary prepared at the time when the child 9 months for a good pre-school education.
Most of his friends to content myself with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher živitními standards, he says.
We do not want to make too many victims.
The group of the UN outlined plan for the reduction of emissions.
Sponsored by the United Nations Conference on climate characterised by dalekosáhle disciplined position and mutual slander - again on Friday, focused on to the release of the document, which proposes an ambitious reduction of greenhouse gases in the next 40 years with industrialised countries, most of the load in the immediate term.
The text that can provide a basis for the final political agreement on the control of greenhouse gases, stresses the remaining barriers to the as well as brightens the way forward.
But there was an important progress in negotiations, which took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders who arrive to Copenhagen next week.
Set up ad hoc working group of the UN, the text indicates how much money he should rich countries to provide the poor to deal with global warming in the short term and long term.
And provides a whole range of choices for the key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies in order to reduce their output of carbon and what should be the upper limit for the increase in global temperature, which will be political leaders still able to tolerate.
It dodábá process a large amount of flexibility, says John Coequyt, the High Representative of the Washington club Sierra.
Michael Zammit Cutajar which has proposed a šestistránkový document, abridgement of 180 pages of text from the negotiations to focus on what peak officer on the questions of the climate in the UN, Yva de Boer, described as “the big picture. ”
Outlines the outline of the for possible agreement, in which could industrial nations together to reduce their emissions to the year at 25 to 45% compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries are likely to its emissions during this period should be reduced to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, the country to reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95%.
The European Union discussed rapidly on Friday, promise to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adopt adaptation to climate change - from the management of floods and droughts to prevent deforestation.
Still but Friday said the same sort of verbal fireworks which prevailed in talks in the last week.
Special envoy of the US for questions climate Todd Stern rejected the speech, requesting binding the limitation of the emission of greenhouse gases for industrial countries in comparison with the voluntary for major emerging economies, where they would not be financed by the developed world.
Offset signaled that the Obama administration a hard line against China go Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States to the Treaty without transfer of the developing countries and the implementation of actions, said Stern, who was also said that the text is not sufficient to ensure the restrictions and should be examined outside observer.
Stern made this comment an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister he told the U. S. Yafei climate negotiators on issues that either the lack of “common sense ” or“ exceptional irresponsibility ” led earlier in the week to the statement that the United States would help financially China to deal with global warming.
With the future economic track on the world's major powers have erupted bickering at stake, both within and between the developing world, industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fighting is mostly on the conservation of individual economies, rather than on the conservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the implementation of their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two of the most influential countries of the world they ignore strong scientific imperative for the implementation of the action.
Ricardo Ulate, delegate Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the major powers are fighting about who should bear the costs of the omezováníí greenhouse gases, while a vulnerable country have become much more aggressive in search of the Order to prevent large issuers responsibly in their actions.
This is clearly the game of that new economic hegemony is developing, he said Ulate, which also serves as a regional experts in the field of regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international protection of nature.
Some of the countries that are most zranitelnelné effects of climate change indicated that they wish to continue in promoting a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, however, most of the main participants said that the best outcome of negotiations will be the political agreement.
The Alliance small island states to 43 members, has created a draft agreement 24stránkový last Friday morning.
Arthur Runge - Metzger leading international negotiations on climate in favour of the European Commission, said that the enforcement of the small island nations “incited political tlkak on the whole polirtický process ” in part because they are now unified and require action from growing economies, such as China and India.
Negotiations led to a new urgency, as soon as the delegates focused on the fact that must resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government fight on the deal.
Senior officials, such as India's Minister for the protection of the environment Jairam Rameš and chinese Deputy Minister of stepped out of the aircraft and through the halls Bella to the closed door of meetings and conferences so they could to chart a new claims, which will be assessed next week.
Total rozsáhlost Assembly - when 13,000 people move every day to and from the Congress Centre, guitars playing activists staging at night ironizující spectacle of countries, which considered that is sent, and were on the transmission of proposals from hand to hand on a piece of paper, rather than by electronic mail - controlled by the challenge.
The intensity is only extension: in Copenhagen were present almost all of the key ministers and before in the center of the 60 heads of state.
We have reached the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodrigues, said the Deputy Minister for global policy for international protection of nature.
Here come the heavy weight.
The british the first train with speed 140 miles per hour redefine this Monday feelings
In 5: 13 Monday morning whistle cut through the darkness on the departure of the train, which meant the revolution transport in Britain.
The first passenger high-speed train in the country reaches the speed 140 miles per hour and he will fly from Ashford in Kent in the London St Pancras and overcomes distance 58 million in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs Kelly Holmes and joined the first passenger high-speed trains out of lLndýn.
Hopes that the new service, where appropriate, to combine Britain with international networks rapid, reliable trains and to combine velke agglomerations Midland, north and Scots with London.
Neglected of stagnant water should be shortened transport times in passenger traffic and trade lanes and the transition from aircraft and cars on the rail to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate the traffic on the road.
In theory, the three main political parties to obtain for this vision.
But the tens of bilinů pounds, necessary for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about the distortion of the environment now slow the building of the high-speed lines.
High Speed two (HS2), the company established in January to provide the government realisable study, submitted its report to the Lord Adonis 30 December, how the Times.
Give him a detailed map of the routes of the next stage of the planned High Speed Network.
The new trace concentration of London's West Midland has been designed to five feet in urban areas and neighbourhoods where dopat on the propstředí could be problematic.
In open country was scheduled to 25 m final routes.
HS2 also envisages the three options for extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis reply in the spring.
The preferred option is konfikurace shape (y, when one high speed should lead to West Midland.
The track should be split up near the Birmingham with one arm, passing through the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Each line should lead to Scotland.
“It looks like an efficient choice, ” he said, and expert railways.
As soon as it's done, driving times between London and Edinburgh shall be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not be opened before the year 2025, could enable passengers to travel between London and Birmingham 49 minutes compared with more than one hour in the present.
Proposals should enable trains to travel at a rate of 2 250 miles per hour, which would make on the british network the fastest in Europe.
The starting line is already proposed to kidnapped trains in length 400 m, which would have been able to carry 1100 people.
To 18 combinations could operate every hour on the route London - Birmingham.
This means that the London Terminal would be able to handle, in the case of the needs of up to 20 000 passengers in an hour.
In relation to capital restrictions, it is foreseen that the existing station would have spread so that pojmula high-speed network.
Experts from the železničníhoprůmyslu argue that only San Pancras International or the Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis shall notify whether or not to implement this scheme, but a wide-ranging public consultation and procedures for planning, means that the final decision does not keč before the general elections.
Even if the wheels in motion, the network should build up for parts.
Trains should first be put into service no on the high-speed lines, but already existing lines, north of the Birmingham and maintain the journey times between London and Scotland over three hours.
It's considered critical point of contact for the purpose of ensuring the transition from the aircraft to the trains, reference point for the revolution of the rail.

It is clear that the date of the renewal of the planned tour 8 January (at Amiens, footnote red.) seems too close, he said Camus.
Associations UDF increases the tone, and calls on the side of the Nouveau Centre to continued to enjoy their shortcut.
Associations UDF, controlled aside MoDemFrançoise Bayrou, Friday responded to attempt the president of the parties Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin misappropriation of the abbreviation of the former Giscardovy parties, with the result that the abbreviation must not be used in any medium under the threat of a criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to appropriate the shortcut UDF with it, François Bayrou not bear her inheritance after his hand left.
Secretary of Defense, whose side is a partner UMP, had planned this strategy to confirm the Saturday before the National Council movement Nouveau Centre (NC).
This his step has received support from members Hervé de Charetta (former for - UMP now for non-domain NC '), which are attributed to the ownership of the UDF, because it was the first left in 2004 register in the National Institute of Industrial Property (l Institut national de la intellectual policy).
But on a Friday night, the association of UDF controlled friends François Bayrou, who do not intend to let expropriating, stepped out of his silence, and handed a formal application of the members to stop using the shortcut and they handed back the ownership of the trade mark, under the threat of a criminal prosecution.
In the last few days you increase disturbing a declaration that suggest a political movement + again take + shortcut UDF, writes associations in its letter of 24 19 you signed by the members of the Committee, of which, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the modem or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance centriste.
At the same time you are considered appropriate place on its promotional materials and on the internet site of welcome your movements name + Nouveau Centre +, the slogan + UDF today +, state also signatories to the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this shortcut, explains the Committee UDF, which calls for movement NC “immediately to remove all references names UDF from all promotional materials including (his) of web pages ”.
At the same time asking Hervé de Charettea “to property owners of legitimate trade mark ”.
If not, turn the courts to be respected by the law, and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, drawn by the signatories.
In its letter indicate that UDF “is full of political hnutíod 1978 ” and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends“ chosen ” dismissed in 2007, “in order to create a competitive movement, as others in 2002 to founded UMP.
Movement Nouveau Centre has, therefore, according to them, no right to use shortcut UDF (Union pour la democracy française).
At the same time, remind us that the last Congress UDF voted in the year 2007, to connect to a modem for three years, and for the creation of a committee to defend “moral and practical interests ” associations based Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charettea, continues the Committee, “when registered trade mark ”, not“ for three years, a member of the UDF ”, but the UMP.
Scandalous and fraudulent manner taking advantage of existing marketing authorisation acronym to do so on its own account.
This indiscretion is beginning to convert an offence, and then with irony expressed on the strategy NC: “it seems to us that both in politics and in the ordinary course of life is more valuable to make a name for yourself, than to withdraw from the anonymity of fraudulent with the adoption of the names which do not have the right. ”
Case Liliane Bettencourtové: François Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of state weakness.
The Court of First Instance in Nanterre Friday's decided to judge the artist François Marie Baniera and bring the judgment whether used the state weakness octogenarian billionaire to her of part of its capital, of which it is blaming her daughter Liliane Bettencourtová.
The photographer (62 years), known for his photographs of the famous will be tried 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of state weakness, which is an offence for which a sentence in a maximum duration of 3 years and a fine of EUR 375000.
This Decision establishes that actually takes place process in the case which can be described as a family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which the mother and daughter and attacking each other's fighting for the management of a cosmetic empire l 'Oréal.
15. the criminal court at the same time, however, had ordered the medical examination 87 years Lilian Bettencourtové, which should make the College of three doctors.
An heiress and the main akcionářka L 'Oréal always refused to undergo such examination, certainly not for the conditions offered prosecutors in Nanterre during the investigation.
The doctors who are to be elected on Friday, should draw up a report on 10 March 2010 and at the same time submit a statement of whether the Lilian Bettencourtová could be in a state of weakness, and in which period.
I think it.
The things i talk to her, said after completion of the hearing lawyer lady Bettencourtové, Georges Kiejman.
As far as the lawyer François Bettencourtové - Meyers, Olivier Metznera, the decision of the Court of First Instance.
It's great news (...). Expertise shows that with this old lady who needs protection, manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
What are the two years, the only daughter Bettencourtové Lilian launched criminal proceedings against François Marie Banierovi, photographer and všeumělci, whom they blame you for long years using state weakness of her mother, in order to obtain a billion in the form of cheques, contracts for life insurance or images masters.
But Liliane Bettencourtová always refused to that would have been a photographer, which shall be deemed to be the long-term friend, manipulate.
While the Court to assess the admissibility of an action brought Mrs Bettencourtovou - Meyers, Friday's the speech of lawyers are sometimes changed in the family hour of truth.
The lawyer Lilian Bettencourtové presented three letters, which the client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent his notaries, and in which expressed distrust for her husband Françoisy Bettencourtové - Meyers.
In a letter from the year 2003, Liliane Bettencourtová according to an attorney adds: “could you my daughter explain that i Banierovi wrote for a period of 15 years, once or twice a day.
Since i got married, i am with Francois could never talk. ”
The prosecution in Nanterre again found that the negotiations stěžovatelky is not justified, the more that foster the judge in these days of rejected its request for the initiation of the procedure for the issue of legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourtová “is quite able to participate in the court, is not under the protection of not in custody.
No one else will act for her, ” confirmed representative Prosecutor, Marie - Christine Daubigneyová.
The Court of First Instance finally decided to the justification for Mrs. Bettencourtové - Meyers expressed in the time of the opening of the procedure.
Management of the revolution or end of economic intelligence?
If nothing's gon na change in the management of large french companies, our fight for the development of the economic intelligence was useless.
For more than ten years of the behaviour of the management of large companies vis-à-vis staff to consumer access companies before marketing revolution: it is to identify collaborators with a “values ” means the designated from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose the consumer products which were obtained from the ideas of Heads of factory technicians.
The fact that the client has become a centre of entrepreneurial companies marketing strategy, the conquest of the market in the right direction... even if authoritarian efforts to force the products, different from consumer preferences, periodically back!
Passive access of workers may lead to death demoralizaci.
Suicide in firms France Telecom, dog, or Renault's only visible part of a more general extended phenomenon, which extends predominantly managerial cadres.
This demobilisation adversely affects the development of all intellectual function of the company, including research and development, and, what is more important, economic intelligence.
And really, El “requires all interested parties (...) active approach and the ability to predict ” and requires from the staff of the commitments, which are contrary to the revenue authoritarian management.
That's why we call on the managerial revolution, which should aim to bring the staff at the center of the interests of the company as well as a client.
The relative the usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Internal opinion polls - as the questionnaire submitted by staff of Orange - will contribute to a revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, i am afraid not.
Because i am convinced himself that, in the face of the new situation of the structure of the different turns back give priority to this... what i always do!
In addition, therefore, that authoritarianism, as one of the pathology, power, increases in proportion to the seriousness of own failures.
And finally, since most of the managerial staff has simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates for engineers have mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Due to the convenience of osvojují old behavioristickou theory, currently again renewed “neuroscience ” from the US and widely digital without too much knowledge of the scientific institutes and the media.
With it, that it is possible to move “levers ” (SiC) the involvement of managers, showed a recent survey of the Agency Ipsos on pages of Figaro. FR, which only strengthens the case management staff in their position of mechanical management, considered unsuitable for today's world.
To identify and measure the factors of mobilization.
On the contrary, the management of the revolution is necessary for the proper functioning of the modern businesses, provides for the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
Lies in the integration of the basic insight into all the projects and practice of management: for staff will be obligations towards the company can only if they seem clear means to achieve their dreams, ambition and projects.
Currently, this concept of staff motivation address only the study motivačně functional analysis.
These studies have shown that evaluates its undertakings on the basis of a predetermined Dox, which enables them to get the picture, by means of the company says, assess what offers them to implement their living objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these factors of mobilisation may executives check, anticipate and anticipovat on their “social performance ”, and to bring its management of human resources' on the right path. ”
This creates a breeding ground for the development of a sound and effective economic intelligence.
Manifestation of the Oslo accords: “a just war ” Obama merit praise from the right.
The american right on Friday welcomed the speech that Barack Obama made the day before that in Oslo, happy with the that the holder of the Nobel Peace Prize for the year 2009 defended the concept of a “just war, ” against enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who at first laughed at the price of Obama's 9 October, this time Presidential speech applauded, including Sarah Palin, the former candidate to vice in elections in 2008.
I like what you said, she said, Palin, muse right-wing republican wings, for the USA Today, and added that she herself on the subject, “sometimes necessary ” war expressed in his memoirs, which are based.
The war is, of course, the last thing the Americans would have on the job, but it is necessary.
All the terrorists, there should be retention, the Commission is of the view.
President Obama, who inherited the two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his předchůdciGeorge W. Bush, Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of the forces and used the expression to clarify its decision to send another 30,000 troops in Afghanistan nine days before.
Other Obama's opponent, Newt Gingrich, considered that the President did in Oslo, “a very good job ”.
I think that speech was really a very good, he congratulated a former chairman of the House of Representatives, who approved of, in particular, the President's mention of “the existence of evil in the world ”.
In a way, i considered this speech totally historical, said during the conversation on the radio, Gingrich “the Takeaway ”.
The former Member, which some considered as possible of the republican candidate in the presidential election in the year 2012, was delighted to see “leftist president, ” recalled to the members of the Committee for the Nobel Prize,“ that they would not be free and we could transmit the price for peace, if the use of forces exist. ”
By Michael Gerson, former author of George W. Bush, editor of the Washington Post, Obama made “very american speech ”.
Not only had introduced himself as “cosmopolitans ” as always, but“ spoke as America's president, ” and he reminded the Europeans' that live in the safe bubble, which was created by themselves, and that they do not do too much to keep her, ” the Gerson's.
Among the few malcontents from among the right belongs to the Hawk the Bush years, a former ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, which show called “featureless, pompous and without inspiration ”, as stated on the websites of the National Review online.
To the left of the President, for example, the democratic representative of Dennis Kucinich's horrified at the sight of Barack Obama, as justifies the use of force.
“When the war packed in a carton of justice, we can easily justify massacre innocent people, ” he warned.
However, medium - left-wing printing is against the president of applause opinion.
Although the Los Angeles Times will continue to be the price level of Obama for early, evaluate its output as “nadvýkon ” and even for the speaker known your talent.
The Oslo accords should serve as a guide to international decision in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression ", passionately shows the California's diary.
Obama “said speech what was necessary ”, the New York Times, and speech marked“ for a simple and instructive. ”
Road carriers: three marathon to the Agreement, which will save the delivery of the stock at Christmas.
After three rules marathon road carriers TLF ran out of trade unions and employers' organisations, the only one that remained to the end, Friday night to the Agreement, which ended the challenge to strike and the threat that hung over the supply of stocks at Christmas.
Secretary of State for transport, Dominique Bussereau Friday's the signature of the Agreement expressed “pleasure ” and that after a few negotiations which started in the middle of the morning.
After the second night of discussions with the negotiators on Friday morning broke up, in the hope that the text of the agreement will be signed as quickly as possible, at the end of the morning.
And in spite of the fact that three of the employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) of the negotiations withdrew.
But it was the need for further more than six hours, meetings, which began in 11 hours, all agreed and in 18 hours podepsaliznění agreement.
“Would this conflict undertakings very hurt ” and“ would risk a danger that will be distorted by the holidays at the end of the year, ” he said Bussereau.
The text of the text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% in those high salaries (international transport).
Hourly wages in the lowest salaries increased from EUR 8,72 9,06.
It's not much, but it's in a lot of effort, he explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will get our members of the command to avoid, no blockade of supply centres.
But it may occur for a few opponents, who are not satisfied, 'he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, said “the agreement ”, though it was hard to admit to an increase in the high salaries owing to international competition. ”
According to him, an increase of EUR 170 a month in the lowest wages and of 100 to EUR 120 for the highest.
It is a deal of common sense and respect for staff, he said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the “historic Agreement ”.
According to Richard Jauberta (the CGT) in the case of “an acceptable compromise. ”
The agreement also provides for the revalorisation of travel expenses at the level of 3% and a report on the situation of the state of road transport in the first half of the year 2010, which will also focus on the question of the 13 th salary and modernisation of collective agreements.
Bussereau said “reduction of EUR 100 million in taxes on wages undertakings ” which was the subject of the government on the draft law on the budget for the year 2009, which participated in the night of the National Assembly on Thursday, Friday.
The government will ask the Senate on “equal ” vote.
Signature allows that this agreement will be the subject of a first to undertakings which are members of that organisation, later to the whole field, in the case of the extension of the Ministry of Labour.
This shall be carried out “in the shortest possible time, ” said Bussereau.
The process may impede the only opposition employers' organisations.
The organisation FNTR talk about “the wrong shop ” for EUR 100 million,“ it was sector offered in the framework of the compensation of carbon tax ”.
Secretary of State for the transport of us made for emergency meeting not as a result of mutual analysis, but to angry eater turkeys at the time of the approaching Christmas holidays, she complained Unostra.
For the organisation of Otre there is a risk that agreement in the next 12 months' they bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMES) from the scope.
Suburban trains RER and: interruption of transport on the weekend, trade unions with the proposals of the transport undertaking RATP.
Interruption of transport on the line of peri-urban trains RER and, which is the largest line urban public transport in France, will continue over the weekend, since Friday's negotiations between the trade unions and the direction of RATP next day strike would not lead to any particular results in otázcežádosti for the premium.
On Saturday and Sunday, i. e., on important purchasing the weekend before Christmas, the trains run between 10 and 20 hour, on the sector (between La Défence and Nation) will ride every other train, outside of this section only one train of four.
Link to SNCF will be discontinued in the Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to transfer to another train.
Commercial houses Galeries Lafayette, which expect every day over 200,000 customers welcomed the fact that “the RATP trying to about zajištěníspojení with large trade houses. ”
Line RER and leads from the West to the East of the Paris agglomerations.
Section a managed RATP leads from Saint-Germain - en - Lay and Nanterre in Boissy - Saint Léger and Marne - la - Vallée.
V Friday was in the toe in the service of a train of two and virtually no set in the time of off-peak as planned.
As well as on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France at landings rule otherwise arranged and confusion.
So early in the morning was in the station Saint-Germain - en - Lay (Yvelines) much less human than usual, inter alia, also because i missed the pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, the engineer, 29 years of Boissy - Saint Léger (Val de Marne) explained that he stood up on the “an hour and a half earlier, to be sure that will arrive in time. ”
The station of Saint Lazarus was crowded, announced the State Railways SNCF had predicted, and a large number of the guardians of the right.
Suburban trains RER and operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy - Le - Haut came or departed from the station of Saint Lazarus with connections to the subway.
The General Assembly of the other strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, on which will evaluate the results of Friday afternoon meeting with management, which trade unions rated as a “weak ”.
The management of RER proposes the negotiations on a specific protocol for suburban trains RER and in all respects, the organisation of working time, the career, etc.
That, however, is not drivers who require deserved the premium, according to Mr Thierry Garona (OdboryJih).
RATP even for the present proposals for the premium, which put worse off the CGT, with the result that the “was not able to solve the problem, while in the travel carriers and SNCF it. ”
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, “closer to review the conditions for the pursuit of the profession ”, clarified the transport undertakings RATP.
Which was the reason why the union thinks that the company “makes weekend passengers kidding. ”
In the morning hours, about 150 drivers busy enterprise Committee in its Paris headquarters.
Leadership, which until now to any debate during the strike, is therefore in the interest of the “calm ” opted for a meeting.
The danger is that the conflict on Tuesday, extend to line RER B, then what Unsa and independent shall notify the strike emergency.
The union calls for the premium in value from 120 (Unsa) to EUR 150, of which EUR 30 variables (the CGT, fo, CFDT, barrel (South), Indépendants (independent)) and make it difficult to the deteriorating working conditions on this route, which daily carry million passengers.
The driver peri-urban trains RER earn in more advanced the career 2200 to 2700 million gross wages and 600 to 650 €premium for irregular working time and working on sundays and public holidays.

- New of Silicon Valley
Long years was true for a city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one in ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, it was strictly guarded location where it was a secret weapons research.
Today it is considered this district with 216 000 inhabitants, remote 37 miles from Moscow Center, as “the Russian Silicon Valley ”.
There are located significant micro - and nanoelektronická research and production of the Centre.
Since September 2008 established zelenogradští representatives of contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Centre Riedberg - with university institutions and firms Frankfurt innovation centres (FIZ).
There has been a number of visits and in the centre of the signed in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg “protocol on close cooperation ”.
The Russian delegation led the Moscow vícestarosta Yuri Rosljak and prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, in Frankfurt signed the clerk of the planning of Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 will go the representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research on the seminar in Science Zelenograd.
Scientific exchange
This is the ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also the economic relations.
FIZu companies will be permitted to Glue for expanding the russian market.
On the contrary, Russia's scientific companies wishing to get the contract in Germany.
Zelenograd is the major russian research institutes and companies.
These include the need to Moscow Institute electron beam technology, large groups Sitronics and Rossijskaja electronics.

Zelenograd (literal translation of “green town ”) gained his name in wooded hilly landscape, into which they are into research establishments.
Stuttgartská brake
Dimension Stuttgart 21 can not sufficiently to prepare.
For fans of the project is quite simply on “the new heart of Europe. ”
All right. S21 is more than run the station, more than a monstrous structure, which to plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg on one decade in desperate construction of Chaos.
Stuttgart 21 arose from the 1980 s.
Overheads station with the rails, which ended in the centre of the city, was then considered transport - technical fossils of the 19 th century, which acts as a brake modern rail transport, since it was the need for enormously much time on přepřáhnutí locomotives from behind the front.
Go, go, stop for a moment - so it should work.
And that's why disappear overheads station: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: transit station, which is roughly in the middle of the routes of the trans-european rail road between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava - hence the slogan on “the heart of Europe ”.
Indeed, starts with S21, although the vision of the 1980's already are not compatible with the facts.
Themselves very ambitious developers recognized that in Hessen and bavarian city's start construction of almost neufinancovatelné.
Since there is a modern shuttle trains and controlling of motor vehicles at both ends, they do not have problems with zajížděním overheads station and vyjížděním.
Yet: starts with Stuttgart 21, including new ICE track to Ulm.
It imposed the and local politicians.
Track shall cooperate and, therefore, that the risks of the largest individual of the infrastructure project in the Republic shall be borne by the taxpayer and no public concern.
A project can be urbanisticky still some way to apologize.
A new urban areas, which - if we trust the computer pictures designer - will contain many green.
For rail transport system is a S21 harmful.
The construction of the track gauge train station and are intended for passenger transport, which is - typically in the 1980's - attributed a huge increase.
Then there was no competition from low-cost flights.
Modern transport policy has to go but primarily on the strengthening of the freight, because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than a freight car on the road.
But a new line is not due to a sharp slope suitable for freight trains.
Even more important is that S21 indirectly affected by a lot of other railway projects.
In Švábsku should bury a good six billion euros.
That's the official number.
The experts shall be deemed to be the real ten to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade will be missing finances to other hub points and narrow places on the network.
On the list of the Ministry of Transport is sixty larger projects.
One of the most important is the construction of approximately 180 miles long routes the valley of the shadow of the Rhine.
Since 1987, building on this route, slow pace.
There would be a need for a push.
But S21 will be as a brake.
The valley of the Rhine happens neck bottles of international freight transport: directly in the heart of Europe.
The government is examining the judgment on the airport
The Provincial Government left in the earth wiesbadenském open, if he goes against the judgment of the Court of Justice (VGH administrative Hessen) concerning the ban on night flights and leave him be revised.

VGH in Kassel today in writing to justify that the State had to in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway Frankfurt Airport newly Edit a prohibition of flights.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23. and 5 p. m., as foreseen by the Provincial Government does not match the law ordered by the protection of the population against the night air noise.
The coalition must decide to 4 January, if you will require a revision of the judgment.
This delay and dorážela criticised the opposition to representatives of governments to renounce the revision of the Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The fraction of the SPD Torsten Schäfer - Gümbel called the CDU FDP again and returned to the promises of the ban on night flights, which gave before choosing a. otherwise, it is possible to be classified as “breach of the words ”.
It's damned hard to, if you can keep your word, said the head of the green Tarek Al - Wazir in to the election slogan FDP “we word we have. ”
The Minister for Posch refused to criticism Schäfer - Gümbela, the Provincial Government tries to through “distortions rights and tricks ” to get to their night flights.
The precise legal control needs your time.
The coalition will not work on the basis of the first impression “fast ”.
We need a realistic decision, he said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Statements by its fractions for a ban on the flights were never such as given by the opposition.

“Significantly lower examination burden, ” said the Chairman accreditation of the Council Reinhold Grimma, should be“ stopped bad development, which significantly limited the performance of studies. ”
The study should be “performance ” in the future“ the decisive criterion ” in the implementation of.
Modules and the contents of the “must hard check ” to“ unnecessarily restrict student in the selection
Seminars ”.
Students should “entitled to space, which allows and supports the own initiative ”.
Rules are to apply for approval of new study disciplines, after an examination but also for existing study scopes.
You need to be “přeakreditovat ” every five years, which, however, means that it will take up to 2015, check all academic disciplines.
Responsible for that is all over Germany ten accreditation agencies, which shall be subject to the conditions established by the accreditation advice.
The Ministers of Culture called in October “strongly ” of the Land to agencies were so that the content of curriculum was not too large and examination has not been strict.
In the individual Länder is already universities have agreed with terrestrial ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country pledged Rhineland-Palatinate additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.

You want to country and high school to spend ten million euros.

According to her, for the termination of the study of the module should be required only a single test.
The study should be more flexible, it has to be guaranteed by the recognition of tests from other universities and relieve the disclosure of the master's degree.
By the end of next year should be inspected performance of all study fields in the country.
The government and the opposition Thursday again arguing about study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise fell also criticism of resolution.

More than a footnote to Müllerové Herta
Get into Germany and out it's nice, almost no control. ” sounds start line one poems poet of Werner Söllnera, which in this torn language piece of tematizuje experience with přicestováním one dissident, which won freedom, at the same time came but on its linguistic environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in rumunském Banátu, he worked at first as a teacher of german and english in Bucharest and later as the one of the children's book publisher, 1982, then moved to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner was honoured by the different literary prices, 1993, he lectured poetry to the legendary Frankfurt Goethe University, and since 2002 is head of the Hessen fora literature in Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A considerable commotion took care mimoliterární last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, on which the “german literature in Romania in the mirror, and the cracked mirror its security act ”.
Obviously znejistělý and subdued Söllner left a statement in which you before colleagues writer romanian Germans, inter alia, Richard Wagner, William Totokem, Franz Hodjakem and Helmuth Frauendorferem, according to the cooperation as a secret informant romanian secret service of the Securitate.
Together with some of the present Söllner acquired in 1989, the german language price.
Naverbování attempts he began quietly, first in 1971.
I Söllner, he continued, “that is, someone who is not sufficiently attempts to intimidation by the Securitate. ”
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel laureate Hertě Müllerové and its unprecedented literary settlement with mechanisms dictatorial governments is a literary scene, and especially community german authors originating in Romania, shaken case, which indicates the depths and disgraceful political system, which is based on the control and špicování.
Werner Söllner is, at least, if it can be said in accordance with the current state of knowledge, i suspect, but it is also a victim.
In the acts Securitate played a secret agent Walter a role, he said after Söllnerově confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive effect on a secret agent Walter.
“Vysekával ” me in all relevant points for him, he says Markel.
Has a moral obligation to make this note.
Söllnerovo statement was in this form and before this audience unexpected, but absolutely astonishing return of the former dissident and its cooperation with the secret service is not.
Herta Müllerová wrote in July, when i read their own ACP 914 parties that Germany was a pleasant reservations for stool Securitate.
Concerned, it can be assumed, will be to speculate, and in some cases even i know that name behind code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Otherwise than in the domestic, in the meantime, i have a very a review of the Stazi is handling the estate control Securitate very diffuse.
In the last few years have been systematic awareness raising Barbara and restricted.
One of the Birthlerových offices, the responsibility of the National Council for processing the Securitate (CNSAS), was founded in 1999, the issue of the act was done since more at length.
Only from the year 2005 there is a law which governs the management of folders.
The members of that former Securitate have in Romania still showed a great influence, following the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müllerovou one conversation in which is one of the former Securitate from Timisoara expressed about carrying the valuation dismissively.
He's got psychosis, after all, was questioned only once.
Potupení power here quite openly expressed in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, that the case Söllner, as in relation to the zamlčeným guilt, linked the inevitable questions.
Why now? who do harm to Söllnerovo audience? Special Response granting leaves to expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the more the desire for knowledge than after přiřknutí guilt and shame.
The Genesis work Herta Müllerové that yesterday has adopted the Nobel Prize, it's more than a footnote.
Saturated the Champions League
It looked as if it came from a purely commercial agent dressed like a neat Christmas party, which was the manufacturer of sports goods sweets, when he a quarter of an hour after midnight to attracted by the Mercedes class C new basketball coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by orange coloured Keep sachet sponsor.
The bald man with more after he left for him to have a strange town.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk happiness was 55letý man too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it will continue work.
Or was it just begins.
Only three days committed the words: “we have reached osmifinále ”, namely in the Champions League thanks výhře3: 1 above Unirea Urziceni from Romania,“ but we can not leave the impress of success: will it brutally hard struggle against sestoupení. ”
“Far more important task ” is in front of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz power from the royal class and in ordinary League date.
And to avoid the obvious weaknesses again after three quick goal Maricy (5.), Träsche (8) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Drawing
Osmifinále Champions League (match 16 / 17. + 23 / 24 February / retaliation match 9 / 10. + 16 / 17 March) will draw lots of 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of třeskavého onset of Babbelova successor is therefore maintained.
Not only in the healer, uncertain stuttgartským professionals he added in a short period of confidence, willingness to deployment and joy of the game.
I went to the players and i told them to focus on its strengths and urged them to be more daring, explained the healer souls Gross so simply denominated successful recipe which, but for the action of a therapist Babbela reveal but no more efficiency.
Stoked a magic, he admitted Babbelův supporters Jens Lehmann, “when in football is a new impulse, sometimes things happen, possible. ”
And Khedira who, after mnohatýdenní break due to injuries, thanks to its dynamism now the best player on the field, he tried to describe the “phenomenon ” proverbial“ fresh wind ” and working procedures of the new manager: “this is a man who's radical and requires discipline.
That's what in the current situation, we need. ”
For Babbela obviously missing.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet saved, warns sports the President Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs but more stability.
As the Gross will not even players and managers should not be overestimated victory against the weakened spare and completely overloaded the defense of the romanian guest.
We won, even in Glasgow, ere ugly waking up after slaughter 0: 4 in Leverkusen, consider Khedira.
And sporting the President Horst Heldt reminded that has achieved one of the objectives of the season, the other, but it is still far away.
We are not in the water.
That Heldt to celebrate my 40 th birthday, even after the first domestic victory after three months, was caused by a weekend events that were alive with in the form of a tv interview with goalie Jensem Lehmann just before the start of the game.
Decisions which engaged the other and no Jens, he replied Heldt on hard Lehmannovu criticism.
Throw that in my face the board of directors of weak leadership and decided to change the coach for pressure pubertal fans.
And that was canceled his day off after the games, called Lehmann as a sign of the missing sovereignty and envy.
Lehmannovy statements “formulates net egoism, ” he replied Heldt and the consequences for the Keeper.
I guess we both in their 40 s will not have no joy in life.
Anyway, they are for one to the other, without work deposed coaching team would not be possible hráčsky so strong and warlike performance.
Babbel and his assistants were “a large share of success, ” says Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agrees.

Case Kundúz
Frontal attack from the opposition: the head of the fraction of green Jürgen Trittin called because of poor information regarding the Kundúz Secretary of Defense Guttenberga a liar.
The SPD and Link (left) invite the Chancellor to use an explanation.
Hamburg / Berlin - according to the latest knowledge to raid on the opposition Kundúz believes that Secretary of Defense Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) made of a deliberate deception.
The Minister of the deadly bombing two tanks in September said “intentionally false ”, said the chief fraction of green Jürgen Trittin in Saturday's news show ARD“ Tagesschau ”.
Let's call it regular expression: lied.
The order to the killing was issued when the non-respect of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan.
It is the nature of the report which had NATO, which he read, Mr. Guttenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became clear that the attack was not only of the destruction of the kidnapped trucks, but a targeted killing two leaders of the Taliban.
In the U. S. air raid that requested the german master Kundúzu Colonel Klein, occurred in the investigation of NATO to kill or injury to 142 people.
Green, the SPD and Link called on Saturday the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to immediately before the expressed the assembly and also clarify what actually knew Guttenberg of this event.
Mrs. Merkel must explain, if it's strategy targeted killings part of the Assembly of the Afghan policy - and, if the Chancellor, Bundeswehr and Intelligence, this new strategy approved, called Jürgen Trittin and colleague from the green Renate Künastová.

It is noted that have not yet received any answer.
The Ministry of Saturday expressed to criticism and pointed out that this will be addressed in a committee of inquiry of the assembly, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds dreams
Some sees in a waking state of images and hear the voices that others can not see and hear.
Not only the mentally ill or in the drug frenzy with the border between the imagination and reality.
Until this happens in my sleep, it's all right.
If you are lying down, closed his eyes in the dark room, may we will surround the wild ideas and fantasy delusions.
But who has experienced in the vigilance of abnormal dreaming, see and hear things that others can see and hear, is true in today's the western world majority for a fool or a drug dependent, or at least as a freak.
But such images and voices not only for the mentally ill or in the drug intoxication.
The guilt is our imagination: the same neuronal processes that allow us to propose houses, paint pictures or write novels, here and there sees to it that blend of the frontier between a dream and reality.
The dreams of the altered state of consciousness may be present in various forms, in better if we call them a vision in the worse delusion.
Even if the promoter and effect may vary, however, vision mystičky Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet New Age Carlos Castanedy, shaman's conditions delirium, psychoses and hallucinations derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions arise if the derailment balance neuronal transmitérů dopamine in the brain serotonin and noradrenaline, acetylcholine - and interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
A comprehensive hallucinations and wandering thoughts occur frequently in schizophrenic psychosis.
He does not have much gravity above him
The link between the delusions of employed and dream of philosophers and doctor since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucination as a form of the dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychology, he said in 1861 “great resemblance ravings of a dream states ”, for Sigmund Freud was a dream even“ psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception senses. ”
It's autumn 2001, Henning t. is amended in comic figure.
His body is 2-d and brightly colored.
Gravity has no power over him, floating in the ceiling of the room.
Feels nakopnutí.
Behind him the winged spirited figures with blood red grimace, cenící teeth.
Chasing him, a heavy, flaming boots, throws with him on the wall, he feels the pain of its body.
A loud, wicked voices from the walls and there is a risk of the radio.
I can not stand the voices, cursing and insult to him.
Henning T. pulls two cables of stereo, zauzlí into loops and attached it to a hook in the ceiling.
Rises to one speaker and will have a noose around my neck.
Jump.
Loop is granted.
Learn a chorus of voices shouting, tearing his eardrums, “Go to the clinic and leave to treat! ”
Today's Henning T. 40 years, i have six acute psychosis, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
They were running LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoafektivní paranoid psychosis, besides a manic-depressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He had learned to live with his illness, three years he's married.
I had the worst fear in psychosis and highest doubt, he says.
Ghosts are terrible facts
About one percent of people get sick at least once in the life of schizophrenia in psychiatric clinics is that after the depression of the second most commonly treated with the disease.
In acute disability usually schizophrenic psychosis can not distinguish between internal and external world, into přebuzeného state, which may lead to relationship delusions, hallucinations, size or the illusion of pursuit.
Especially enlarged's hearing voices - voices that orders, comment, or lead dialogs.
No optical delusion is not unusual.
The affected is unable to distinguish important from unimportant, brain can not filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just like a dream opens psychosis the floodgates of ideas and fantasy, which originate in the deepest layers of consciousness.
Perception of reality in psychosis is concentrated on the body, says professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the clinic of the General psychiatry university clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the centre of the action, everything is relevant oriented to him.
At the same time, getting into the passive role, it becomes, like in a dream, conquered events and can not is actively shape.
Schizophrenics is therefore often threatened, monitored and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is not possible, for most of the ghosts are terrible facts, awakening is out of the question.
Once in a lifetime experience hallucination
Otherwise than in a dream, she says, “but Fuchss remains sensual and spatial structure of the fact that a man sees in psychosis, fundamentally retained. ”
Wandering thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, to the theft of experience in real framework.
Scientists are still a puzzle why exactly our brain makes such a.
Special conditions may, for each person in the short term, lead to lose its relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone but will develop into psychoses.
It appears that there is a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but the study on the twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists are based on the fact that disabled persons shall have a minimum of brain damage.
We believe that in an early stage of development of the damage to the brain, for example, neuronal maturation of viral disease mothers during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
Remains but puzzled, as there is a malfunction in neuronal system, which is not shown in the long years.
Role of also influences the neighborhood - stress or traumatic experiences may be promoter psychosis, if it is to her disposition.
Also hallucinogenic drugs may start psychosis, because interfere with the transfer system.
When our brain weld
Crazy is that psychotronici suffers from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, swallowed expensive medication, others give you money for drugs to be gained, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
If the images we perceive as a pleasant or unpleasant, is often only a question of position.
Kasten collects already ten years reports of hallucinations and, in the last year, interpreted its results in the book, “Die Welt in unserem irreale Kopf ” (real world in our head).
Hallucinations are not the typical associated phenomena psychosis, but also to a surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to the psychiatric disorders such as a borderline personality or depression also often diseases like a migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer or brain trauma.
Surprisingly halucinuje, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy man.
Hallucinations, according to Kastena, consist of the contents of the ideas that are normally suppressed.
Arise, as part of the brain, which processes sensory perception, are too active or little repressed; in our brain seal or if the missing stimulation.
The drugs may this start as well as the brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of incentives, stress, concerned with love or other additional special conditions.
In more recent studies gave up to one-third of the respondents that at least once in his life had a hallucination.
In the summer of 2005 is Sarah K. 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and goes to the grammar school.
In fact, completely normal girl.
If there were not the patterns and voices.
On the breaks may become that it appeals to Hulk with long, dark hair.
If he answers, they are looking at her classmates with surprise - no one but it can not see and hear this boy.
This shy girl regarded stiff dreamer, but Sarah K., knows it.
He's awake, hears and sees that boy, just like hears and sees a girl sitting beside him in the bench.
He could feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, has the boy like you.
Am i crazy?, he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other images are not real and disappears.
At night rather bleak appearance
They are often delusions burden.
Sitting in class, can not how many times monitor teaching, because the teacher in her eyes and ears just represents a new classmate, but he explains all other audibly, and visible on the board of the mathematical equation.
Appearance at night rather dismal.
When is waiting for you in the dark room to sleep that comes seldom and too late, can not often, if he's awake or asleep, if the images that sees grimace, or a girl with bleeding scratches wounds on hands and feet are open or closed in front of her eyes.
Leave me alone, shouting at you.
Parents and friends say nothing about it, thought would think of her, that's crazy.
The autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years.
Last year i graduated and live with my boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Since on the Internet contacted a psychologist Kastena, knows exactly that mad.
Delusions are also art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or removed stimuli, will most likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I believe that the brain then does not have enough employment and old himself for his amusement.
Sarah, an only child, she was a little girl, fear of the other children, often play alone.
Her hallucinations began, when in the 13 learned that a man who says papa since she thinks is not her own father.
Because the visual and acoustic hallucinations are active the same brain areas which process also real images and sounds, it is for the handicapped as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish from delusion and reality. “every experience, ” says Kasten,“ it takes place in the brain, the reality is that displays.
Hallucinations are also the images that will arise brain, therefore work so real. ”
Also the dreams evaluates Kasten as a form of hallucinations.
Hallucinations healthy people differ substantially from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to the schizophrenic are mentally healthy people able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten advises therefore patients to rated hallucination as a special ability.
Border state between dreams and hallucinations
In our world concentrated too to consciousness is an imaginary experience, unfortunately, by a majority of patologizován, says Michael Schmidt - Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic hospital Florence - Nightingale in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is heavy, útrpná disease, but it also positive side, creativity - a mirage is also the art of despair.
Schmidt - Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroidní form of experiences, a special form of the amended consciousness to dream.
Oneiroidní conditions are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that concerned shall be deemed to be the actual and can not be distinguished from waking even retroactively.
Oneiroidní state of consciousness is produced in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, e. g. patients polyradikulárním inflammation, who are experiencing fully conscious motor paralysis.
When a man is threatened by the loss of the world, and myself, should be continued, the complete inability to move, shall be replaced by the life - threatening the real situation to one of your own, an imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt - Degenhard.
Type of border state between dreams and hallucinations.
Because in reality it is not possible to deal with a situation, there is a change in the worlds, the real situation but zpřítomní into images.
Intensive form of aid senses and transfer of senses in an intolerable situation, which allows us to people's own ability to shape, go during the time to loss of consciousness.
All's fair, and later in memory
Also, the historian art Peter Cornelius Claussen describes your oneiroidní experiences in his book “Herzwechsel ” (exchange of the heart) as a rescue mission of the soul.
He was 49 years after the operation, when the heart valves with subsequent heart transplantation published his consciousness on a few days the path, and his body was lying motionless in intensive care.
Claussen sank into a world that had formed, visited foreign time and place: the old man upoutaným on the bed, in the train the sanatorium, the robot guarding his health.
He lives in an early medieval times between the nobles, which produces the narcotic substances from the blood.
I can carry him on a motorcycle in their own country, in a hospital bed surf on the firnu in the Alps, and meets the korean mobster.
Completely immersed in an imaginary going on all's fair, and later in memory.
These internal path for Claussena fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is different status, describes the experience.
In contrast to the dreams are memories of the mental disorders for years and in immaterial details clearly understood.
Even clearer and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience is smashing the horizon of our other opravdivých experience, says psychiatrist Schmidt - Degenhard.
After all, show oneiroidní conditions, psychosis, hallucinations and drug frenzy, how fragile are even in a waking state our internal images of external reality.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarises the psychologist Kasten, “can lead to distortion of what we call reality. ”
The fact that may also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
In 27 are to take over the publisher children
New leading publisher Kallen is a temporary solution: long-term wants to Hubert Burda forward to his business to the hands of their two children, he said der Spiegel.

FonPeek yesterday, which was presented to try Le Web site, the version of the invention, and at the same time his third transformation.
Is limited, as well as his american counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
Monthly price for the maintenance of the amounts to around EUR 12 per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
The people of passengers smartphonem already know what it means to lose data services after crossing the border or impatiently search café with WiFi connection (or Fon), to be able to see the mail.
The idea of roomingem at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should be introduced for a long time.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, the man needed a PhD from physics, to understand them, and also very good glasses to read a miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly reduced fares roaming calls to be accessible for all of Europe, which still has the effect.
There is a reasonable fear of the use of data services outside the home state.
That such a device as FonPeek (interestingly, still has the name Fon when there is no WiFi) have made this type of fare, means that operators are beginning to think otherwise and considering the various offer kterýmiby compensate your data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offers you downloading of books and other search on the Internet.
No treaty, no complications.
This device is connected and pay the purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what i expect that once occurs in případěFonPeek, it is the option to purchase with permanent access as the Peak has already established in the US.
Not because i wanted to buy.
I am looking at the post office on the phone, thank you.
I expect that, because i think it's from the perspective of the consumer the best type.
It would be interesting, if the same system to use on your computer.
Color, kterouzbožňuje Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly a favorite color the ladies of the US.
In function for the onset of US President Barack Obama's chose clothes and coat in this color, the same color was also elected, when it was in the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize laureate in Oslo.
Michelle Obama is very similar to that of the models used in both cases: in addition, that it is a similar color - lime with glittering effects -, in both cases, this was a three-piece ensemble - clothes, jacket and coat from the same substance - garnished with great embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it appeared that the first lady of the US decided to go in the footsteps of asturijské princesses and wear a similar clothes.
The substance, of which the clothes made, both models significantly different.
On taking up their duties, Michelle used a lace, in Oslo Velvet imprinted with.

75% of the working mothers to work problems associated with maternity.
Discrimination in respect of employment has increased in recent years, especially in younger years, which they intend to a child.
This is the result of the study 'fertility and working career spanish women' by CSIC, in cooperation with the Institute of women.
The studies included 9.737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of the working mothers have limited options in the labour market because of motherhood.
Study emphasises that, at the beginning of the partner cohabitation there are many differences of opinion on the number of children, depending on whether they are working or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, starting with the partner to live before, before the first child gives birth and generally have more children.
From the other side, women with stable employment, in particular in the public sector, the partner co-existence and maternity postpone, and have less offspring.
“The women from 35 to 49 years with stable employment have first child in diameter 3.7 years from the beginning of coexistence with partner these figures shall be EUR 4.1. in the case of women, kterédosažení his stable employment to pay the greater part of his life, and therefore had to postpone the partner co-existence and the coming of the children.
The type of the profession has also strong influence on maternity, although less effect on the initiation of coexistence with the partner, ” explains Margarita Delgado, which shall be given to research in CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women in the time of the conclusion of the marriage anarození offspring is the degree of education.
Research indicates that the higher the level of education, the higher is the age when women marry and have their first child.
The differences are also among the women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years of women with the basic and higher education given birth of her first child aged 25,1 or 32,1.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic schooling, gives birth and marry the first baby before they find a stable employment, while the women with a medium or high education forwarded to reverse prefer to obtain a stable employment, prior to the conclusion of marriage and the birth of her first child, ” says Delgado.

A. Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote, according to their own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without sense, as if it were the blade of a knife, it nearly killed. ”

No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic, whose literary talent goes hand in hand with folly. ”
O Pío Baroja: “what else was Martín Santos, than to focus on Baroju Joyce?
What else could Benetovi than let Baroju execute Faulknerovou weapons?
What else could Celovi than do the famous at the expense of the glory of the man? ”
A coward aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother was going through our quarters in the district Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 years have passed through kolemní and our dog, crosses saved from the shelter of the weight of a maximum of six pounds, without a word and severely wounded kick it twice.
Our indignation is all the more that we can not see anything funny in such aggression against small and helpless animal which, moreover, it was on a leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident on a walk, when she met with these, she began to worry about my own safety, since such a devil obsessed with the man who think of animal, is able to do the same, and the woman, child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a quiet part of the usual.
The dog all day she.
Of course we have lodged a complaint to the nearest police station, but that it was, and to cause a delicate question, that these cowards assassins were spanish nationality.
Indignation led us to this fact announced.
We do not understand, what's going on with today's youth, when the time that is defenceless animal, which gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not understand, where's the proper manners, respect for the animals and humans.

Positive indication is, however, a better quarantine, since November 2008 is very bad period for benchmarking and a 60% reduction in comparison with the previous year.
The result is that, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles for the last 11 months is about 40% less than in the previous financial year.
From January was prodáno95. 853 vehicles, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick upy, supply, less freight cars and light trucks / bogies.
And not even gloom, which most deplete demand although it is bought a private person, most of the purchases made small and medium-sized firms and téměr in 100% of cases of financing by means of third persons.
The limitations arising from the conclusion of bank lending resources should be added and other factors such as the cessation of activity or continuation of poor economic situation.
In the situation, unlike the coaches, support for the purchase of 2000E too.
In addition to private persons, it is to be noted iosoby business to business license small and medium-sized businesses, which they intend to buy a car Utility to 3,5 tonnes of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, however, the number of operations was confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvamu again recalled that there was a need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles and also and industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).

The system for the handbrake is already mandatory equipment.
As in the case of anti-lock system ABS it even with the management of the stability of the ESP, the other systems manual brake, it becomes mandatory equipment of the European, s. r. o.
In fact, the already forming part of a statutory equipment all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the other is determined by the deadline for the correction of the lack of which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aims to enhance the protection of pedestrians, the works so that it can help to avoid the many collisions.
The hand brake system increases pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system established after the driver.
But not always can this pressure to keep to the end.
According to a study by the manufacturer of automotive parts Bosch, one third of the drivers who have an accident, the brake, before any deduction and half of them did not exercise the full power of the brakes.
When 1.100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires braking system maximum, reducing the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of device, it could be avoided to 1100 fatal accidents per year relating to Strider.
The reduction in the number of will be even more marked - according to the calculations would avoid one of four accidents with an impact on persons - after the introduction of the so-called intelligent systems manual brake.
In this case, the vehicle fitted with a system, which (radar navigation or cameras) collected obstacles and reports them driver, except for a slight braking.
If the driver will respond to him, will help to increase the pressure on the pedal, if it is needed.
If the driver is not responding, even in the case where a collision can not be prevented, the device will be impressed what intensively on the brakes, and to reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.

GM, on the contrary, assured that the decision on the sale of the Saab should be taken in these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish Government increased pressure on the US producer, in order to take a decision as soon as possible.

Also, the offers with dvouspojkovou transmission PDK, has been tested a vehicle with manual rank šestistupňovou speed the chassis, mainly on the roads of the second class in California, in mountain areas with many complex curves.
His behavior may only be qualified as inviolable.
The reduction in the weight of the does not mean that the vehicle to the asphalt.
Rather, on the contrary, we have not tested so small and light model, which would also carried a safety in movement, in turn, even at high speeds.
It's a little athlete able to warm up the muscles in the short run after the time until he ordered a sprint, braking and renewal of the use of the engine.
Whatever we want. thanks procedure, which is so communicative as accurate, whatever indicated with his hands on the steering wheel, it's what car will do.
And make it with surgical precision.
The sound of the engine according to the will of
The sound of V6 boxer, 320 (about 10 more than Boxster S) is very podaření and it is possible to potentiate the him options' Sport 'and by means of a system that modifies the sound of the engine, which was previously used for Panamery.
The capacity of the acceleration is brutal, whether in the suction or recovery.
The hinges are fixed, but no hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt road, which we are crossing with Boxster Spyderem, he was pretty broken, but the car right can potholes.
Electronic support during the journey was almost useless; and while we are in some curves came at dawn on the icing and gravel even in advanced morning.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the funniest on the market, since it was something more than mere modification Boxster S.

Thank you
After the days of wine and roses since the last spring, when inflation assets constituted the prevailing in the mood on the markets, again appeared on the markets of uncertainty, which should not be surprising, because it is already in the natural state in an environment where managers adopted decisions about the future, which is itself an uncertain.
Medicine used the central banks to stabilise the market was the realisation of debt by direct purchase of assets and indirect release of liquidity in the rates close to zero, to ensure that financial institutions could buy assets to a deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets already practically ended, and without doubt its disparate policy of liquidity, beginning to throw a little sand into gears, as it has made the Spanish Central Bank with his auctions last year.
Investors therefore doubts on the ability of the world economy to maintain economic renewal without so heterodox arrangements, and of participating in the return of a reduction in the risk of the proceeds.
The stock market's volatility and differences dluhopisůspolečností again acquired points, although they are still very distant normal level, which have reached at the start of the year.
Member States were forced to socialized private risk, which he touched the public debt.
Once again he pushes on quality and the US, Japan, and Germany have become a haven for the selected investors, which extended the differentiation of the euro-area countries to Germany.
Spain this instability almost was not affected, but at that time came, Standard &amp; Poor's and threatened to new revisions to the reduction in capacity of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is useless for mute supporters of moral hazard, who had once again tried to encumber the conscience of the persons responsible for the world's economic policy for braking devastating consequences of reducing the loan on employment, when in fact it was to announce a new Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between the Emir to restore power in Emirates, and as for Greece, that we have already seen before.
The government, which covers the deficit, elections, and the new government is.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal after Durão Barrosovi.
It does not make sense to Ecofin saving Hungary before non-compliance with foreign payments at the beginning of the year, and to enable the Member countries of the euro, in order to fulfil their obligations.
But what makes sense, it is that the Ecofin Council made the greek government to transparency and bind the own citizens to a common responsibility for the necessary emergency measures in order to maintain stability of their public finances.
If, as we are, we are before the standardisation of the transitional risk premium, after some excesses in supported positions would be in the framework of the expectations.
In the spanish case while our differences in the public debt will increase as well as the bonds of european companies, we do not have to worry about.
If the differences will be reduced and our will further expand, it would be a typically spanish risk.
The matter, Standard &amp; Poor's is just anecdote. when our leading indicators to most of the services of studies anticipate their renewal scenarios and revise its scenario of rise in the year 2011, including OCDE and the European Commission, to be returned to the japanese scenario for the spanish economy it bodes big chance of survival compliance with this warning.
Once again, it seems that it would be a great opportunity to buy the Spanish assets, although so far the “carefully, my friend the driver. ”
