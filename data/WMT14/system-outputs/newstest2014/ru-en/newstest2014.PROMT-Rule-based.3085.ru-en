Germany the first in Europe enters "uncertain sex" at registration of children
Germany will become the first country in Europe where it will be authorized at registration of the children who were born hermaphrodites instead of man's or female to specify "uncertain".
At the child's parents the right for time will leave the column "floor" in the birth certificate blank.
Instead of "F" (female) or the "M" (male) parents can write down "X" (uncertain) for a while.
This decision is directed on to pushing parents to haste with operation on "specification" of a floor.
Statistically, one of 2 thousand newborns in the world is born the hermaphrodite.
Anger because of a sentence to organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survived and relatives of 202 dead as a result of explosion of a bomb in Bali in 2002 angrily reacted to the sentence pronounced to the last of conspirators who appeared before the court and declared that Oumar Patek has to be shot.
Began to flow which spent nearly 10 years which are in hiding as one of the most searched people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment for its role in creation of the explosive devices used during act of terrorism yesterday.
It can be released within 15 years if receives a conditional early release.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacre as a result of attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist region of Kut during which 202 persons were lost, including 88 Australians, and tens more were wounded.
He was also found guilty on some other the charges, including of a wave of explosions of churches connected with terrorism across all Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence though they could insist that the person nicknamed "demolition man" for the reputation of the master in production of explosive devices has to be sentenced to death.
This decision aggravated painful memoirs of mother from Perth with June Kortin who lost the 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jannie in the act of terrorism which is carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly ten years ago.
Hardly constraining tears, she told that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
"I really consider that it has to follow in the footsteps of other guys.
It has to appear before rasstrelny team — Mrs. Kortin AAP told.
— I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no grandsons any more and I will not see my daughters".
The Sari club was destroyed when the massive explosive device put in the van parked outside right after the 11th evening was put on October 12, 2002 in action.
Peter Hughes was in the bar "Paddy" where the suicide bomber blew up the backpack filled with explosive, only 20 seconds earlier.
After that act of terrorism he for a month felled into a coma and "died" three times, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes told that Patek has to share a fate of three other members of a terrorist cell of "Jemaah Islamiyah" responsible for a bloody slaughter — Amrozi, Mukhlas and the Imam Samudra who were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
To keep to it life, well, there are no reasons to keep to it life.
To receive 20 years after killed 202 persons and wounded hundreds — it not so much.
Began to flow is the last of participants of act of terrorism in Bali who appeared before the court.
He disappeared within nearly ten years, but eventually was detained in January, 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad where the American troops killed the former leader of "Al-Qaeda" Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During judicial proceedings the agent of FBI showed that the intelligence data testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in attempt to reestablish communication between terrorist groups of Southeast Asia and "Al-Qaeda".
"He did not give up" — Mrs. Kortin told.
Until recently he did not regret for that at all, how many he grieved other people.
The sentence is pronounced in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of act of terrorism which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
"This year there will be many tears" — Mrs. Kortin speaks.
Began to flow still can appeal against the sentence.
Medvedev counts that the SSJ-100 plane will be delivered to Europe
Russia counts that after fixing in the markets of Latin America and Asia the Superjet 100 planes will be delivered and to Europe.
"We count that in total we will receive such arrangements more, than on 170 copies of planes of this kind", - quotes "Interfax" of the Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, told them at a press conference with the prime minister of France Jean-Marc Airo.
The head of the Russian government noted that with the French colleagues serious cooperation as it is the joint project is adjusted.
We discussed today some financial questions which are connected with insurance, but we hope that after this plane will become stronger in the markets of Latin America and in the Pacific Rim, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will be sometime delivered and to France", - the Russian prime minister emphasized.
SSJ-100 - the plane constructed by the Sukhoi Civil Aircraft Company company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers the high quality standards and comfort in a segment into 100 passenger seats.
The goalkeeper of "Chicago" Nikolay Khabibulin emphasized: he understands that has to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will diligent continue to work at trainings.
In the last two meetings of "Hawks" Khabibulin at first let through six pucks from "Tampa Bay", and then four - from "Ottawa", and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth let-through puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not manage it, - Khabibulina quotes CSNChicago.
- I should find confidence on trainings, probably, it is worth approaching them as to games, and to try to reach the best result.
You have to study the last games and work over those shortcomings which were.
There are some small components which I should improve, but on trainings I feel pretty well.
But for some reason after several heads everything turns into some snowball.
Probably, I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I do not think that I such one - always try to hold ideal game.
If I pass four, five, six, I not delighted.
No matter, that occurs before my gate.
I still work on myself not to let through so many pucks.
It is healthy that my clubmates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to carry out them much better.
But it happened that happened.
I have to put it aside.
I will simply try to win back the following match better.
Power industry of Dnepropetrovshchina began the unique program for rescue... nests of storks
In old times to accustom to the yard of storks, peasants on a high column established a wheel from a cart, and the heavy nest is good on it kept.
Such special support are not put for a long time therefore storks chose columns of power lines - the bound branches lean on wires thanks to what the aistiny lodge costs reliably.
The grandmother Ania near which house in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky area years twenty there lives the aistiny family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all efforts of his inhabitants.
Birds put from above new branches, and the lower layer already gave between wires, just about will fail.
Of course, it is a pity for seven storks who nested every year at a farmstead, removed and brought up for summer of three-four baby birds, but also there is no wish to remain without electricity.
As soon as birds departed to warm regions, the grandmother Ania called in Tsarichansky RES which possesses a support.
And did not even expect that there will react so quickly.
When our experts arrived to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest in general still keeps, - the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky told.
On wires which appeared, in fact, already in the nest weighing 150 - 200 kilograms corrosion began.
At any moment of a bird could be lost from an electric discharge.
And locals risked to remain without electricity because of damage of wires.
Therefore linear adjusters began operation on rescue of a nest, and any more not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnepropetrovsk national university who developed the scheme of transfer of a nest helped.
They provided trainings for employees of regional networks.
The famous Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineering specialists at all stages of reconstruction of nests.
For a start counted that in area in an emergency state there are more than 50 aistiny "apartments".
For their reconstruction the special metal platforms reminding a funnel were welded.
The basis was braided willow branches, and then transferred an old nest there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis that birds learned a nest and returned to it.
Already then storks will complete the dwelling.
A month ago in the village the Sandwort of the Novomoskovsk area the first nest was reconstructed.
Near an electrosupport put a new ferroconcrete column and placed on it a platform with the old, already rendered habitable nest.
All operation cost to power engineering specialists nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housewarming took place in the village of Ivanovka of the Petrikovsky area on the grandmother Ania's farmstead.
Here the platform was fixed on a former place, only raised over wires.
Ornithologists are sure that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" underwent capital repairs.
Until the end of the year the same reconstruction expects four more nests in Pokrovsk and Tsarichansk the Areas of Dnepropetrovshchina.
By the way, while one rescue rare birds, others ruthlessly kill them.
The other day all area was flown by a sad message - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky area, in the opening day of hunting for pheasants, poachers for the sake of entertainment shot the swan family living on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - locals fed them and did not offend.
When villagers, having heard shots, came running to a pond, four handsome swans already lay on water the dead.
Now the staff of Apostolovsky regional department of militia finds out who shot at the birds included in the Red List.

Vitaly Mutko: Water-cannons?
It seems to me, we on about 15 years ago returned.
The minister of sport Vitaly Mutko expressed the opinion on disorders on tribunes during the Russian Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am the supporter of that organizers of sports events were responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we see that they took a drgy position.
They wait that someone will come from the party and will bring an order.
It is very good position, but not absolutely correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs have to invite the stewards, but not let matters drift.
We now developed the special government resolution on rules of behavior at stadiums.
After it is accepted, we closely will deal with this problem.
But I still will surely invite to myself all organizers of football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
The state supposedly give the law quicker.
Such feeling that is fans of "Bavaria" to Yaroslavl arrived and arranged all this.
And we are detached onlookers.
And in general it is awful - to see how the tribune is watered from a fire engine.
And it in the country which prepares for the World Cup.
"I have a feeling that we on 10-15 years ago returned", - Mutko told.
The lawyer with cocaine dependence who warned the leader of criminal group about police investigation, is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transferred information to criminal authority to Neil Skarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction will be opened
It was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the Liverpool royal court.
The prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about large police investigation because was afraid of exposure of the secret drug addiction, was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave to criminal authority to Neil Skarboro the classified information on investigation of its activities for a drug trafficking after it appeared under the threat because of the cocaine dependence.
The lawyer who got a nickname Bash and nicknamed among criminals "the cool lawyer" was arrested at home in 2011 after police operation on shadowing Scarborough of which it represented in the court connected with drugs earlier.
Officers noticed how 32-year Scarborough left three bags with cocaine at the house of the lawyer in the city of Blackburn of the County of Lancashire while that was during a dinner of association of lawyers with colleagues.
The consequence opened that Ditta "regularly used" class A drug after tests showed cocaine traces in his hair, on its wallet and on credit cards.
Within eight months from January to August, 2011 he tried to receive illegally information on arrests of two people at the request of Scarborough, and also one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under supervision of police within large-scale investigation of activity of the criminal organization for sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and the Western Yorkshire at this time.
They and 32 more persons were imprisoned later after the police withdrew during a series of raids heroin and cocaine for the sum of £1,5 million and also more than £200 thousand cash.
42-year-old Ditta told information to criminals because of fear that its cocaine dependence will be opened.
Today in the Liverpool royal court of Ditt which works in law firm of Forbes Solicitors which is in Blackburn it was disgraced after recognition of his guilt in two cases of intended hindrance to implementation of justice following the results of three-week court in the Liverpool Court of a crown.
He admitted storage of cocaine on one of the previous court sessions.
Exposure of the lawyer happened after the police investigating activity of Scarborough found out that he regularly spoke from Ditt by phone since February, 2011.
Two detectives tracked the suspect and found how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 percent purity in a black glove for golf under dustbins of the lawyer.
Soon after the Scarborough broadcast repeatedly called up from Ditt who Ivud Park of the Blackburn Rovers team was during a dinner at football stadium.
The lawyer came back home behind drugs; between them nine talk took place.
The court learned that Ditta "regularly took" cocaine after tests found class A drug traces in his hair, a purse and on its credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later, however denied the cocaine use, told that talked to the suspected dealer as that was his client, and insisted that their communication is "lawyer secret".
During the detention of Ditt took the wallet and tried to take out some credit cards, however all of them were confiscated, the sample of hair was also taken from it.
On interrogation in police it told that along with a workplace, it had both a house office, and clients came to it home on legal affairs.
However the court knew that after important arrests it called the largest participants of a drug trafficking which row it represented in court earlier to tell that detectives know about them.
In an accusatory speech of Ann Whyte told: "If someone also knows that it is not necessary to break the law, this is the lawyer on criminal cases".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abuse of the position of the lawyer on criminal cases as he entered too close relations with certain clients.
Contact about which we speak — it not simply the drug dealer, and the drug dealer supplying with drugs of the own lawyer.
Some of his talk, certainly, will be lawful as he was their lawyer.
However it substantially overstepped the limits of the usual relations of the lawyer and the client.
It interfered with police investigation so strongly as it is possible to allow these persons to continue the criminal activity.
Mr. Ditta did not honor the profession, and dishonored it.
He too approached with certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed to doubt the disinterest.
Ditta did not admit guilt and declared: "If I was the corrupted lawyer whom I am not, and would like to transfer information to Mr. of Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would make it immediately".
But after a meeting the senior officer Li Holsted from police of Lancashire declared: "Mr. Ditta turned from the lawyer on criminal cases into the criminal as soon as started getting drugs at representatives of organized crime".
Its addiction to cocaine made it hopelessly compromised and vulnerable for the main participants of criminal groups who charged to it to get valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers have to follow the royal standards of professional ethics and inspire in society trust and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to be covered with the profession.
Investigation in the matter of Mr. Ditt conducted division of Lancashire on especially dangerous organized crime which already achieved for it a sentence in three cases of storage of cocaine, and now also on hindrance to justice implementation, showing our aspiration to achieve fair punishment for criminals.
Let this business will serve as the prevention for criminals that nobody is out of reach of the law.
We will find you and we will bring to judicial responsibility.
Scarborough was condemned for 14 years after recognition of the fault in arrangement to the purpose of supply of heroin, cocaine and marihuana.
35 more people participating in fraud in the sum were sentenced to 153 years for the crimes connected with drugs.
On the site of Ditt organized conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he says that work of his dream — is the lawyer representing clients with the death sentence in America, the ideal partner for it at supper — Muhammad Ali, and motivation in work — this inequality.
Producers of jet planes are at enmity concerning seat width, when on a game big orders
Between the leading producers of planes fierce dispute concerning width of seats of a tourist class on distant flights inflamed, setting the tone for fierce confrontation at the Dubai aviation exhibition this month.
Dispute spins round width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to passengers of economy class, whose interests not always are in the center of attention of airlines, thus that the volume of the space allocated for them plays a key role in statements about efficiency of the last planes offered Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for introduction of the industry standard which would provide seat width not less than 18 inches (46 cm) in salons of economy class, but her main American competitor of Boeing says that airlines have to solve it.
Dispute goes when producers of planes compete on sales of more and more large versions of the two-engined long-haul planes, and on action potentially record orders are expected on November 17-21.
Configuration of back part of the plane — especially, whether 9 or 10 people in a row sit — takes the central place in statements for economic efficiency of new projects of "mini-airbuses".
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accomodate 406 people, proceeding from seats in economy class more than 17 inches in width placed on 10 in each row.
Airbus says that the competing version of its A350 will transport in economy class of 350 people on the seats 18 inches wide rowed on 9.
Giants of aircraft construction often exchange blows to technical questions by means of advertizing in the professional press.
And now Airbus addresses directly to the public before an air show in Dubai where 777X, as expected, will become the leader with more than 100 orders.
It showed recently what can be the beginning of new advertizing war, having shown to financiers the slide representing three people at restaurant pressed to each other under the name "You would agree on it?"
"Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats of narrower, than at regional turbo-propeller planes" — the head of sales of Airbus John Likhi told.
With change of a food allowance people gain weight, but plane seats cardinally did not change.
Between the beginning of the 1970th when widebody Boeing 747 set standards of modern distant travel, and a turn of century the weight of the average American man aged from 40 till 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to Department of health care of the USA.
The grasp of a waist of the average American man of the 21st eyelid makes 39,7 inches, according to statistical data of a health service of the USA.
Airbus claims that her competitor adheres to the concept of seats of the 1950th years when the average grasp of a waist of those who was called by "jet public" recently, was already.
Airbus says that ordered the research testifying that the additional inch in width of a seat improves quality of a dream for 53 percent.
Boeing challenges Airbus figures by the sizes of seats and says that producers should not interfere with decisions how to airlines to find balance between tariffs and conveniences.
According to her, researches show that convenience of salon depends not only on seat width.
"Everything actually is reduced to granting to airlines a choice and opportunity to do that in their opinion they have to make for achievement of success" — the expert of Boeing in salons Kent Kreyver told.
They do not want that we decided for them that will make for them profit.
They know the business better, than someone else.
For passengers the question consists in increase in space on each side, but for suppliers it even more often becomes a factor which can influence profit.
Behind this dispute there is a race behind orders for the planes estimated at least at $700 billion at the catalog prices in the next decades — there is enough to change a ratio of the American and European export.
As for the first time reported in July Reuters agency, an arrangement of seats — it that warms up rivalry in fight between the latest jet planes.
Both Airbus, and Boeing declare 20 percent increase of profitability on one place in their latest two-engined long-haul models in comparison with the leader of the market in this segment, 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER.
The declared characteristics of Boeing are partially based on comparison of 10-seater ranks 777X with original 9-seater configuration of ranks of the constructive decision 777.
The prize in specific prime cost decreases when comparing with 10-seater configuration, now in use.
"The reason for which Boeing does it, consists in squeezing more places and to make the plane more competitive in comparison with our development" — Kevin Keniston, the head of department of comfort of passengers of Airbus in Europe told.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with complete 10-seater series for existing the 777th specify that many passengers prefer dense seating which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
"Seats eighteen inches wide would be ideal for passengers, but reality such is that from the commercial point of view the Airbus offer is caused by threat from the 777th model" — the specialist in an interior of salon Mary Kirby, the founder and the Runway Girl Network editor told.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver a chair, but offer the catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The sellers of jet planes traveling all over the world even carry with themselves roulettes to check the competing plannings.
Praising highly comfort, all manufacturers also offer planes with very dense configuration of salon for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-seater ranks, but says that it still did not sell it.
Until recently Airbus emphasized need of additional modifications of salons, offering wider places at pass on some of the planes.
Without support of the only other producer of large modern planes as experts speak, her appeal to the new industry standard "will hardly "fly up", but can distract attention from a wave of sales of model 777X.
Oleynikov: third of the rural settlements of Moscow area the completely subsidized
The vice governor of Moscow area Yury Oleynikov declared that nearly a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
In total grants from the budget of the region receive 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013 187 settlements from 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
Specific weight of grants in the volume of the income of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - absolutely subsidized.
Within the budgetary security from the regional budget about 25 billion rubles go", - Oleynikov told.
Also the vice governor noted that only at three city settlements - Mytischi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the volume of the income of the budget makes more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Income of rural settlements of many areas less than 3 million rubles, "it is not enough at all".
Maintenance costs of local administrative facilities in 88 settlements of Moscow area are made by over 70%, "thus decline in quality of services is observed", Oleynikov noted.
Earlier he charged to heads of municipalities of Moscow area to think out November, what settlements need integration, association to city districts or change of system of administrative management.
These offers will be fulfilled by the end of January.
Before the governor of the Moscow region declared that within administrative reform in Moscow area is planned to reduce number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhaisk, Kashirsky, Solnechnogorsky, Kolomna areas, Lyubertsy and Kotelnikakh is request for integration of municipalities.
Discussion of this question in the cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
The chairman of Moscow regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov declared also that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow region plan to unite all within the future admreforma.
It is connected by that from 178 rural settlements in Moscow area less than a third have the "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidized.
The concern on safety in Mozambique increases owing to the conflict of influential people
Under Samora Mashel's statue looking at them from top to down, the president-founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the Maputo center to chant slogans about the world on one of demonstrations rare here.
"We want return of the world; we want stability" — Vanessa told de Sousse, the executive director of investment company.
Being afraid for the future of the country, it replaced a business suit with the t-shirt decorated with an inscription "We demand safety" in Portuguese, and joined on Thursday crowd at capital Square of Independence.
Within two weeks almost daily messages on collisions between government troops and Renamo arrived — these are one of the most cruel skirmishes since a truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo once was the known insurgent movement which was supported at first by the white authorities of Rhodesia, and then the government of apartheid era of South Africa within efforts on destabilization of the independent government of the country.
After a truce of 1992 it became opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country hardly again will come down to the full-scale conflict, however recent events forced to be fidgety foreign investors and locals.
Rates are high for fast-growing economy as opening of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal fields in the northwest can attract more than $50 billion as investments into the following some years from such companies as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo's party accuse each other of the created intensity.
Renamo's party claims that the government became the instigator of the last collisions, having attacked her members in Sofal's province, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
Attacks on the former insurgents then became aggravated when government troops attacked Renamo's bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakama — the leader of group, reported to the Financial Times newspaper of Fernando Mazanga, the representative Renamo.
The government blames Renamo for initiation of collisions, accusing party of attack on soldiers.
The president Armando Guebuza tried to dispel fears concerning instability.
Guebuza declared AFP, to the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt the "loser" who wanted to use "everything that remained from his forces to try to prove that he can impose to the government own decisions".
Both Frelimo, and Renamo insist that wars want to avoid.
However fears grew after the message that Mazanga declared Renamo's refusal of the peace agreement of 1992.
He reported Financial Times that meant non-compliance with the agreement by party of Frelimo.
"Our purpose - to return to negotiations, but with all gravity" — told Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between parties made for easing of intensity which was increased by a series of collisions this year a little.
"It is two influential persons (Guebuza and Dkhlakama) who faced foreheads" — Joseph Hanlon, the lecturer of Open university and the expert in Mozambique told.
Any of them is not the good negotiator and any of them is not ready to make necessary concessions.
The party of Renamo which tries to achieve selective reforms, already declared that she will boycott the municipal elections appointed to November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as attempt of the weakened movement to get concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of voices for Renamo decreases since 1992 whereas new party — the Democratic movement of Mozambique (MDM) which is based by the former member Renamo, as expected, improves the indicators on these elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza who has to resign next year when its second term ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want the world because he does not want to leave the president's post" — told Mazanga.
Not clearly, what opportunities Renamo possesses, however it already carried out destructive and prompt attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway conducting with the North on the South.
The majority of skirmishes took place in Sofal's province which is in several hundred kilometers to the North from Maputo, but includes Beira — port which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June of Rio suspended use of railway tracks approximately for a week after Renamo threatened with attack on the railroad.
Mazanga it was evasive when asked it a question of, whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo's party wanted "to warn the international community that affairs in Mozambique go not really well", – told Mazanga.
Instability strengthened discontent with the government, and many people are also excited by corruption, slow rate of development and kidnappings which became frequent recently, speaks Fernando Lim, the head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
"People think that responsibility for the future of the country bear the government and the president who has to find the solution of these problems" — he speaks.
Omar Sultuan, the demonstrator, told that people simply want stability.
"Nobody is excited by neither Renamo, nor Frelimo, they simply want renewal of the world, they want a free access to roads" — he told.
Instructions for use electronic devices on aircrafts in Australia meanwhile will remain in force
Passengers of the Australian airlines will need and to switch off further the tablets and smartphones during take off and landing, despite measures in the USA for mitigation of the rules concerning these devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration of the USA allowed the American carriers to change the procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, watch video or play games on the devices during take off and landing provided that those will remain in "The flight mode".
Passengers can already do it during the main part of flight, but many irritates that they have no access to the electronic books during take off and landing.
The Australian carriers consider this decision which demanded from the American airlines to carry out a huge number of work for compliance to new requirements, but specified that they do not plan to change the procedures in the near future.
In Management of safety of flights of civil aviation also noted that they consider this application, but emphasized that restrictions on use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight still ​​ work in Australia.
"Management of safety of flights of civil aviation has no the special rules regulating use of electronic devices in planes" now — it declared.
The matter is regulated by rules which demand from air carriers to provide safety maintenance at any time, and from passengers — to follow safety rules about which they are reported by crew members.
The Virgin company which already discussed with Management of safety of flights of civil aviation expansion of use onboard the entertaining system with Wi-Fi, was not against changes, but declared that it will follow indications of the regulator.
"We would welcome consideration by Management of safety of flights of civil aviation of a question of permission of use of electronic devices because we really think that it will improve quality of customer service now when it (onboard wireless entertaining system) is by our planes" — the press secretary told.
Qantas declared that will adhere to the rules existing at the moment.
"Our present policy consists that electronic devices cannot be used during take off and landing, and soon we do not plan it to change" — she declared.
The resolution FAU extends on the American airlines.
Nevertheless we are always interested in regulatory changes which could bring benefit to passengers, and we, certainly, will attentively study the solution of FAU and reason, caused it.
For carriers of the USA influence of the resolution will vary from airline to airline and will depend on age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their planes possess resistance to a radio noise from mobile devices, and also to reconsider grants, training materials, norms on transportation of hand luggage and the instruction for passengers.
"After the airline will check and will confirm a noise stability of the fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic books and smartphones, at any height" — declared FAU.
In rare instances poor visibility the crew will instruct passengers to switch off the devices in a landing time.

Obama refuses the words about health care

Yesterday Obama corrected the initial public promise a little.
"Most of the people having the health insurance which works can keep it" — he told in the performance in Boston.
Concerning that he called "revival in news" concerning the termination of rendering services, Obama urged the Americans receiving these notices to look for other options in the market.
Most of people will have opportunity to receive the best, comprehensive plans of medical insurance at the same price or even cheaper, than was predicted.
"You receive more favorable conditions" — he told.
The administration declared that has to surprise nobody that 5% of the population which buy an insurance independently, can be compelled to replace plans because their covering does not conform to the new standards necessary according to the law on available medical care.
"Allow me to tell directly to these Americans: you deserve the best" — Sibelius in performance before committee on power and trade of the House of Representatives in Washington told.

"I am upset and annoyed as well as everything — she told.
— I very much want to return your trust".
The angry Sibelius dropped this phrase which was caught by the included microphone, to the assistant sitting behind it at yesterday's hearings in chamber after hot debate with the member of the House of Representatives Billey Long, the State of Missouri republican, about, whether she is obliged to enter the program of health care of Obama.
After more than three hours of hearings Long once again insistently asked to tell Sibelius why "architect" of the law on available medical care voluntary did not refuse the insurance sponsored by the government for acquisition of the plan through HealthCare.gov which she imposes to millions of Americans now.

Koulson resorted to breaking of phone for check of a confidential message
The former editor of the News of the World newspaper Andy Koulson allegedly used "breaking of phone, shadowing and opposition" in attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clark holding a post of the Minister of Internal Affairs at that moment.
The accuser, the royal lawyer Andrew Edis reported to Old-Bailey's court that in May, 2005 the News of the World newspaper received doubtful news that Clark meets the "an attractive special sovetnitsa" Hanna Polbi.
The newspaper charged to the private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to crack voice mail of Polbi and trapped her at the house to interview, but also Koulson too called it and left voice messages — heard court.
"Charge considers that Mr. Koulson who now is NotW editor — it is not such person who will stand near someone's house, hoping to take someone unawares, he is the person who likes to offer history to people to see that they will tell" — Mr. Edis told.
He told that the News of the World newspaper used three ways of investigation of stories: breaking of phones, shadowing and opposition.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about shadowing, he simply has to.
What about the first?
Whether he knows about breaking of phones?
He says that is not present, we speak: "Oh, yes!"
Hearings about Clark's novel for the first time drew attention to edition to News of the World when the source which is sexually interested in Mrs. Polbi was told: "Do not spend time, it with Charles".
The cartridge with the voice messages received from its phone at least three times was withdrawn from Mulkeyr's house in August of the 2006th.
Investigators also found records on the computer of the private detective in which Ms. Polbi and her sister appeared as "Projects".
Throughout the period when it was under shadowing, the grandmother and the grandfather of Mrs. Polbi received anonymous calls with requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis told.
At this time the being chief reporter Nevill Tyorlbek and the former reporter James Uezerap controlled shadowing movement of Mrs. Polbi.
Having left it a voice message on June 18 the 2005th, Koulson told: "I have a history which we plan to publish tomorrow and which I very much would like to discuss with Charles".
Mr. Edis told that Koulson's participation in this history happened according to the same scenario, as to other influential people, for example to the former Minister of Internal Affairs David Blankett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Koulson entered confrontation with Mr. Blankett concerning the affair with the married woman while he met sootvetchitsy Rebecca Brooks who was at that time married.
Koulson and Brooks deny the introduction in arrangement to other people for the purpose of breaking of phones during the period from October 3, 2000 to August 9, 2006.
Mulkeyr, Tyorlbek and Uezerap admitted breaking of phones.
In bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no Brotherly Circle group as which in the USA ranked Leps
In databases of the Russian security officers of Brotherly Circle group as which Washington ranked the singer Grigory Leps, it does not appear.
As noted to "Interfax" in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation after in mass media there were messages on entering by the U.S. Treasury Department of Grigory Leps into check lists on suspicion in belonging to the Euroasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle", all databases were checked, but such group it was revealed not.
Distribution of this information promotes maintenance of the myth about so-called "the Russian mafia" which allegedly works abroad, consider in power structures.
"Even in the name - 'The brotherly circle', is a certain element of mystery, the hint on a secret box contains.
"All this is very similar to a PR action", - the interlocutor of agency told.
The U.S. Treasury Department declared on October 31 entering in the check lists on suspicion in belonging to the Euroasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle" of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The persons entered in this list are suspected of collaboration with a certain Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov which are considered as influential members of criminal groups and are in sanctions lists of the USA since February, 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as the courier for delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev".
In a production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on charges of the USA to the singer, having called them "nonsense".
In 2011 the U.S. President Barack Obama carried Brotherly Circle syndicate to number of "essential transnational organized criminal groups" and charged to the Ministry of Finance "to undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations".
Entering of the person in black lists of the American Ministry of Finance involves blocking of its assets to the USA and a ban on business contacts with it of the persons living in the States.
Scientists shed light how the movements of a tail of a dog are connected with her mood.
Earlier researches showed that happy dogs wag a tail to the right side (from the point of view of a dog) while alarmed dogs wag with a tail mainly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other representatives of family of the psovy can notice these subtle differences in wagging by a tail and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, the neurobiologist from Trentsky university, speaks: "It is well known that at people the left and right parties of a brain differently participate in formation of pobuditel who cause positive or negative emotions".
Here we tried to look at it and at other types.
He added that the same as at the person, at dogs the right part of a brain controls the left side of a body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more how dogs react to versatile povilivaniye of tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of heartbeat of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Possibly, we will understand already soon why their tails sometimes go to one party, and sometimes — in another
Professor Vallortigara told: "We showed to dogs of video with dogs — either naturalistic versions, or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of a tail and direct a tail more to the left or to the right".
When animals saw that for the rest nothing the expressing dog moved a tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog wagging a tail), they remained absolutely weakened.
But when they noticed that the tail inclined mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog wagging a tail), their heartbeat became frequent and they looked alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara told that he does not think that dogs intentionally communicated with each other with the help of these movements.
Actually he considers that dogs learned from the experience, about what movements they should worry, and about what — no.
He notices: "If there are some meetings with other dogs and often wagging of their tail in one party are connected with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience".
Researchers say that these results can yield to owners, veterinarians and trainers deeper understanding of emotions of the animal.
The expert in the field of behavior of dogs John Bradshaw, the invited research associate at veterinary school of University of Bristol, told that it was not the first research for check of, whether the left and right parties have value for dogs.
Last year the group of scientists of university of the Lincoln found out that dogs turn the heads to the left if look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if look at a happy dog.
And in other scientific work of university of the Victoria in Canada it reported: "Dogs approached a thicket a dog robot when wagging of her tail went to the left, but not to the right instead of becoming alarmed — opposite behavior in relation to the Italian research".
He told that distinctions could be because dogs in various researches not completely perceived animals in movies or dogs robots as dogs.
There could be useful a research of how dogs react to the real dogs, he explained.
"While on various mammals there are enough certificates of that two hemispheres of a brain are used for various purposes, many details still it is necessary to specify, and dogs not an exception" — he told.
However, considering that ease with which their behavior probably can be registered already soon we will understand why their tails sometimes go to one party, and sometimes — in another.
Whether the elite of Europe is ready to do business with England?
Campaign of Business for Britain was started in April with the obligation to bring together representatives of business and to define, what changes founders of welfare and workplaces of Great Britain want to see in the relations with the EU.
For this purpose we ordered the biggest and fullest poll of the British business leaders, having asked them to introduce the ideas of Great Britain, business and the EU.
The YouGov company interrogated more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide cut of business in Great Britain by the sizes, sectors and regions.
Conclusions of poll will appear surprise for many.
We found out that the vast majority of the enterprises looks for possibilities of export out of limits of Europe now, paying special attention to the countries which carry out modernization and grow while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want that the government gave a priority to new commercial relations with such countries as China, India and Brazil, but did not spend time for long and difficult process of reforming of the confused EU institutes.
When they were asked about their views of specific political affairs, from antimonopoly regulation to laws on production, most of business leaders considered that control of these key spheres of competence has to be returned to Westminster.
There was the general discontent with the uniform market, and representatives of business declared that costs from regulation from Brussels now outweigh advantages from stay in a trade zone of Europe — 40 percent of the large enterprises, traditionally most of a proyevropeyska adjusted from all companies agreed with it even.
The last and the most indicative — our poll of heads of business revealed that the obvious majority wants that Great Britain conducted a course of change of the contract and for the relations with the EU based on trade, but not on policy.
This result which was observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business insists on "significant change" which will return powers back to Great Britain.
Rates are high — achievement of changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for Great Britain will provide 16 percent shift in vote remaining in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the British business supports its plan of revision of conditions of membership of Great Britain in the EU.
It also shows that business expects that revision will lead to considerable shift in the current balance of forces back towards Great Britain.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and become more and more necessary as the eurozone takes a way of closer economic and financial association.
The priority has to be given to workplaces and economic growth in Great Britain, and as show results of our poll, it means the strengthened concentration of attention on trade for business and fundamental changes in standard activity of Brussels.

In Siberia you should not be a vegan: the hothouse tomato will not replace soup
Why the vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
The people who completely refused products of an animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here to them not to transfer winter without loss for health, and no hothouse tomatoes compensate them, the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interrogated on the eve of Day of the vegan consider.
To drink oil in liters
The strict vegetarianism when refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However dietitians are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in food, at least, insalubriously for health.
Full refusal of animal products is harmful.
Animal protein contains irreplaceable amino acids which are very difficult for compensating the vegetable.
It is necessary to include in a diet at least milk or eggs", - the nutritionist Marina Bogay is sure.
It cites as an example the fish containing irreplaceable Omega-3 fatty acid.
The richest with it vegetable oil - linen.
"To consume it in quantities, necessary for the person, it is necessary to drink in liters!" - the nutritionist speaks.
Physicians are sure that inhabitants of Siberia need to pay special attention to a diet in the winter.
During this season the vegetarianism is especially called into question.
In the conditions of our realities great demands are made of food.
Not to freeze, the increased caloric content is necessary.
"If the person limits himself on animal products, respectively, this caloric content he does not gather additionally", - the expert speaks.
The dietitian Olga Poznyak agrees with it.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruit - not an exit.
It is better for person to feed mainly on products which are grown up in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is adjusted on the best assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in the winter people do not want not a cucumber pogryzt, and hot soup or still something posytny", - the doctor explains the position.
According to her, from this, that vegans can eat, various cereals, grain, bean, local vegetables, apples remaining at winter, the frozen berries are rather useful.
But it, unambiguously, it is not enough for good nutrition.
According to the gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians in organisms have a level of vitamins sufficient only from the middle of August on the middle of September.
Full transition to vegetarianism in our rigid environment when temperature can change in days on 30 degrees and in May snow lies, is inexpedient.
The organism for life needs energy, and it, first of all, fat", - is stated by the physician.
Doctors note that the veganstvo is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need construction material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them the defective.
Pregnant women also need the increased protein content, vitamins and microcells in the menu.
"Veganki them is received less", - Bogay is sure.
Arifulina says that the adult is free to choose anything, "to play those toys which wants".
It has already created organism, a skeleton, bodies.
And children nevertheless have to eat fully.
If parents deprive of it any microcells or amino acids, choosing for it that he will eat, it is simple violation of the rights of the child.
"Tomorrow you will not restore a lack of these or those substances for development of a brain, sight, bones any more", - she speaks.
All interrogated medical specialists agree in opinion on low quality of the grown-up in the winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruit.
That bring to us and grown up in greenhouses, contains smaller quantity of microcells necessary for us, than (grown up) in an open ground.
"Quality of products not that", - speaks Bogay.
Arifulina also notes that imported and hothouse vegetables and fruit are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to reap a bigger crop causes damage to quality.
"Apples do not become brown on a cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and grow mouldy, tomatoes tasteless and not fragrant", - the physician gives examples, adding that they, most likely, are stuffed with excessive amount of fertilizers.
Also become suppliers not of vitamins, and cellulose.
The Head of Laboratory of the Siberian physics and technology institute of agrarian problems, the candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk does not agree with it.
She says that at the correct approach and observance of all norms and requirements in greenhouses cultivation of full-fledged vegetables is possible.
If try to expel more from square meter, of course, and will begin to water to a thicket, and to overfeed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too much nitric fertilizers, tomatoes quickly grow, they large, but watery and unsweetened", - she explains, adding that the quality question, first of all, depends conscience on the producer.
Russia out of fight for pollution of the cities cars
Attempts to solve transport problems of the large cities were observed in the majority of megalopolises of the world since the second half of the XX century.
As a rule, it was talked or of their reorganization and expansion of highways, or of attempts to reduce demand for automobile trips, number of cars and time of their use.
The example of Singapore where rigid quoting of a gain of number of private cars is entered is widely known, and the right of their acquisition is bought at auctions.
Its price can exceed the price of the car by two-three times.
The European cities, including London, entered a payment for entrance to the downtown.
In Germany, for example in Hamburg and Stuttgart, enter so-called green zones where entrance only is allowed cars with the certain ecoclass using also quality fuel (including biofuel or electric cars).
The agency of environment protection of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 "the five-year plan of clean air" in the total cost about 250 billion yuans (about $40 billion).
As told "Kommersant" the director of department of control of transport pollution of municipal bureau of environment protection of Beijing Li Kunsheng, a main goal of a five-years period - decrease in the leading pollutants of air by 20-35% by 2017, growth of number of private cars to the level which is not exceeding 6 million (now 5,2 million), and also increase no more than for 5% of use of fuel counting on one vehicle.
According to agency, now motor transport in Beijing is responsible for 22,5% of the general air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program - restriction of use of the motor transport, and also introduction of surtaxes for car owners.
In addition, city measures of "a green five-years period" include the transition to fuel European standards accelerated in comparison with other country, introduction of local system of ecostandards and marking of cars and fuel, restriction on entrance of cars to the central part of the city, a ban on use of outdated vehicles (besides, creation of incentive financial programs of replacement of old cars on hybrid or electric cars), development of electrotransport (including public and office), development of public transport (including high-speed).
The ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the People's Republic of China their six) one day in a week (the relevant information contains in registration plate of the vehicle), and also delivery of registration signs for cars on the basis of a lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of action of a lottery, the total of permissions to registration of private cars in Beijing made only a third of number of 2010) is also among automobile innovations of Beijing.
According to the existing "Environmental Protection for 2012-2020" state program, the number of the cities with high and very high air pollution has to be reduced to 128 (in their 2012 was 138).
According to Ministry for Protection of the Environment and Natural Resources, in 2011 on "mobile sources" 41% of all emissions of the polluting substances in the atmosphere of the cities fell.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars exceed industrial, and in St. Petersburg - by nine times ten times.
In the Russian Federation so far only start reflecting on opportunities of restrictive regulation of cars on streets of the cities.
The director of Institute of transport economics and transport policy of VShE Mikhail Blinkin considers that the administrative and fiscal measures directed on suppression of demand for automobile trips - business obviously unpopular, they can be accepted by society only on condition of their total universality.
In case of Moscow there is a unique problem connected with structure of its vehicle fleet where there are two clusters poorly sensitive to any regulatory to influences - official and personal cars, and also cars of "exclusive" users which total number makes not less than 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of vehicle fleet of Moscow).
The other day urbanists from the WHAT center in St. Petersburg prepared research where the balance of urban areas between a housing estate, the area of a paving and quantity of motor transport is analyzed.
Main conclusions of researchers: the downtown is provided with roads twice smaller demanded, and most of the motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time on parkings or it is simple on streets.
It is as a result offered to build not parkings, but storage of cars, not to expand, and to reduce the carriageway (streets became more friendly for pedestrians), and also to limit use and placement of an individual transport in borders of the territory of a security zone of historic center (the general territory about 3212 hectares covering a number of the central regions of the city).
Will lead tax maneuver which provides increase of a tax on mining (MET) on oil at the same time with decrease in export duties and increase of excises to a rise in price of fuel.
According to experts, these measures can bring additional 619,3 billion rubles in the budget.
Trip on dirt, the rivers and the jungle for rendering free medical care
Doctor George Bvelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bvelle and his team carry out almost every weekend, accepting hundreds of patients
In this West African country of doctors there is not a lot of — only one on 5000 people
Vote here or via your mobile device
Doctor George Bvelle — one of 10 main heroes of CNN of 2013.
You can vote for it or for any of other 10 main characters that he became the Hero of year of CNN.
This person will receive $250 000 for continuation of the outstanding work.
During 21 year George Bvelle saw how his father was restored to life and again fell into an unconsciousness, wandering on hospitals which were not equipped properly to help it.
Dzhamef Bvelle was traumatized in road accident in 1981 near Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon.
At first at it the hand was only broken, but the arisen infection extended on a brain and caused a hematoma which reminded of itself until the end of life.
"In Cameroon there were no neurosurgeons — George Bvelle told.
If we had money, we would take out it from Cameroon.
Instead of this Bvelle accompanied for years the father in the crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment which they could receive.
"It is hard — Bvelle told.
— You can leave the house in the 5th mornings, come running in hospital to be the first, but you not the first.
There is a lot of patients.
Some can die because they should wait.
The situation not strongly changed since the father Bvelle died in 2002.
According to World Health Organization, in Cameroon only one doctor on 5000 people.
For comparison, a ratio in the United States — one doctor on 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could address to the doctor, it would be too expensive for much of them.
Two of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of expenses on health care in it are private.
"Their only problem is poverty — Bvelle told.
— And because of poverty they cannot enjoy the life".
Seeing sufferings of the father and his very many compatriots, Bvelle was filled determination something with it to make.
Last year doctor George Bvelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and works as the vascular surgeon in the Central hospital Yaounde.
It also founded ASCOVIME non-profit organization which will organize trips to rural areas on days off for providing free medical care.
Since 2008 it and its group of volunteers gave help of nearly 32 000 people.
Nearly an every Friday it and to 30 people jam in vans, tie medical belongings to roofs and go on a cross-country terrain to visit the villages needing the help.
Not always they are accompanied by good luck.
More than once they had to push cars through the rivers and dirt.
But when they come, them meet, as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms what locals can only offer.
The free medical care in these villages really is a reason for a holiday, and Bvelle with his wide smile and boundless energy more than is happy to join fun.
The next morning the crew starts accepting hundreds of patients.
"We accept 500 people on each trip" — Bvelle told.
They come with all the district in a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these clinics of the day off provides various medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and diseases, sexually transmitted.
Others can receive crutches, the offered points or free birth certificates — the documents necessary for school which many poor families simply are not able to afford.
In the evenings the crew performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are, as a rule, performed in the building of school, municipality or in the house; after procedure patients get up and go to a postoperative zone to release a place for the following person.
Using the generator for publicizing of operational and sanitary processing of the equipment, Bvelle and his volunteers work till early morning of Sunday.
It is excessive speed, but rural musicians usually help to maintain commitment of crew.
"They all night long beat the drum that we were awake and continued to work" — Bvelle told.
On Sunday members of crew go back to the city, tired, but proud of the work.
This group consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students performed 700 free operations for last year, and they know that their help can have huge value for those to whom they help.
One person explained that the free operation on treatment of hernia received by him will allow it to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family" — the man told.
In addition to these clinical receptions in days off and work in hospital as the surgeon Bvelle also works at the nights in private medical clinics round Yaounde.
This second work, according to him, provides 60% of financing of its non-profit organization; other means become covered at the expense of private donations.
"I do not even know when he sleeps" — Cathie O'Malley, the medical student of the second year of Drekselsky university in Philadelphia, the volunteer in group Bvelle told.
He always or in hospital, or tries to earn money for the organization that it was possible to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the USA and Europe to join Bvella in realization of his tasks, is opportunity of practice which they never had at home.
"We had an opportunity to assist on operations where we helped to delete spots of blood or to hold tools for doctor Bvelle" — O'Malley told.
Being the student second-year student, you would never receive such opportunity in America.
Students volunteers usually pay the journey to Cameroon, often arriving with the offered medicines.
But on arrival in Yaounde their food, transport and training pays by Bvelle.
"He is a hero, undoubtedly" — O'Malley told.
It gives the life of this organization, and his desire to help people of Cameroon infinitely.
For Bvelle almost constant load work is not a heartrending experience.
To help to lead happy life to another, to keep the promise made to the father — it that brings it big joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work — Bvelle told.
— And I think of my father.
I hope, he sees that I do.
I do it that people laughed to reduce their pain.

To "the Russian mafia" in the USA the new name - "A brotherly circle" was finally assigned
This week the black list of "the Russian mafia" in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department entered into "A brotherly circle" of three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and the Israeli.
The famous singer Grigory Leps whom the USA suspect of transportation of money for members of group appeared one of Russians.
In total in a black list of the USA 22 persons involved in "A brotherly circle", and six organizations affiliated with it.
Nevertheless many experts drop a hint of doubt that such organization really exists.
"The statement for 'A brotherly circle' resembles attempt to unite separate criminal groups" more, - the expert in organized crime and professor of University of New York Mark Galeotti declared earlier.
In his opinion, "The brotherly circle" reflects popular perception of "the Russian mafia".
"I did not meet anybody in the Russian law enforcement agencies or still somewhere who would confirm existence of such criminal organization", - quotes Mr. Galeotti the American Center for research of corruption and organized crime.
Professor of George Mason University Lise Shelley also agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
"If they also act together, it is more similar to a criminal network, but not the organization", - the Center for research of corruption and organized crime provides her words.
In the middle of last year Mark Galeotti suggested that "The brotherly circle" unites in a bigger measure of confidants of the Russian thief in law Aslan Usoyan known as Grandpa Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
So, Lasha Shushanashvili's activity and Zachariah Kalashova, filled up the list in 2012, was closely connected with Grandpa Hassan, and one more participant of the list, Temuri Mirzoyev, had to Grandpa Hassan the nephew.
Nevertheless Mr. Galeotti notes that some persons and have no relation to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united by rather common financial and criminal interests, for example supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile scandal over inclusion in "A brotherly circle" of Grigory Leps - the favourite singer of the president of Russia Vladimir Putin - drew attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we count that we will receive more detailed information in this connection such decision why it in such lists was entered was made from our American partner colleagues, - the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov told.
Anyway he (Leps) is the citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair told that he will use chance of return as the prime minister of Great Britain, but recognizes that return is improbable.
The night before in the interview devoted to the fifth anniversary of leaving from the post, the 59-year-old politician stated the opinion of various aspects of domestic policy.
From the moment of resignation in June, 2007, after ten years on the leader's post, Blair substantially avoided discussion of the British policy, limiting the majority of the comments to foreign affairs and the role of the ambassador in the four of Middle Eastern peacekeepers.
Answering a question, whether it returned to the prime minister's position, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, told: "Yes, of course, but hardly it happens, so..."
The head coach of "Milan" Massimiliano Allegri expressed a regret concerning neutral result in a match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with "Lazio".
The expert also noted that failures on start are caused by a series of injuries of the leading players.
It is a pity to me that we did not manage to win, - Allegri quotes Tmw.
The team played a sound match, having created 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time we allowed nothing to "Lazio".
In the second Romans added, but in general I cannot tell that we lost concentration.
It was necessary to win.
In last season we carried out a hit task in the Champions League.
Now we lag behind the schedule, but it is caused by the whole series of injuries of key football players.
Rami and Honda?
These are very good players, with character.
However our structure is also now good.
Look at Kaká who held a meeting at high level.
The British police hands to Assange the notice of delivery
The British police handed today the notice of delivery of the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange who took cover in Embassy of Ecuador in London and asked for asylum.
In Scotland Yard declared that they handed to the 40-year-old Australian "the official requirement to be given" with the requirement to be in a police station, having added that in case of non-performance of this requirement it will be subject further to arrest.
Assange is threatened by an extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes after he exhausted the opportunities according to the British law when the Supreme Court rejected its appeal on an extradition this month earlier.
Being afraid that Stockholm will transfer him to the USA, on June 19 it took cover in Embassy of Ecuador in London, having asked for this South American country of a political asylum.
Scotland Yard "handed to the 40-year-old man the official requirement to be given which obliges him to arrive to a police station in day and time at our choice" as the press secretary reported.
He still violates release conditions on the security.
The embassy refused to comment on delivery of the notification of police.
Assange is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the USA for presentation of possible charges of espionage to him after the publication more than 250 000 American diplomatic dispatches on the WikiLeaks website opposing privacy.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris on presentation of the novel "Eltyshev" translated to French.
Let's remind, its this novel became the finalist of four awards: "Yasnaya Polyana", "the Russian Booker", "The national best-seller" and "The big book".
And last year the writer for this book was awarded awards of the government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin - the undoubted leader in generation of present thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Practically each publication of his tough, constructed on modern vital material stories and stories causes hot discussions among critics of the most different directions.
It is possible to claim that the aggregated articles about prose and Senchin's journalism, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of the Russian literature since the end of the 1990th years prior to the beginning of the 2010th.
In discussions about works of "one of the most disputable modern writers", according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, mostly it is talked that its participants understand as the word "literature" what see the present and the future not only our literature, but also life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include in it the majority of articles and reviews of regional mass media and a blog sphere.
Analytical and reviews are given, as a rule, in reduction in the sections "Paragraphs"...
Snowden can be interrogated in Russia
The ex-employee of the American intelligence services Edward Snowden, most likely, will not leave out of borders of Russia for evidence on cases of the wiretap of telephone negotiations of the German chancellor Angela Merkel.
As declared to "Interfax" on Friday the source familiar with a situation, the American can answer questions of representatives of the State Office of Public Prosecutor of Germany in writing or internally in Russia.
Edward Snowden's departure out of borders of Russia is almost excluded.
"In this case it will lose the status of the refugee and can be given out to Washington by the countries - allies of the USA", - the interlocutor of agency told.
"At the same time, in principle, the State Office of Public Prosecutor of Germany could send the representatives to the Russian Federation or refer written matters to Snowden", - added a source, having added that this question has to be worked at interstate level.
Earlier the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Shtrebele reported that Edward Snowden is ready to give evidences on the case of the wiretap the American intelligence services of negotiations of the German chancellor.
Snowden is ready to give evidences to the German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow, or in the territory of Germany.
The ex-employee of CIA let know that knows a lot of things.
In spite of the fact that the U.S. NSA blocked all its movement, Snowden is ready to arrive to Germany.
However for this purpose it is necessary to define accurately all conditions of its arrival", - Shtrebele reported to Euronews TV channel.
Advocaat Snowden Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of a source of "Interfax", declared that his client can cooperate with the German investigators, but when and as - will solve.
The U.S. citizen Edward Snowden working for the National Security Agency (NSA) of the USA and CIA ran to Hong Kong in May, 2013 then published information on confidential operations of intelligence services of the USA on shadowing on the Internet.
Snowden flied through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because its passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities which in absentia brought him serious charges and prior to the beginning of August remained in a transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.
On the first of August Snowden received the document on granting provisional asylum to it in the territory of Russia for a period of a year and on the same day left "Sheremetyevo".
Yesterday the American's lawyer Anatoly Kucherena declared that his client got a job in "the large Russian company".
Last week reported the German mass media about shadowing of the NSA Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, Americans started listening to telephone negotiations of the chancellor in 2002.
The station of tracking allegedly was in the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The authorities of Germany after the publication of these data declared that shadowing Merkel breaks laws and the sovereignty of Germany.
It is declared release of the racing Land Rover series
Inside there are racing seats and six-dot seat belts, and also system of internal communication.
It is in addition possible to receive the modernized brakes, the package of services providing access to mechanics of Bowler Works, logistic support and storage of the car between actions.
Drew Bauler, the managing director of the Bowler Motorsport company, told: "The participants of rally addressing in Bowler exchanged".
Some of them not skilled racers, but people who are looking for disorders, adventures and access to actions of a world class.
We are glad to offer such way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and we consider that this format offers a new way to try various disciplines of rally in Great Britain and abroad, and also to prepare participants for severe conditions and realities of a rally raid.
We with great pleasure developed the Defender Challenge car — it will be really fascinating championship.
Besides, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and tests, and also opportunity to take part in actions in the desert in North Africa and in the Middle East.
Children have to study myths and legends as "models of a way of life", the author speaks.
Legends on the Torah could show that "the brute force cannot win against distinguished cunning", and legends of king Arthur show how it is important to have dream.
Saying that many myths will be "too wild, too scandalous and in certain cases too obscene for teaching at schools", Crossley-Holland supports "careful selection" of the texts suitable on age.
"I consider, it is wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education" — he told.
I supported their introduction to the program of training twenty years.
He added that "excessive moralising" of authors and teachers "fights interest" off children, and the main ideas "are sublimated" in fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland which was translated by "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon language, and also "The collection of the Norwegian myths" for Penguin and "British National Fairy Tales" publishing house wrote, told: "You, of course, can have intentions, but it is better for you to keep them around".
Probably, big difference between the adult author writing for adults, and the adult author writing for children is need to feel some hope.
That everything has to be simplified or lead not that to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there was a congenital understanding of the good and evil.
And it has to be sublimated; it is opened through history, but it is not accurately formulated.
Old principle: to show, but not to tell.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned about the growing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
It first of all crisis of non-payments on the poor consumer credits and mass reductions of workers.
Our main concern now - not that growth was slowed down, and it is rather, structure of this growth.
Recently it is completely caused by consumption which almost does not reduce turns", - the chief economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Graff declared, submitting the quarterly report of Investbank on the Russian economy yesterday.
Now the nominal growth of salaries in Russia - about 10%.
At inflation in 6% it will be able to provide future consumer demand approximately at the current level, expect in Goldman Sachs.
But profitability of the Russian companies falls therefore, most likely, they will be engaged in optimization of expenses on the personnel.
Today we see the essential growth of a share of salaries in GDP: if salaries grow for 10%, GDP - only for 2%, - Mr. Grafe explained.
The companies faced profitability reduction.
If she does not grow up, it can lead to dismissals and growth of unemployment.
The Russian business can raise wages, the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin comments.
Unemployment near historical minima, the competition for workers the high.
To entice employees from the party or to hold present, employers should raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported also by very rapid growth of consumer crediting.
According to Mr. Grafe, because of the highest rates on consumer loans of multiplicative effect this type of crediting does not render on national economy.
"We any did not see advantage for economy of consumer crediting growth, money does not disperse on economy, and comes back to the same banks in the form of percentage payments", - the economist told.
But a problem in other - in Goldman Sachs expect growth of delay on the poor credits.
They are taken by generally rather poor people who have nothing to provide in providing.
Percent on such loans the high.
As a result, do not return to their thicket", - Mr. Grafe noted.
Therefore the second threat to growth of economy in Russia - possible crisis of non-payments on the poor credits.
The director of the VShE Bank institute Vasily Solodkov already now sees signs of the becoming ripe bank crisis.
The small credit organizations, without having access to cheap resources what the State Banks have, were compelled to raise funds of the population under high percent.
In reply the State Banks came to a track of war and began to reduce credit rates, - the economist continues.
The small credit organizations cannot give out loans under the same percent, differently they will have a negative percentage margin.
If the State Banks do not refuse a dumping, Russia is threatened by full bank crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
In recent weeks the economist considers deprivation of licenses of a number of banks as a harbinger of mass crash.
"The State Banks will not cope with such situation: the deposit insurance system initially was not calculated on system crisis", - the head of institute warns.
But growth of consumption will be slowed down and without crisis of non-payments, believe in Investbank, - because of refusal of indexation of salaries of civil servants and military, put in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially the fall to consumption will be broken by a freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, decrease of the inflation rate).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and prerequisites to it are not present so far - see the reference), growth of consumption will all the same be slowed down, are sure of Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not see prerequisites for implementation of pessimistic scenarios yet.
"The main risk is still falling of price of oil", - he speaks.
By its assessment, the economy of Russia will start being reduced at the cost of oil lower than 90 dollars/barrel.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank yet not in forces to lower interest rates in economy.
The paradoxical picture is observed: inflation decreased, and banks began to increase rates.
It can mean that they did not believe the Central Bank which declared transition to inflation targeting", - Clemens Graff told.
The percentage policy of the Central Bank does not influence market rates, influences only rates of interbank crediting.
"For the Central Bank it is crash of all hopes", - Clemens Graff estimated.
The money received at auctions of the Central Bank uses banks not for crediting of economy, and for management of the liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes at once, it means that means try to leave on speculation against ruble.
"Sooner or later the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work", - Mr. Grafe told and reminded that the state plans to start up ruble in "free swimming" by the end of 2015.
But it is necessary or to make it earlier, or to increase a key rate of the Central Bank (5,5%), he considers.
By its assessment, ruble exchange rate is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
I cut only one road - to weaken, - the expert draws a conclusion.
But if the Central Bank arouses in financiers though a doubt shadow that elimination of a currency corridor is not part of policy onto weakening of ruble, it can bring down ruble much more strongly.
Snowden agreed to give evidences about Merkel's wiretap
The deputy of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele met to Moscow Edward Snowden.
Whether during conversation the question was discussed Snowden as the witness by the State Office of Public Prosecutor of Germany on the case of possible tapping of the phone of the German chancellor of a spetssltsuzhbama of the USA can be interrogated.
Snowden expressed readiness to give necessary evidences.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow, or in Germany.
He accurately let know, - Hans-Christian Strebele told, - that knows a lot of things.
And in spite of the fact that the National security agency run by Keith Alexander blocked all his movement, Snowden is ready to arrive to Germany.
However at first it is necessary to define all conditions of its arrival accurately.
Meanwhile, the American legislators start taking measures in response to scandal over espionage programs of the USA.
The Senate Committee on Intelligence approved the bill introducing additional restrictions on activity of the American department of electronic investigation yesterday.
FAU: "Air passengers can use gadgets now by planes (but not to call from the mobile phone)"
Air passengers will be able to use the electronic devices during all flight to read, work, play games, to watch movies and to listen to music, but not to speak by mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect that changes will happen immediately.
As quickly such change is realized, will vary depending on airline, the FAU administrator Michael Uerta at a press conference told.
Airlines should show FAU as their planes answer the new guidelines and that they update the manuals for members of flight crew and the rule on laying of devices to correspond to the new guidelines.
FAU declared that it already received plans from some airlines for expansion of use of portable electronic devices in planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among airlines which already submitted plans.
"Depending on a condition of the plan we could approve expansion of use of electronic devices soon" — declared FAU.
Now passengers are obliged to switch-off the smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the door of the plane is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches height of 10 000 foots and the captain will not give a green light.
Passengers have to switch off the devices again when the plane decreases for landing, and not to include them until the plane appears on the earth.
According to the new guidelines, airlines, whose planes are properly protected from electronic hindrances, can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxing, declared FAU.
The majority of the new airliners and other planes modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at big heights, as expected, answer these criteria.
Laura Glejding, the president of Association of professional stewards, welcomed these changes.
"After the new policy will be safely realized (and we are going to work in close contact with a carrier to achieve it), it will be a sure bet" — declared Gleyding.
We frankly were tired to feel like "persons on duty on school" when business reaches this question.
But connection to the Internet for surfing, an exchange of e-mails, text messages or loading of data will be all the same forbidden at the height less than 10 000 foots, reported agency.
It will be offered to passengers to switch the smartphones, tablets and other devices in the plane mode.
Thus, still any "Words with friends" — intellectual Internet game which the actor Alec Baldwin played on the smartphone in 2011 when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of American Airlines airline for refusal to switch off the device when the plane was at a gate.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, it will be still necessary to stack in a luggage compartment as they can injure somebody if fly on all salon.
Calls from the mobile phone in flight will also be still forbidden.
Regulatory powers on phone calls belong to the Federal commission on communication, but not FAU.
FAU can withdraw a ban on some electronic devices during take off and landing
Last month Mark Rozenker from National council on safety of transport, the national expert in safety of transportations of CBS News, declared that cell phones are still considered as risk.
"Cell phones — it validly a problem not only because potentially they can create hindrances for navigation devices, but we know thanks to FKS that they can create hindrances for towers of cellular communication when the plane is airborne" — Rozenker told.
The branch advisory committee created by FAU for studying of this question recommended last month that the government allowed wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years pressure upon FAU for the purpose of weakening of restrictions on their use increased.
Critics, such as democrat senator from the State of Missouri Claire Makkaskil, claim that for a ban there are no the good reasons connected with safety.
Observance of restrictions also becomes more and more difficult to be provided as use of devices became universal.
Some researches show that to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to switch off the devices.
FAU started limiting use by passengers of electronic devices in 1966 in response to messages on hindrances for the navigation and communication equipment when passengers started carrying with themselves FM radio receivers — hi-tech gadgets of that time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electric systems, than the previous generations of planes, but they are also developed and approved by FAU, as steady against electronic hindrances.
Airlines offer passengers use of Wi-fi at cruiser height within several years.
The planes modified for Wi - Fi - systems, are also steadier against hindrances.
The vast majority of liners is adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, told Uerta.
Today's electronic devices usually radiate radio signals of much lower power, than the previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading electronic books, for example, radiate only the minimum signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who achieved mitigation of restrictions on use by passengers of electronic devices, there was an Amazon.com company.
In 2011 representatives of the company loaded the whole airliner the devices for reading electronic books Kindle and flew on it to check existence of problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAU advisory committee expressed the mixed feelings concerning, whether any risk represents use of devices.
Douglas Kidd from National association of air passengers declared that considers hindrances from devices real even if the risk is minimum.
Other members of the committee said that there are only separate messages of pilots confirming that devices can create hindrances for aviation systems, and the majority of these messages the very old.
Nevertheless the committee recommended that FAU allowed pilots to demand from passengers to switch-off devices during instrument landings in the conditions of limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sane step towards to passengers who now use a set of technological devices.
"We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection" — Roger Dow, the CEO of Tourist association of the USA told.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of attempt to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the countries of East partnership - such statement to BNS agency made in department of state security of the republic (DGB).
Information on it is published on DELFI portal.
According to the message, in particular Moscow is going "to stipulate" the president of Lithuania Dalia Grybauskaite and to publish the forged documents allegedly found in Russian State archive which concern the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to intelligence service, preparation of information attack is conducted by department of the analysis of public management processes of the Russian President Administration on interregional and cultural ties with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov who more than once was visiting Lithuania and who was taking part in congress of the Lithuanian people's party.
Also the participant of operation allegedly is the employee of department V. Smirnov.
As the intelligence service claims, Smirnov under cover scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted to local politicians, political scientists and members of the media.
Now entrance on the territory of the country is forbidden Smirnov.
The day before the president of Lithuania Grybauskaite declared that knows about the information attack preparing on it.
In her opinion, the main of the reasons successful presidency of Lithuania in Council of the European Union and "aspiration of the country to power independence" is
The Lithuanian leader not once criticized earlier actions of the Russian authorities.
So she declared that in the Kremlin Lithuania treat "insufficiently validly".
Besides, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of promotion to Lithuania of "only one requirements".
Let's remind, in September Rospotrebnadzor suspended import Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that quality of production does not meet sanitary and epidemiologic standards.
Then the leader of Lithuania declared that if Russia will not withdraw a ban, the government of the country has to prepare the appeal to the WTO.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine can deprive process of smoking of pleasure
Scientists developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine which could deprive process of smoking of cigarettes of pleasure.
One dose of a vaccine could protect mice from nicotinic dependence for the rest of life.
Further tests prior to tests in public are necessary, on what some years, but professor Ronald Kristall from medical college will be required Whale Cornell in New York declared that the first results encourage.
"We very much hope that such strategy of application of a vaccine can help, at last, to millions of smokers who tried to throw, having tried all methods which are available in the market today, but found out that their nicotinic dependence rather strong to overcome it by means of these modern means" — professor Cornell told.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus which was developed to bear genetic information for production of anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects cells of a liver which then start making a stable stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any molecules of nicotine in blood, neutralizing them before they reach a brain, preventing receiving nicotinic blow by the smoker.
In tests the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine subsequently, continued the normal activity.
And mice who were not given a vaccine, "relaxed", and it is a sign of that nicotine reached their brain, - researchers speak.
These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tobacco vaccines suffered failure because they contained antibodies.
To keep the high level of antibodies, injections needed to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine probably will be much lower because it turns cells of a liver into factories of antibodies.
Professor Kristall told that if future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotinic dependence.
But it is more probable that she will be used by smokers to give up smoking.
"They will know that if they will start smoking again, they will not receive from this pleasure because of a nicotinic vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit" — he told.
The British scientists told that results were interesting, but warned that additional researches are necessary.
Prewinter efforts.
That it is necessary to make in a garden prior to the beginning of frosts
It is better to choose cupriferous preparations, for example 1% bordeaux mix or the preparations Abiga-Pik from fungicides, Oksikh, Ordan, etc. in the fall.
Frontier Airlines will raise a payment for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to raise from passengers to $100 that they carry by hand luggage aboard the flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start raising to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or aerated water though their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers will be able to leave themselves all can.
The new payment for hand luggage extends on bags in the top luggage compartments therefore the small bags placed under a seat will remain free.
Frontier told that will raise $25 if collecting is paid in advance, and $100 if the traveling pay, having only appeared at a gate.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Malley told that the payment in $100 has to force passengers to think of payment in advance.
"We do not want to raise a payment for it" — she told.
Airlines started raising a payment for the first and second bag which is handed over in baggage, in 2008.
The passengers trying to avoid this collecting fill so much, how many will be able, in the hand luggage placed in the top luggage compartments because of what in these compartments often there is no place.
Collecting — one of ways to force passengers to carry by less aboard.
O'Malley told that this new collecting actually not for the sake of earning money.
The matter is that the most loyal clients of Frontier declare that it becomes more difficult to find a place in the top luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the site of airline, will not have to pay.
It means that one passenger in turn at an exit to the flight Frontier can have an opportunity to carry by a bag free of charge while the following passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley told that change of procedures on the website and at front desks of Frontier is urged to guarantee that passengers will know about collecting before they get to a gate.
New charge Frontier for hand luggage will not start being raised till summer though date is not determined yet.
Passengers often complain of a payment for baggage and other collecting, but airlines adore them.
They claim that processing of baggage costs money, and passengers who need this service, have to pay for it.
Many on the Wall Street consider addition of luggage collecting is familiar that airlines raise enough money to cover costs of air flights after several years of losses.
However the majority of them did not concern charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. entered the first charge for hand luggage three years ago, and one more discounter of Allegiant Air followed its example later.
The only other airline with such collecting is the Hungarian Wizz Air, the consultant for airlines Jay Sorensen who attentively traces additional collecting told.
By its assessment in the report of December, 2011, charge for hand luggage brings Spirit of $50 million a year.
Sorensen, the former top manager of Midwest Airlines, flied the flight Spirit recently, and it was interesting to it that he will find in a gate when passengers face unusual charge Spirit for hand luggage.
"Process of landing was the most smooth that I saw for the career in airlines" — he told.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and emergence of a fight at a gate.
The plane was full, he told, "and landing took place promptly".
Frontier also follows Spirit concerning a payment in $2 for coffee, tea, aerated water or juice.
Frontier declared that passengers who receive aerated water or juice, can leave themselves all can and that having added coffee it will be provided free of charge.
She will still distribute free of charge water.
US Airways short time tried to raise a payment for drinks in 2008, but refused it in seven months after passengers started complaining and no other large airline followed its example.
Frontier initiative of collection of a payment for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from airline — is its last measure for customer acquisition on the website.
Airlines pay online sellers of tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
It allowed all airlines incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, but not to address to tourist online agency.
However Frontier went further all in this area.
In September it started giving twice less bonus miles of often flying passenger to clients who bought tickets through on-line travel agency.
On Wednesday it cut off bonus number of miles to 25 percent from trip miles.
So, the trip to 1000 miles with Frontier acquired at on-line travel agency would allow to receive 250 miles.
Besides, passengers can choose a place in advance, only if they buy tickets directly on the site Frontier.
Frontier have a base of loyal clients in its hometown of Denver, but its business is reduced and becomes unprofitable.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent, and flight opportunities were reduced almost by 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the parental company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tries to correct Frontier finance within sale to airline.
Putin achieved impunity for the friend Assad
And now - news because of the ocean, namely - from Syria where, as we know today, Israel struck blow to rockets of the Russian production which, according to messages, intended to "Hezbollah".
Today Syria satisfied an important condition - to destroy the productions of the chemical weapon by November 1.
It was made within the agreement reached with mediation of Russia and which allowed the USA not to perform military operation which they closely approached this summer.
In more detail our chief international correspondent Richard Engel will tell about the weapon and that all this means to the Syrian president.
Washington declared that Assad's regime will be punished for it.
More than 1400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were lost in August from the poisoning gas.
And punishment came.
But not in the form of the American bombings, and in the form of the transaction which Assad's friend - Vladimir Putin arranged.
Syria will refuse the chemical weapon to the middle of the next year.
And today - an important milestone.
The group of the international experts reported that Syria put out of action the declared factories on production of the chemical weapon.
More long-term and hard task is a destruction of tons of the chemical weapon and components to it.
As we understand, it is about one thousand tons.
Earlier Washington said that days of Assad are considered.
I consider, Assad has to leave.
The question not in, whether happens it, and in when it happens.
It is not legitimate any more and has to leave.
But Assad remains.
Also feels even more surely.
Its troops still use artillery, rockets and napalm.
His opponents are separated and badly armed.
Its people forcedly leave the houses, many starve.
Some should feed on leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad avoided punishment for massacre.
The agreement on the chemical weapon is called success of diplomacy, to inspectors awarded Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad made impression of the person ready to cooperation.
Today in Washington the ambassador of the USA in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When the child perishes for hunger, it is hardly easier for his mother than that did not kill him by means of the chemical weapon.
Assad keeps so far.
Also changes the weapon for the power.

Parents of interseksualny children can choose "uncertain sex"
Germany became the first European country which recognized the third floor at the children born with external genitals of intermediate type.
The newborn will surely not attribute man's or a female any more.
The new law does not demand from parents to call any sex of such children, allowing parents to specify a floor as "uncertain" or "unspecified" in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions on operation on assignment of a floor by the newborn, and counteract discrimination of interseksualny people.
One interseksualny person, according to BBC, told many years later: "I am not a man and not the woman".
I will remain the scrappy product created by doctors with bruises and scars.
About one of two thousand children born annually is not neither the boy, nor the girl.
They have an interseksualnost, one of about 60 pathological states which get under the diagnosis of "violation of sexual development" — the collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seed plants) or unusually developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson, perhaps, was interseksualy.
Gender identification is still insufficiently studied, however most of experts in the USA say that if the sex cannot be defined, better to use all available information and to appropriate it, than to wait and trace psychological and physical development of the child before carrying out operation if at all it will occur.
The New York psychiatrist, doctor Jack Dresher who specializes on problems of gender identification, told that the new German law "sounds as good idea".
Interseksualny children create an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have menacing violation lives which demand surgery, however most of children does not have them" — he told.
You can appropriate a floor without operation and then look as the personality develops.
The science how at the child any gender identity will develop, is not too exact.
Nobody can answer questions of why it occurs.
It as a riddle about why people happen gomoseksualna.
The report sent to the European commission in 2011 describes interseksualny people as differing from transsexual or transgender as their state is related not to a gender, and to their biological structure which does not correspond only neither man's, nor to a female, and is typical for both at the same time or is not characteristic for one of them.
These characteristics can be shown in secondary sexual signs, such as the muscle bulk, distribution of indumentum, a breast and a constitution; primary sexual signs, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also adumbrates about discrimination which interseksualny and transgender people in the sphere of employment, and also about the level of oppressions, cruelty and crimes because of prejudices face.
Boys with gender deviations have a special camp now.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put man's, female or "the third floor" in the official documents.
In June the 52-year-old inhabitant of Australia Norri Mai-Uelbi became the first-ever person, recognized "sexless", having asserted in court the right for saving of the "uncertain" sexual status for the rest of life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the German passports the third designation in addition to M and F — X, that is interseksualny will be used.
In the next France gender issues still cause contradictions, according to news release on the France 24 channel.
In 2011 tens legislators from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed the petition about withdrawal of "the gender theory" from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, having written that "in a situation when the world is involved in a new state where the floor is a choice subject, and sexual activity — no, we overturn two more pillars of a civilization".
One mother of the newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that established to children a floor at the birth.
"To raise the child rather hard and without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know a sex of the child" — she told the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically the children born with male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites — by name beautiful Greek god who possessed signs of both floors.
And more than only ten years ago the medical community perceived a gender as a leaf on which it is possible to erase everything, and then again to draw.
But now many challenge the ethical bases for a surgery, knowing that gender identity is difficult, and doctors sometimes make an incorrect choice, without knowing as the child will perceive the floor appropriated to it when grows.
"In the middle of the XX century it was called as "an urgent psychiatric case"" — Dresher told.
When such children were born, you called not the psychiatrist — you called the surgeon.
The dominating theory how to treat children with genitals of intermediate type, was offered by doctor John Manya from Johns Hopkins University who considered that the gender easily gives in to change.
He introduced the term "gender identity" into circulation and claimed that environment signals, including social — how parents raise the child — interact with genes and the child's hormones, defining, whether the person will consider himself as the man or the woman.
But in one case of 1966 known as "John/Joan", its theories appeared questionable.
He advised the boy's parents, whose penis was injured during negligent trimming, completely to castrate the child, having removed also his small eggs, and to raise it as the girl.
"Manya presented a case as a successful example of transition, but it was not so" — Dresher told.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married the woman.
But in 38 years he committed suicide.
Dresher told that now some doctors still "apply this model".
But in the 1990th, with arrival of the Internet, the people who endured these operations on change of a floor declared themselves, "dissatisfied with result".
Such is was also Jim Bruce's case, the 36-year-old writer from the State of Montana which was born with man's chromosomes of XY, but genitals of intermediate type.
Doctors could not define precisely, whether there was for it a big clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he will never be able to lead "full-fledged life" of the man.
Therefore soon after its birth in 1976 the external genital and Bruce's small eggs were surgically removed, and it was brought up as the girl.
Began to give it female hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew that I am not a girl" — he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
In 18 years to it the vaginoplastika was appointed.
But being in a depression and understanding that something not so, he demanded medical documentation.
That he learned, was awful.
I was sterilized at the birth, and anybody never told me about it.
Bruce was born with violation of sexual development which did not give it to a body to make enough testosterone for normal development of genitals.
Having learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving pricks of testosterone and having removed the breast.
Operation made it fruitless.
Today he speaks out in defense of others in the organization under the name Interface Project, trying to bring into norm perception of people with an interseksualnost.
But Ann Temar-Mettis, the executive director of the Californian legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned by that the German law "induces to a naveshivaniye of labels and a stigma".
"Many activists are concerned by that the German law will induce parents to make the hasty decision and to give to the child "uncertain sex"" — she told.
We are afraid that it will promote intervention.
We consider that it is better to appropriate man's or a female, and then to wait.
But we did not see yet how this law, therefore everything will prove that we can do — it to speculate.
Temar-Mettis told that her organization supports the Australian law as "it allows adults to make a choice for the third floor".
"Adults have to have opportunity to make own decisions on a formal sex" — she speaks.
The German law means its assignment at the birth.
This battle which small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions of rather own body.
But Dr. Arleene Barats, the mammologist-radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with violation of sexual development and which helps hundreds of other people with support group, told that the German law "will support" both parents, and children.
The daughter Barats, Cathie, was born with man's chromosomes, however it has a violation of sexual development under the name "syndrome of full tolerance to androgens".
As its androgenic receptors incorrectly work, at Cathie female signs developed.
It has a vagina, but there is no uterus and ovaries.
Now, in 29 years, Cathie is married and studies internship in children's psychiatry at university of Pennsylvania.
In spite of the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become the parent by means of adoption or gestational substitute motherhood.
"The law gives to parents time not to make hasty decisions" — Barats told.
He allows them time to make some analyses and to understand a situation, and also a period before they write "man's" or "female".
In that case you as it should be — raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel pleasure.
We do not need to do operation which is irreversible hasty.
"It allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates excitement which moves parents because they do not feel that arrive correctly" — she told.
Eventually the child will solve, with what floor to him or her is more comfortable — and it is remarkable.
It gives to children the chance to make the decision independently.
U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence services sometimes "went too far" at data collection
The United States Secretary of State John Kerry recognized that at data collection and wiretaps the American intelligence services sometimes "went too far", nevertheless the politician noted that information on the wiretap of 70 million people which appeared in mass media is not true.
I assure you that innocent people during this process did not suffer, but attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in certain cases it went too far and had illegal character.
I recognize it as also the president recognizes... and we will watch that it did not happen in the future", - quotes the Secretary of State of AFP.
The experts of horse-racing actions gathering in Cardiff to battle for the prize "Horse of Year", knew that the competition will be very high.
But nobody was ready to three-year-old Fenton Kirkland's appearance.
Still even not the school student, only for some months before, this kid who took the first steps with the pet a Shetland pony of Toffee at a trot flew through three rounds that with ease to take the first prize, having left 30 adult rivals far behind.
This unseparable couple — identical growth — was highly appreciated for appearance, behavior and style at annual competition which is held by the center of equestrian sport Sannibenk in the city of Radri near Cardiff.
Having come to a public inspection against men and women in graceful hats kettles, he shifted aslant the cap and is proud spent around two-year-old Toffee.
Judges praised Fenton for him absolutely beyond the years the developed knacks of the treatment of horses.
And Toffee received the highest mark for appearance and character.
To Fenton presented to Toffee on his third birthday in March of last year, and since then he was engaged with a Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother Donna told: "Fenton and Toffi make a fine duet".
They had many rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and a rozochka.
It was only its second performance with Toffee, and all of us were delighted when he won.
Absolutely strangers on the arena considered it so phenomenal that wanted to be photographed with it.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo that near Ebb-Vail in the Southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of the aunt Sharon Howells who exposes horses within more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells told: "All public was struck, and all cried out approving exclamations and clapped".
He ran on sand on all length of the arena and though looked such tiny, perfectly made the business.
Fenton crazy about animals — it loves horses, tractors and farms, and it has two chickens of whom he cares.
How it began, shortly he will already take part in "A horse of year" — and I am sure that he will act well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition told: "To Fenton only three years, but he knows how to treat the pony".
Together they excellent team.
Judges marked out Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and how they presented themselves on a show ring.
They estimate coordination of performance of a pony and the factory owner — Fenton and Toffi were the best on a ring.
I am sure that Fenton was helped by his attractive dress, it really well looked in the role.

The court suspended execution of the decision on practice "to stop-and-search" in the New York department of police
On Thursday the appellate court of the federal district suspended performance of the judicial resolution demanding changes in the stop-and-search program of the New York department of police and discharged the judge of business.
The appellate court of the second district of the USA declared that execution of decisions of the judge Shira Sheyndlin will be suspended before receiving results of the appeal submitted by the city.
In August the judge decided that the city violated the constitution how it carried out the program for street detentions and interrogations.
The city made the appeal complaint to its decision and resolutions on the correcting measures, including the instruction to appoint the controler to help office of police to change practice of work and the related program of training.
On Thursday the appellate court heard debate of the parties on the petition for a business suspension.
The appellate court declared need of removal of the judge because it violated the code of behavior of judges of the USA and was not counted with need to avoid bias demonstration, partially because of an interview series in mass media and the official statements containing the public answer to criticism of court.
The judge decided that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unreasonably addressing to black and Latin Americans according to the stop-and-search program.
She appointed the external controler for supervision of large-scale changes which include reforms in area the politician, of training and control, and also decided to start the pilot program for testing of the video cameras fixed on a body in those police stations where there is a majority of detentions.
In August New York came to the decision to stop practice of storage of names and addresses of people, put on which were stopped after police check.
Debate on the appeal of the city has to take place after March 14, 2014.
Tactics "to stop and search" was criticized by a great number of lawyers by the civil rights.
"Stop search" practices some decades in this or that form, however the quantity of documentary stops sharply increased at administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, having reached in 2011 an absolute record in 684 330 people, the majority from which black and Latin Americans.
In 2004 four persons, all — representatives of ethnic minorities, filed a lawsuit the collective claim.
Supporters of changes in the stop-and-search program in the New York department of police say that these changes will put an end to unfair practice, will create more reliable and effective police service and can affect how other departments of police realize this practice.
Opponents claim that changes will reduce fighting spirit of police officers, but not crime rate, will lead to unnecessary expenditure of money and will not solve more global problem of difficult conditions in police because of reduction of number of officers by some thousands for the last decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop practice "to stop-and-search" which corresponds to the constitution, however changes a way with what the New York police stops people.
Azarov promised to Ukrainians a collapse in prices on goods after signing of association with the European Union
The prime minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that the prices in the country will considerably fall after the country signs the agreement on association with the European Union.
He declared it during communication with readers of the page on "Facebook".
I can tell definitely that the prices are defined by a large number of factors among which is, including, and customs payments.
And so, after signing of the agreement and coming into effect of provision on the Free trade zone, the level of the customs duties on import of goods from the EU considerably will decrease.
And it will mean, as the prices have to fall.
"It as for goods which arrive from EU countries", - was written by Azarov.
As for other goods, influence of the agreement on the prices will not be to such straight lines, it will be mediated.
But, nevertheless, there too there should not be a price increase.
Therefore messages on billboards which appeared in our country quite a lot recently that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, it not absolutely so or if more precisely to speak - at all not so", - Azarov summarized.
Package of saving measures of $325 million for health care of Tasmania
The federal government insists that the package of saving measures of $325 million for the weakened health system of Tasmania will be added with severe conditions which guarantee that the government of staff will not spend means for nothing.
The federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek declared that the Commonwealth takes "urgent measures" to prevent the crisis caused by aging of the population of this island state, higher level of chronic diseases and restrictions of system.
The decision on financing within four years was made after consultations of the government with the independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
"The government offered a package of the emergency saving measures which, we trust, will solve specific problems, facing staff" — Mrs. Plibersek declared today.
The package of $325 million in size includes $31 million for blitz campaign for planned operations.
2600 more operations, including orthopedic and operations on removal of a cataract, will help to overcome lag.
There is also money for the clinics accepting patients without making an appointment in Hobart and Launceston, for improvement of quality of leaving after a hospital, training of medical experts, security services of mental health and introduction of systems of personal electronic medical records in local hospitals.
"These investments will go on the ideas stated by the advanced doctors realization how it is better to help health system of Tasmania" — Mrs. Plibersek told.
The minister insisted that the government of Tasmania will work in the mode of the strict reporting and responsibility.
Staff will need to support the current levels of financing to receive funds of the Commonwealth, and monthly to report on where it spends these additional resources.
The commission from three people will be created to be convinced that staff provides services as it is possible more effectively and is more effective.
Mr. Wilkie declared today that $325 million will solve nothing, "if they are not followed by original reform which will put health system of Tasmania on steadier basis".
Nevertheless he praised the government for the answer to its request for the urgent help with which he for the first time addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the package of the federal help will promote considerably to a conclusion of health system of this staff from critical condition" — Mr. Wilkie told.
According to the government of staff, these additional selective procedures substantially compensate recent reductions.
But the federal oppositional representative on health care Peter Datton considers that today's statement represents "the decision similar to an adhesive plaster".
"The reason for which we here, consists that the labor government of staff pulled out $430 million from health system" — he told ABC TV TV companies.
When the government of staff tears off nearly half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth puts 300 million, it is impossible to pretend to be that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that any dollar from a saving package will not be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Shout of despair of the voter Obama
I voted for the president Obama twice, sharing hope for possibility of changes
He says that Obama allowed obstructionism of republicans to nullify laudable efforts.
The obstructionism cannot excuse problems with the website of the health system reformed by Obama, attacks of UAVs
Memoirs about Obama's campaign are of 2008 a sad reminder that could be
Nathanael P. Morris — the second-year student of medical faculty of Harvard university.
I read awfully sad book these days.
I thought that this book will inspire me at the time of despondency on the second year of medical faculty and will revive in me feeling of hope.
It is called "Impudence for a victory", and these are memoirs about presidential campaign of Barack Obama of 2008.
When I stop writing reports on my patients in the evening and I go to bed, this book returns me when the policy inspired millions of people, and performances could capture spirit.
The victory on elections was impressive, and hosts of news programs did a pause for judgment of this historical moment.
My schoolmates cried with happiness, and my parents protected all newspapers which they could only find.
The young team of strategists had to come to the White house, and the people were ready to changes.
In an effective date of Obama in a position in 2008 its level of support made 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present represents rough awakening as wrest from dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem far reminiscence, a sad reminder on the missed opportunities.
In the years which passed since I lowered the first ballot, changes really happened.
It was that I could not even imagine.
I pay to Obama tribute for its big and various achievements, from adoption of law on available medical care to a conclusion of our military from Iraq, cancellation of the rule "Do Not Ask, Do Not Speak", Osama bin Laden's murder.
Moreover, I consider that the party obstructionism blocked too many attempts of advance of our country forward: immigration reform, possibility of a choice of the state health care and closing of base in Guantanamo among the other.
But after uncountable number of times when I appeared on the party of administration of Obama, protecting it before colleagues and contemporaries, I finished explanations which I can provide.
I reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of republicans cannot explain permission to the wiretap of foreign leaders or drawing blows with UAVs on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain data collection about private life of Americans by National security agency or prosecutions of the unmaskers opening illegal actions of the government.
He cannot explain murder of the American citizen Anwar al-Avlaki extrajudicially or non-compliance with limits of public financing and expenses during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify conclusions of the report in which it is said that the efforts used by the White house to make silent mass media, are "the most aggressive … since Nixon's administration".
And recently it cannot justify that it is not possible to develop the simple website within more than three years after signing of the law on available medical care.
I do not know, whether it to me should be expected.
Whether I had to understand at the age of 18 years, what the management can contradict political campaigns which precede it?
It is obvious that work on an elective office is not the predictable action program as our public dialogue will be formed by opposition political party and such casual events as slaughter in Nyyutaun.
Nevertheless by all examples which are listed above by me it is visible that they substantially were own choice of administration.
And it that disturbs me most of all.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm concerning its candidate.
Mitt Romney represented unclear and rough alternative, appear, that he is not able to make the decision on own policy or views.
I believed that in the second time Obama, having exempted from pressure of future elections, will equal hopes about which we heard during such long time.
However, when this week Obama's rating fell lower than 45%, it became much more difficult to come back in 2008 by means of this book.
It forces me to grieve for many promises which disappeared.
This week I read that part of the book in which it is described how Clinton inflicted over Obama deafening defeat on primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting according to the analysis of the reasons of failure it told the employees that they have to return back to normal and remain faithful to the purpose.
"I want that we returned our appeal — he told.
— We have to remember the one who we are".
Passed five years, Mr. president, and I absolutely agree with you.
The opinions expressed in this comment belong only to Nathanael Morris.
In Egypt the first freely elected president takes the oath
Mohamed Morsi takes the oath, but day of its celebration will hardly mark the end of political struggle in Egypt.
The ISLAMIST Mohamed Morsi promised "new Egypt" when took the oath, having become the first freely elected president of the country, having replaced Hosni Mubarak who was overthrown 16 months ago.
On the inauguration before the Supreme constitutional court of Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after overthrow of a monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black cloaks in the courthouse on the bank of Nile built in style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to the better future, new Egypt and the second republic" — Morsi during the ceremony which is sent live on the state television told.
"Today the Egyptian people laid the foundation of new life — absolute freedom, a genuine democracy and stability" — Morsi, the 60-year-old engineer with an American education from "Muslim Brotherhood", fundamentalist group which the most part from 84 years of the existence was the forbidden organization serving as a target for rigid actions of the governments replacing each other declared.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police officers when Morsi arrived with a small train soon after the 11th morning local time.
Only a few hundreds of supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new president, and, unlike a presidential pomp of times of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only for a short time to pass its motorcade on usually brisk road connecting the downtown to the southern suburbs.
Though Morsi derided as not charismatic "a spare wheel" of "Brothers", its personal prestige sharply grew from the moment of its victory and Friday performance in which he tried to present itself(himself) as the candidate not only Islamists, but also all those who wants to finish business of revolt of 2011 against authoritative Mubarak.
"Today Egypt is the civil, national, constitutional and modern state" — Morsi dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in the hall sheathed by wooden panels where he took the oath told.
After Morsi went to Cairo university where he had to deliver the inaugural speech.
The formal reception with the army orchestra which executed a national anthem during which he stood at attention "quietly" was accorded to it.
There was a military figure field marshal Hussein Tantawi.
Its arrival was met by the slogan "Army and the People — One Hand" which was chanted by hundreds of audience in the main lecture hall of university.
The founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo university in the 1970th years became a stronghold of Islamic student's groups.
Morsi took the symbolical oath on Friday on Tahrir Square where the revolt which finished authoritative board of Mubarak last year arose and promised to return powers of the president of which his position was deprived by the Council of War which accepted affairs from the overthrown leader.
But having agreed to take the official oath before court, but not before parliament as it is accepted, it carries out will of military, and it is a sign of that race for power will proceed.
Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses of English literature will demand that pupils studied at least one play of Shakespeare, the novel of the XIX century, romantic poetry and modern British fiction since 1914.
At examination "extra program texts" will be also submitted to encourage more extensive reading.
The integrated course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
Since 2015 pupils will be obliged to pass separate final examination in language, with persistent recommendations of a choice of English literature as separate examination.
The Department of Education has to issue new training programs on English and mathematics tomorrow — to the first subjects subjected to radical revision.
He will make changes to other main subjects next year.
Separately the regulator in the sphere of examinations of OFQUAL will present the reconsidered structure of final examinations of high school, with new system of estimates and smaller volume of term papers.
Acting in the summer, the Minister of Education Michael Gouv told that "the broad consensus that we have to reform our system of examinations was reached to return public trust", insisting that school final examinations will be "more difficult, more ambitious and more strict".
Researches show that English schools find less time for mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours per week during a quarter), than in the majority of the countries.
For comparison — the Australian schools give on average 143 hours a year, and in Singapore pupils are engaged about 138 hours.
Though formal requirement will not find more time in the schedule for mathematics, sources in the coalition were told that large-scale school final examinations in mathematics in combination with the increased coefficient in the table of ratings, will serve most likely as incentive for providing additional training by schools in this subject.
In the curriculum more attention will be paid to "tasks from real life", including financial mathematics.
Soccer - discord reason?
In the State Duma within "An open tribune" of policy and experts said how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among offers also such sounded: to forbid soccer in the North Caucasus, because from this game - one scandals and discord.
The speaker Sergey Naryshkin reminded about recent events in Biryulev and told that for decrease in "intensity degree in society" politicians and mass media have to be correct in statements.
Probably, he meant recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky who in one of telecasts threatened to surround the Caucasus with a barbed wire if there do not want to limit birth rate...
All acting said and about measures for regulation of migration from the CIS countries, and about measures for harmonization of the relations between the people occupying Russia that gave to discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoryev declared that events in Biryulev - "the model conflict which could be predicted", but "at us is responsible for these questions too many people and instances", and too many cooks spoil the broth.
The concept of multiculturalism which long time concerning migrants was practiced by Europe, according to the public man, failed, and it is necessary to look for the way.
The historian Yury Petrov laid hopes on the new uniform textbook of history.
"Still it is necessary to create a grant on cultural history of the people of the country that school students in Tatarstan knew that for people live in Dagestan and vice versa", - he reported.
Gennady Zyuganov suggested to impose criminal liability for "appeals to a partition of Russia": "If in the USA to tell by radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and will give 20 years of prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky very much tried "not to kindle".
As usual, he accused journalists who submit painful and acute national problems for public discussion of everything: "In the heat of polemic you never know it is possible to tell!"
The leader of United Russia fraction Vladimir Vasilyev right there advised journalists to conclude "charter" and to agree to carry on talk on this subject accurately, and then the same obligations can assume also politicians.
We adopted about 30 laws which regulate migration, and the order in general is established, Mr. Vasilyev declared.
It gave the law which confers on regional and municipal authorities responsibility for the international world in their territory as an example.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share delight concerning this law: in it there are no "clear ideas that such adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
Means, subjects will treat differently the volume of these powers.
Besides municipalities have no shots necessary for the solution of so difficult questions, there are no means, and the center does not give methodical recommendations which they could use, to them...
The head of the State Duma Committee on Nationalities Gadzhimet Safaraliyev suggested to create special department with the terrible name "Ministry of National Security" which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov who in the 90th years headed the similar department abolished subsequently acted against.
It is enough to have at the federal level of the special person, "the minister without portfolio" to which it would be possible to address if that.
"We are on the razor-edge, shells are torn by a row, very important to representatives of different ethnoses and religions together to oppose provocations, and this work has to get worthy information support", - the representative of ROC on communications with society Vsevolod Chaplin told.
Any neutrality of the state concerning dangerous ideologies, religious including to be, in his opinion, should not.
Here Oleg Nilov took away discussion to the unexpected course: "More talented people, than in Chechnya or Dagestan, still it is necessary to look, but they are pushed not that way, not on that road", - he told.
"Not that road" is a development of soccer: "That the football player is beaten all crowd, flags burn down, companions throw stones of each other...

Recognitions of National security agency strengthen paranoia of corporations concerning the state shadowing
In the warm afternoon at the end of August the helicopter of the German police flew by low over consulate of the USA in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instruction of Federal service of protection of the constitution (BfV), service of internal intelligence of Germany, its task was to photograph a roof of the building of representation of the USA which is less than in 5 km from the European central bank and Bundesbank.
The German mass media say that BfV hoped to find antennas of taps, and these actions caused negotiations between the USA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany in Berlin.
James Klepper, the director of the National intelligence of the USA, in September again assured that the USA do not use possibility of foreign intelligence "for plunder of trade secrets of the foreign companies in interests of the American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their profit".
But since Edward Snowden — the contract employee who became the unmasker — started publishing the treasury of secrets of intelligence of the USA, the European governments and heads of the companies are not assured any more, whether it is possible to take the director the word.
Messages on that the National agency of safety of the USA watched the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and got access to the data stored at suppliers of cloudy services of the USA including Google and Yahoo, lifted the paranoia of corporations caused by shadowing of the state on new heights.
News that phone of the chancellor Angela Merkel was listened, perhaps, about ten years became a last straw.
If the most influential person of Europe can become a target, of course, potential targets are also leaders of business.
Snowden made obvious intensive cooperation between intelligence services of the USA and the companies.
I think, it is quite probable that these data are used with mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up" — Oliver Gryun, the president of the association BITMi which represents the small and average IT companies of Germany speaks.
The German companies are convinced that the USA now represent almost same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and plunder of data, according to the research published in July by consulting agency EY.
In all documents opened by Mr. Snowden, nevertheless, still there were no certificates of that the USA transferred trade secrets of the foreign companies to the own companies.
Politicians expressed concern about that the EU is not enough certain opportunities in the field of information technologies and the Internet, and expressed opinion that he should try to reduce the dependence on the USA.
Businessmen are skeptical about it.
Someone in parliament of Germany says that we have to create the German Google.
I can only close eyes and slowly open them again …
"It not option" — Gasso Plattner, the president of the German company supplier of the software for business of SAP speaks.
If there is a need for the powerful European IT industry, you should not allow it have to been lost more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything, except the IT industry.
And nevertheless the coverage and technical development of agencies on espionage of the USA which became known thanks to Snowden's revelations were shock for some companies which thought earlier that the biggest risk of shadowing represents China.
Big shift happens in cloudy technologies where heads of the European companies realized better that the data which are stored in the USA are in the same jurisdiction and therefore are potentially vulnerable.
According to the research conducted by trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non American participants refused plans to use services of the cloudy provider who is in the USA after exposure of the American program for the intellectual analysis of data of Prism.
Jim Sneyb, one of executive directors of SAP, told: "We see that consumers ask a new question which did not arise a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and whether you can guarantee that they physically will remain in this jurisdiction".
Many German heads claim that the last messages — it only confirmation of that they already knew: the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and, therefore, these data have to be protected at any cost.
That there is an economic espionage — no wonder.
It always took place.
"It was a subject of discussion many years and significantly did not change in the current polemic" — Curt Bock, the chief executive officer of the BASF chemical company speaks.
Americans spy for us at commercial and industrial level, and we too spy for them because it enters our national interests — to protect our commercial enterprises.
Leaders of corporations usually do not like to brag of those countermeasures which they undertook as it can provide advantage to the opponent.
In the large companies the thought that to take a free flash card at an exhibition or to leave the laptop without supervision in a hotel room — it, at least, imprudently was acquired for a long time.
Ulrich Hakenberg, the board member of Audi carmaker, says that many years it is standard practice — to assemble mobile phones before board meetings that they could not be used as taps.
The federal service of protection of the constitution of Germany recommends to heads of the companies to consider possibility of use of simple pre-paid mobile phones during foreign trips because of vulnerability of smartphones.
Pre-paid mobile phones jump out subsequently.
Nevertheless there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable for breakings and shadowing.
In Germany many similar companies are leaders in the world market in the concrete niche.
"Small and medium-sized companies often do not have experience, employees and financial resources effectively to protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access" — warns in the report of BfV.
The USA warn the own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The national prospecting report of the USA in February placed France together with Russia and Israel in the second row of violators who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approves The Washington Post.
The board member of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it is about economic espionage, "French are most worse".
Bernard Skarsini, the former head of the French agency of internal investigation of DCRI as it is reported, said in interview this month: "Services are known perfectly that all countries, even when they cooperate in fight against terrorism, spy for the allies".
The international airport of Los Angeles was evacuated because of firing in one of terminals.
The unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 Moscow time).
Protection evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminal.
According to preliminary data, the man conducted firing from a rifle of high power.
Some people, including the employee of management of safety on transport of the USA, were wounded.
The police returned fire and detained the malefactor.
He is easily wounded.
Tripodi denies that is subject to Obeyd's influence
The former minister of work of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the person involved in investigation of anti-corruption supervisory authority of this staff.
The former minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi disproves modification of an order of rent of seaside objects at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeyd who was secretly owning shares in three real estate objects on the state earth.
The independent commission against corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded the ​​ investigation of, whether Mr. Obeyd at several ministers of staff lobbied extension lease contracts on Serkyyular Ki where the family Obeydov possesses two restaurants and cafe, without passing of the tender after the expiration of their action in August, 2005.
She investigates statements now that Mr. Tripodi knew about secret participation of Mr. Obeyd in real estate objects, after the evidences given by the former deputy head of administration of Mr. Tripodi Leann Eshpoul on Thursday.
Within several years of the discussions which began in 2005, the government insisted on that rent was exposed on open competition.
Tenants were against it, and also wanted longer terms of rent.
In 2009 lease contracts of the enterprises on Serkyyular Ki which brought to a family Obeydov about $2,5 million a year, were prolonged without exposure to open competition.
Mr. Tripodi who was the minister of infrastructure and transport from February, 2006 to November, 2009, originally supported open competitions.
But it denied that changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeyd who as Mr. Tripodi recognized, insistently advised to make changes to rent policy of the government.
Talk in August and September, 2007 between Mr. Obeyd, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, the senior official who came to the ministry of ports after work under the leadership of Mr. Obeyd in department of fishery was given in the interpretation of telephone conversations presented to ICAC.
"Whether there was a question discussed during these telephone conversations, a question of development of policy of commercial rent?" — the assistant to the commissioner Anthony Uili of Mr. Tripodi asked.
"no" — Mr. Tripodi answered. —
I cannot remember that was discussed, but it was certain not that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeyd.
The UN declares the new purposes on poverty overcoming
The United Nations has to get immediately to work on a new complex of tasks on replacement of the purposes of development of the millennium which were formulated for poverty overcoming around the world 12 years ago.
The Australian diplomats played a key role in advance of "the purposes on a sustainable development" to replace TsRT which validity period expires in 2015, before the summit of the UN on a sustainable development which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in total version of the document which will be signed by world leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, during the summit.
The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told the night before to participants of the summit that time above national interests now came "to become".
"I am glad that member countries of the UN agreed to start and take under control process of creation of the universal purposes of a sustainable development — TsUR" — he told.
These TsUR will rely on our progress in area of achievement of the objectives of development of the millennium, they will become an integral part of the concept of development for the period after 2015.
I will use the best efforts for use of the powers conferred to me by member countries to embody our vision of the purposes of a sustainable development which rely on successful performance of TsRT.
In municipal payment orders of residents of Voronezh there will be a new line of expenses - assignments on capital repairs of the house.
By the most approximate calculations for the standard two-room apartment since new year it is necessary to pay extra from 100 to 400 rubles a month.
The exact standard will define the government of the region.
But when to paint an entrance, to put in order staircases or even to replace the elevator - will solve residents.
Such law was approved by deputies of region duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh region duma, noted: "In this case too it is necessary to bring an order - to establish sequence of overhaul of houses, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which at us often register that in Moscow, in Orenburg, still somewhere, it will be establishment of the state control over an expenditure of funds which are raised by inhabitants for repair of apartment houses".
Under control of the state now and share construction.
The law protecting from swindlers is approved by regional Duma in final reading.
The document was born not from scratch.
In our region 4,5 thousand people suffered from dishonest builders.
Problems of the majority managed to be solved.
By the way, the new law registers the rights and duties for all participants of share construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh region duma, declared: "It is no secret that in this sphere the abuses connected by that in the 98th year shareholders same got, and in the 2000th years the same shareholders too began."
People started earning on it to cover an opening, including, adopted these two laws.
Near Voronezh it is decided to construct the center of temporary stay for the foreign citizens who are subject to deportation.
The regional parliament adopted such law not only under pressing of federation.
The problems connected with illegal migrants in the region though take away.
So, last year on the migratory account there were slightly more than 100 thousand foreigners.
But only every fifth issued the official work permit.
Where the others work and whether they pay taxes - a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, the chairman of the Voronezh region duma, told: "They violated the law, but are not criminals."
Vessels are not present, and it is necessary to deport - they should be contained somewhere.
The federation made such decision that at the expense of regional means to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region such place is defined is an Old Olshanka of the Semiluksky area.
Well, and finally the regional parliament allocated with new privileges of parents having many children.
First, families where raise 5 and more children completely exempt from a transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3,5 million - but as much also parents having many children save.
Secondly, and this main thing, that who will adopt the 3rd and more kids, since new year subsidies for housing will give out.
On each family member the new law provides 18 square meters, at the price of 30 thousand for meter.
Family, for example, from 6 people - the father, mother, the own child and the 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to standards, the state acquires housing of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left coast or the Southwest residential district - quite acceptable option.
Well, and in the district for this sum it is possible to buy already whole cottage.
The centers for control and prevention of diseases issued the recommendations for schools concerning an allergy at children
On Wednesday the centers for control and prevention of diseases published the list of recommendations about control of food allergies at children at schools.
It is the first list of similar recommendations which was issued by the U.S. Government while the number of the children of school age suffering from food allergy grows.
Now one of 20 children in the USA has a food allergy.
The centers for control and prevention of diseases found out that prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The management contains information for schools how to increase awareness of teachers and the service personnel on food allergy at children and how to give help in a case of emergence of allergic reaction.
It also recommends to schools to hold adrenaline reserves — most often for injections the automatic medical syringe of EpiPen — for assistance is used at potentially deadly anafilaksiya.
Legislature of states made changes to regulations recently to allow schools to do adrenaline reserves with smaller difficulties.
The notice also contains the list of the typical symptoms described by children who had an allergic reaction.
Children can speak: "such feeling as though something tycht in my language", "such feeling that is always on the lips of me hair" or "language pinches".
The Kenyan press is revolted with the provocative law on mass media
"This terrible place, is also the bases for a question: what can not allow destructions of independence of judicial system by Parliament in the future?" — the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
"This law very severe and retaliatory, and we reject it" — Cyrus Kamau, the managing director of Capital Group — the parent company CapitalFM into which one of the independent radio stations which are most respected in Kenya and the news site enters told.
He told that the new judicial authority on mass media "will always be biased as it is continuation of the government", and restrictions of content and advertizing will do much harm to position of Kenya in global economy.
"I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and to return it to deputies" — he told.
According to the The Star newspaper, the new law in fact will allow the government "to take mass media death grip", and The Standard reported that the democracy and a freedom of speech in Kenya "received serious blow", and scarified the bill as "draconian".
Adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken for strengthening of national security after September attack of Muslim terrorists in shopping center Westgate.
Kenyan mass media caused anger of the authorities, broadcasting records of surveillance cameras where troops which were sent to an attack place, allegedly plunder expensive shopping center.
The call of two journalists and the official of mass media on interrogation though the call was cancelled after mass protests of mass media became reaction of the chief of police David Kimayo.
Under the new law of publishing house can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists — to one million with additional risk to be "excluded from lists", that is to receive a ban on receiving official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate property of the violator if the penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, "even it is enough one penalty to paralyze work of the majority of FM radio stations".
She also reported that these measures can render destructive effect on so-called "a brisk blog sphere" of Kenya.
Politicians understand that, having made mass media silent, they will be able to do everything that to them will take in head, with impunity.
"Anybody never learns" — the journalist of Nation Mutuma Mathew wrote, characterizing Kenyan mass media as a key source of the constraining and counterbalancing forces in public life.
"The politicians provided to themselves will ruin the country and will return us to hunting and collecting" — he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were a target of public anger and in the past.
In May they voted for cancellation of the reductions appointed by the national commission on salaries and restoration of the size of the huge salary, component about 532 thousand shillings a month which are not assessed by taxes — one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information on ill treatment of the child in Biysk

Now investigators all circumstances are investigated, and also the legal assessment is given to actions of staff of kindergarten.
After charge of Evgeny Vasilyev's bad taste started talking
Evgenia Vasilyeva on which person nearly a year the close attention of mass media is riveted, still never commented on numerous publications in the press both about plunders in the Ministry of Defence, and about it personally - the relations with the ex-Minister of Defence Anatoly Serdyukov, its poetry and about addiction to valuable things.
However on November 1 the person involved in business of "Oboronservis" broke silence.
Said in interview of Life News of Vasilyev: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out from me any negative information concerning the former Minister of Defence".
There was a blackmail regarding that I have to give evidences, differently I will be put in prison.
Today these threats stopped.
Further we go to court, we will prove the innocence.
We are sure of a victory for 100 percent.
Thus from interview it is possible to draw a conclusion that, perhaps, most of all Vasilyeva was touched by words that at her is unimportant with taste.
Possibly, the statement of the official representative of the RF IC Vladimir Markin that in a collection of pictures which was collected by the person involved in business of "Oboronservis", fakes were found means.
Among the arrested property there is a number of pictures which the hostess, being confident in the deep knowledge of art, got as masterpieces of world painting.
However the art criticism examination appointed by investigators after arrest of these pictures established that they have no art value and, simply speaking, are cheap fakes", - Markin at the beginning of October noted.
Some pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then after all recognized that they from the Ministry of Defence are not stolen, thus told that at me it is bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it simply a lawlessness", - is told by Vasilyeva.
Thus on a question, whether she admits the guilt though in one of 12 criminal episodes imputed to it, Vasilyev declared: "Naturally, no.
There is nothing to recognize in general.
Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation about which there is a speech.
Simply mislead the people, that's all.
Besides, in response to today's statement of the RF IC that Vasilyeva evades from studying of materials of criminal case, the lawyer of the person involved declared that to it and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with case papers".
What served as the reason to revelations by Vasilyeva who is under house arrest who was still not communicating with the press?
It is possible how the woman she could not but answer charge of bad taste?
Or the journalists of Komsomolskaya Pravda claiming couple of days ago are right, what it "fell into even bigger trance under house arrest" because of news of Anatoly Serdyukov's reconciliation with the wife and his return to a family bosom?
The famous military observer of "KP" Victor Baranets in the article "Serdyukov returned to the wife?" wrote: "Investigators do not exclude that after such shock it can become more talkative on interrogations".
Before Vasilyev assumed some charges of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defence.
The defender of "Juventus" Leonardo Bonuchchi will not help team with the closest match of the championship of Italy with "Parma".
As reports Football Italia, the trainer's staff made the decision not to include it in the demand for game to keep before a match of the 4th round of a group round of the Champions League with "Real".
Also Lichtsteiner, Vuchinich and Pepe will not take part in a duel with "Parma".
And the forward Fabio Quallarella was restored after a trauma and is ready to play.
The government of Great Britain declared the research directed on increase of economic effect for Scotland of the project of a railway line of HS2.
The HS2 project assumes opening of the high-speed message with Scotland and the North of England, from the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
The Minister of Transport baroness Kramer noted that the project "will unite Great Britain".
The Minister of Transport of Scotland Keith Brown told that it works on the plan, "delighted" with prospect, with the government of Great Britain.
The first Stage will consist in construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is complete, lines will be laid to Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government reconsidered estimated cost of construction of the high-speed line between London and the North of England from £32,7 to £42,6 billion.
The government of Great Britain which conducts negotiations with Transport Scotland, charged to HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements of capacity of the railroad and reduction of duration of trips for Northern England and Scotland.
It has to include opportunity to overcome a way from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer told: "Our purpose on HS2 - to create rather national network which will make Great Britain and its cities is closer to each other".
We develop HS2 because benefits which it will bring, are huge.
Without it we will face crisis of capacity in our railway system.
But the speech also goes about transport communication of the cities with each other; across all Great Britain 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement — good news to Scotland".
On behalf of the Scottish government Keith Brown urged Mr. Carmichael to support inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network "unambiguously".
Mr. Brown told: "The high-speed railroad has every chance to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railroad across all Great Britain".
Therefore we are glad to work in partnership with the government of Great Britain to consider options of construction of the high-speed railroad in Scotland, creations of benefit for all and continuations of the railway line Glasgow — Edinburgh which already plans the Scottish government.
I look forward to consideration of results of research with the British ministers next year and joint making decision on the following steps.
The USA cut down a food grant for the poor
The grant to food for a family from four people decreases by 36 dollars a month
Since Friday in the USA financial security of the grocery coupons known as "fudstempa" as action of the appropriate state program comes to an end is reduced.
On a food grant to a family from four people it will be allocated for 36 dollars a month less now, than earlier, officials speak.
It will affect 47 million the poorest Americans.
According to agency Reuters, in 2012 financial year the grant to one person averaged 133 dollars a month.
Expenses on food aid in the USA grew to 80 billion dollars a year because of growth of unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on the free food aid which is given out on the "fudstempa" carrying such name since former times when they had a form of paper coupons.
When the present economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate growth of economy and to help the poorest Americans.
However republicans in the Congress demand to carry out further reductions of the funds allocated for the program, declaring that it has to be aimed at the help to those who needs it more than others.
Owners of food shops across all America worry that reductions will lead to decrease in expenses of consumers.
Congressmen of the USA continue to argue how it is possible to reduce financing of the government even more.
Because of the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, nearly a week on border with Russia hundreds of trucks stand in a queue.
Today Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and to establish dry closets
In border check-points at entry into Russia hundreds of trucks accumulated.
Such situation arose because of change of rules of customs registration of freights.
The Ukrainian frontier guards and customs officers confirm: the turn is created by the Russian side which did not warn about innovations in advance.
Since October 28 customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures of guaranteeing cargo delivery, - the deputy chief of East customs Vladimir Denisov reported.
The document of a new sample is applied in the countries which joined the convention on international transport.
Check points work in the emergency mode.
The correspondent of "FACTS" visited border and communicated to truckers, the appeared hostages of a situation.
The prices on a check point "Novoazovsk" grow in a roadside little shop cafe every day, as well as line of trucks.
Trucks stand in some ranks, having stretched approximately on two kilometers.
Customs Novoazovsk terminal - Cheerful Voznesenka provides one of the major transport directions from the South of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here freights go to Stavropol Krai Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday till midnight still let, and after introduced these rules, - the trucker Alexey Golovanev complains (of a photo) who is lucky transit through Russia freight from Turkey to Kazakhstan and already nearly a week spends the night in the car.
By new rules to cross border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of an insurance of freight.
The sum depends on the cost of freight and distance on which it is carried.
The minimum insurance - 4,5−5 thousand rubles (about 1100−1300 hryvnias).
Those who goes nearby (we will tell, to Georgia, Armenia) with freight worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the others got stuck - after all anybody with themselves has no such big money!
Represent if the driver is lucky freight for the sum only four thousand dollars, but already to Moscow, it is necessary to pay it 90 thousand rubles (nearly 23 thousand hryvnias) for transit!
Conditions for a survival on border - any, - the truckers who settled complain is near the cars.
In border shops and cafe and so it is always expensive, but such prices as here, we did not meet anywhere!
Sellers oriented and quickly them excited: 15 hryvnias cost a long loaf, seven hryvnias - a glass of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a bowl of soup.
And cafe one.
And the toilet is not present.
In the steppe we sleep, there we go to a toilet.
Neither to be washed, nor to shave...
I can also week not to leave the car, to me the wife to the road prepared everything.
I will stretch week, - other trucker Victor Skotarenko consoles himself.
Whether the turn in a week will only reach my car?
How much you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border little shop.
Is on 11 and on 15 hryvnias.
What, a bottle crystal or water is infused on silver?
We have a cafe, but not shop.
Take, meanwhile still is, - the shop assistant parries.
After the situation started being covered in mass media, paid attention to the power of the region to a distress of the Ukrainian drivers.
The management of the Amvrosiyevsky and New Azov district state administrations received an assignment to provide all who stands idle in turn on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, - the acting as the chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergey Dergunov declared.
Now at check points ambulance crews are on duty.
Also for convenience of people dry closets will be established.
According to the official, the problem connected with turns will be solved already in the next few days.
As the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration reports, as of October 31 at the international check points of "Uspenk" and "Novoazovsk" respectively 32 and 68 cars stood idle.
"FACTS" will watch development of a situation.
Sony counts on lower annual profit
The Japanese producer of electronics, Sony corporation, having finished last quarter with net loss of 19,3 billion yens, or $197 million, reduced the forecast concerning profit for the current fiscal year.
Results of Sony from July till September, 2013 were more depressing, than it was expected that is connected with decline in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers of production of Japanese corporation.
The television business of Sony which in the II quarter brought to the company operating profit, the first for three years, of 5,2 billion yens again fell in the reporting period to 9,3 billion yens of an operational loss.
The Japanese market of consumer electronics goes through difficult times, especially because of decrease in demand for TVs.
And while competitors seek to look for an exit from a difficult situation, Sony continues to concentrate on a consumer segment.
For example, one of the main rivals of Sony, Panasonic corporation, displaces emphases on industrial accessories recently: here sales to the company grow high rates, especially at the expense of automobile systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result by the end of fiscal year which will come to the end in March, 2014, Sony expects to get 179 billion yens of operating profit against 230 billion yens expected earlier.
Thus, according to Thomson Reuters agency, analysts assumed that this indicator will be much higher and will make 221 billion yens.
Seeking to leave crisis, Sony expands a product line.
In the middle of this month start of sales of the "clever" hours from Japanese corporation allocated with a number of fashionable functions which will allow to get rid of need on 100 times a day to get the smartphone from a pocket was declared.
After Sony lowered the annual forecast for profit and revenue, shares of the company at opening of torog in Tokyo lost in the morning in price more than 11%, having decreased to the level of 1668 yens for one action.
How many earn the late celebrities - MK in the USA MK
The rating of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna who earned 125 million dollars.
But it was "surpassed" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October, 2012 to October, 2013 made 160 million.
Considerably other died celebrities which last year "earned" several times less lag behind it.
Elvis Presley - 55 million in a year appeared the second in the list of the most "well-founded" left celebrities made by the Forbes magazine following the results of a year, and a line the author of comics Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million is lower.
Except them Elisabeth Taylor who was last year the leader (25 million) and the musician Bob Marley (18 million) entered the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein also got to the list.
The Social Revolutionary suggests to equate an insult of patriotic feelings to extremism
For legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults directed against Russia "Just Russia" suggests to equate an insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to punish for it five years of prison.
As the Izvestiya newspaper, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the deputy chairman of the State Duma Energy Committee Oleg Mikheyev reports, are already sent for obtaining the conclusion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under patriotic feelings of citizens the author of amendments suggests to understand emotional communication of the person with the country, which citizen it is, characterized by love to this country, the responsible attitude towards its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheyev specifies, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for violation of formal signs of the government - a flag and the coat of arms.
Thus, according to the parliamentarian, protection of Russians which corns can be trodden on by both an insult of the state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, in the Russian legislation is worked insufficiently.
It gives the discussions which are developed annually on the eve of the Victory Day when some media persons dare to call into question a heroic feat of the people of the USSR in fight against fascists as an example.
On the eve of the main public holiday - the Victory Day on May 9 - the real orgy is annually developed.
Practising in wit and "an alternative view" of history, some publicists reach reasonings that, say, what a pity that cultural Germans did not win the wild Soviet Union!
I consider such absolutely inadmissible in the country where pride of history remains main "spiritual skrepy to" the nation", - Oleg Mikheyev is indignant.
Besides, according to Mikheyev, it is much more patriotically adjusted people in Russia, than religious, however thus the law punishes for an insult of feelings of believers, and it is possible to offend patriotic feelings almost with impunity.
According to the people's deputy, it is necessary to equate an insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and to state the corresponding punishment in the 282nd article of the Criminal code.
The bill prescribes punishment for an insult of patriotic feelings: from a 100-thousand penalty to 5 - the summer conclusion.

For control over PMC there is a fight between human rights activists and lobbyists of security officers.
At a meeting of the OP working group on formation of PMC I suggested to make a selection criterion experience of human rights activity.
"It was not accepted, and formed lists, without having developed criteria", - Valery Borshchev tells.
Borshchev - the current chairman of the Moscow supervisory commission and Association of independent observers - the All-Russian structure of the human rights activists dealing with prison problems.
In stay by the deputy of the State Duma from "Apple" he developed the law regulating activity of PMC.
Council of OP has to vote for structures of PMC in 43 regions of the country.
Less than one thousand persons interested apply for 1800 vacant places, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not organize because of the absence of candidates.
OP promises to organize a donabor on vacant places.
PMC of Moscow - one of the few commissions with competition in spite of the fact that in new structure instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in present structure of the capital commission of 11 human rights activists and 9 security officers, and in option which is on vote in OP, the ratio changes on 17 to 23.
Thus 30 human rights activists wanted to get to the capital commission.
But the representative of "A fighting brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can repeatedly be a new part.
He was three years the member of PMC, but never visited prisoners.
Borshchev considers that security officers, having appointed the chairman of PMC, will be able to make work of human rights activists intolerable therefore human rights activists do not expel a collective exit from the commission.
In their opinion, advance of security officers is coordinated by the member of PMC Anton Tsvetkov heading "Officers of Russia" - the organization defending interests of power departments.
"I do not eat babies for breakfast", - declared RBC daily Anton Tsvetkov.
It denies that lobbies promotion of any lists and says that is not going to interfere with human rights activists to visit the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested, for what list now vote in OP.
He considers publication of information by Borshchev as pressure form.
Possible success of human rights activists - the planned change of the management of the Chelyabinsk PMC.
Her former heads will be discharged because of last year's Kopeisk disorders.
In Civic chamber came to a conclusion that the management of the local commission ignored problems of prisoners.
And here the PMC of Rostov-on-Don can pass from human rights activists to security officers.
From new lists the human rights activist chairman of the local commission "was gone", but there was one of his opponents in spite of the fact that in May, 2013 the federal Civic chamber excluded it for unethical behavior.
Borshchev considers lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions as "as revenge for Kopeysk".
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova's exposures did not affect PMC of Mordovia which consider "power": only one human rights activist wanted to get to new structure, and at her did not even accept documents for competition.
The member of council of OP Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that voted against the offered list as he is revolted by a situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
It dispatched the position to other members of council.
His colleague on OP Pavel Gusev says that voted for as it likes the offered Moscow list.
The deputy secretary of OP Vladislav Grib who is also the employee of FSIN Research institute coordinated drawing up lists of PMC.
The mushroom told RBC daily that does not consider correct to divide candidates for human rights activists and security officers and does not agree that at chairmen of the commissions is enough powers to interfere with work of her members.
The mushroom does not undertake to predict results of vote of council of OP.
If the offered list is rejected today, in the next few days for vote will submit the changed option.
Clive Palmer claims that the deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests in a question of a child care leave.
The deputy billionaire Clive Palmer says that the prime minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests in a question of a child care leave because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from this.
This magnate of mining branch who has not settled dispute on payment of a tax on emissions of carbon of $6 million, made this statement when he tried to wave away from questions of, whether there is at it a conflict.
The joint party of Palmer can control to four voices in the senate which can have crucial importance in making decision on cancellation of taxes on emissions of carbon and mining activity.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interests, and told that daughters of Mr. Abbott will personally be the winner from political measures.
"It has a large conflict of interests when it is about the paid child care leave because if any of these daughters will become pregnant, it will have a direct interest in that, they will receive holiday or not" — Mr. Palmer told.
In two months after elections the election commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in fight for a place from Sunshine Coast of the constituency Fairfax with overweight in 53 voices after a vote recount.
Mr. Palmer called for revision of procedure of counting of votes on elections for acceleration of this process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether the decision on these elections be made in two months owes after we voted?
"We need to have more perfect system" — he told.
Why it we should not have such system that it was possible to come, enter the data into the computer, at once to vote and receive result at 18:30 in the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized use of pencils for marks in bulletins.
It because they can erase result if it is not pleasant to someone?
To use a pencil presently it seems strange.
The election commission is engaged in studying of opportunities for electronic vote and recently published the joint debatable document with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer told that his program includes the international airport for Sunshine Coast and it "very seriously" will treat the new work.
The state position assumes service to society.
"We do not achieve any awards, except gratitude of history, that at the critical moment we can serve this district" — he told.
Against the companies Google, Samsung, Huawei claims for the patents Nortel are put forward
The group owning thousands of former patents Nortel submitted on Thursday the whole series of patent claims against producers of mobile phones, including the Google company which price it killed at auction on bankruptcy of Nortel.
The consortium Rockstar which bought the patents Nortel for $4,5 billion submitted claims for violation of patent rights to district court of the USA in the State of Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is in joint property of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violation of seven patents.
These patents cover technologies which help to compare search keywords on the Internet with the advertizing corresponding to them, it is said in the claim that is a basis of search business of Google.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not give comments.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones working at the Android operating system from Google which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011 the Google company offered for the patents Nortel the initial price in $900 million.
Google several times raised the offered price, eventually having offered the whole $4,4 billion.
Having lost the case on the patents Nortel to consortium Rockstar, Google got Motorola Mobility for $12,5 billion, in this transaction the library of patents of the Motorola company was the defining factor partially.
"Despite unsuccessful attempt to get the patents which are a subject of the claim at auction, Google broke and continues to violate them" — it is told in the judicial claim.
Rockstar demands the raised indemnification from Google as it claims that violation of patent rights from Google is deliberate, according to the claim requirement.

This water herdboy was placed in the helicopter going to Aberdeen, last month and then it there was the Scottish office of Society on prevention of ill treatment of animal (SPCA) in the saving center in Alloa.
The manager of the center Colin Seddon told: "This water herdboy, most likely, is the winter migrant from Northern Europe who got to a zone of strong winds over the North Sea".

Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will grow many times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the sizes of penalties will help to bring an order to Vologda and to exempt streets from spontaneous tents and trays.
Most of street dealers do not pay taxes, production which they realize, often does not pass the corresponding sanitary control.
And it means that health of residents of Vologda is threatened.
So, the lower limit of a penalty for citizens for unauthorized trade since November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of Administration of Vologda reports.
In September 600 people were dismissed from automobile plant "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk.
As speak in labor unions, all dismissed received compensation.
However where more sharply, than problems of workers, there is a question of reduction of industrial production in the region.
The deputy of regional Legislative Assembly Alexey Etmanov at a meeting declared that at plant of the Ford company in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, it occurred in September: then according to the program of voluntary dismissal which was developed together with labor union of the organization, from plant about 600 people left.
"Golden parachutes" at a rate of several salaries were offered the workers who decided to leave at own will.
Because of it the vast majority was left by workplaces at own will.
However, according to Etmanov, such number of people is the whole night shift.
I think, business will not be limited to it.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to accept any programs of support of the regional enterprises which are in a difficult situation", - he explained, having added that at adoption of the budget the government does not consider stagnation of production in the region and big reduction of workplaces.
In "Forde" this information is not disproved and not confirmed.
We wait for the answer from the company, and as soon as it appears, surely we will publish it.
Talk on reduction of workers at plant of "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk goes long ago.
So, for example, about plans of the company it became known to dismiss 600 people in September.
Earlier the plant declared a suspension of production of cars.
As the reason at plant called decline in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, following the results of nine months 2013 industrial output in the Leningrad region was reduced by 5,4%.
Production of vehicles and the equipment was reduced by 11,5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: growth rates of GDP of the Russian Federation are insufficient for development of the state
The prime minister Dmitry Medvedev considers insufficient for the Russian Federation growth rates of its GDP and is sure that the situation can be improved, having simplified credit conditions of business and changing structure of the Russian economy, being guided by innovations, reports Reuters.
We planned this year GDP gain around 3%, maybe, even slightly more.
Slightly less than 2% will be real.
Against recession in a number of the countries of Europe seemingly not really badly, but for us it is not enough, because also not so strong economic base as in a number of the countries, and in general to develop, there have to be higher rates.
It is now very important that the Russian companies, the Russian business obtained the normal credits at the normal price is the first that it is necessary to make", - the head of the government emphasized.
The director of "Yugra" Andrey Belmach noted that it is still difficult to tell, what is the time it will be required on search of the new head coach.
This post became vacant after Sergey Shepelev's resignation.
Resignation happened all a few hours ago therefore to tell, what is the time it is required on searches of the new trainer, I am not ready, - Belmacha quotes ITAR-TASS.
Perhaps day.
Perhaps and month.
We study all possible options.
The priority will be given to the Russian expert.
There is no wish to find not simply any trainer, and such person who will work in our club some years and will achieve with it certain results.
The snowboarder for the Olympic note specially was photographed
The bank of Russia on Wednesday released the memorable banknote devoted to the city of Sochi where will pass the Olympic Games this winter.
Note face value - 100 rubles.
But in a network bloggers already actively sneer concerning a memorable banknote.
After presentation of the Olympic note on October 30 they paid attention that the image of the snowboarder from a banknote can be found in photobanks.
In particular - in free storage of a photo of StockExchange where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the lesson of Photoshop published on the Russian site "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
Besides, it was already used in advertizing of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is executed in blue-blue scale.
On the one hand the snowboarder flying over Sochi with another - a type of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird is represented.
The author of design of a banknote - Pavel Bushuyev who won competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of a name of Repin.
On presentation it was noted that some sports - alpine skiing were considered, freestyle and ski jumping, but as a result chose a snowboard as it is rather young sport.
According to the source "News", close to the Central Bank, the regulator the opinion of the public of rather wide dissemination of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote is not indifferent and now study a situation.
And here in Goznake are not too concerned by a sensation round the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service Gosznaka Natalya Nikiforova declared to "News" that all reasonings concerning plagiarism are ridiculous.
The snowboarder on a banknote will turn to the right, in photos in a network - to the left, - Nikiforova specified.
The person on a photoshoot for creation of the note acted from different points, the final image, on it - a characteristic pose of the snowboarder was selected then.
She also noted that laws on copyright do not extend on the Olympic banknote as the artist got paid for work.
According to experts, discussion round the image on the Olympic note is positive at all.
Recognition of the image on the note - plus for its advance, - is considered by the executive director of NP "Rusbrend" Alexey Popovichev.
To prove absolute similarity of images on the note and in photobanks it is quite difficult therefore claims for contest of intellectual property on this image will hardly arrive.
For the first time the Olympic banknote appeared in China - to the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 the memorable banknote in 10 yuans was issued.
Russia decided to support this tradition.

The NSA blames "an internal mistake", but not hackers for termination of work of the site
The National security agency shrouded in secret declared on Friday evening that termination of work of their site at some o'clock was caused by technical failure, but not hackers as it was approved in a network.
"NSA.gov was inaccessible within several hours tonight because of an internal mistake which occurred during planned updating" — reported prospecting agency in the official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Statements that interruption in work was caused by the distributed attack like "refusal in service" [DDoS], are incorrect.
Earlier tonight online systems of monitoring of servers registered that the site of the NSA did not work at least six hours, and the site is still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier the representative of the NSA reported ABC News that the internal confidential network of agency "at all not" was cracked.
No secret information exists in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online group of hackers activists declared that it bears responsibility for a conclusion out of operation of the site of the NSA by means of DDoS-attack.
DDoS-attacks are developed so that to overflow the target site a traffic while servers are not be overloaded and the site does not fail.
Tactics of hackers is rather simple, and attacks are not intended for penetration into an internal network of target system.
Earlier superconfidential NSA which once got the nickname "There Is No Such Agency" appeared in the center of public attention and fierce criticism after series of revelations about its extensive programs of shadowing abroad and within the country in recent months — all this reaction to the confidential files of the NSA stolen from agency and published by the disappointed being employee of the NSA Edward Snowden.
The growing polemic round agency caused rumors that today's incident was result of purposeful actions of hackers.
The head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The beginning of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks start of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom declared.
"There was a sign event today: construction of the Bulgarian site of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe began" — the chairman of Gazprom Alexey Miller said in the statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security of all European continent.
South Stream is intended for diversification of export routes of Russia through Europe.
Dispute under the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine in which there is a most part of the gas of Russia intended for Europe, increases risk level for usual routes, officials speak.
Miller declared that direct connection with Bulgaria, the member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks connected with the transit countries are eliminated "forever".
The Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at reduced price as soon as in 2015 all project starts working.
Gazprom declared that construction has to begin in other countries located further along a gas pipeline route, by the end of the year.
Annual design capacity of the pipeline makes 2,2 trillion cubic foots of natural gas.
Rosbalt agency deprived of the status of mass media for obscene abuse
On October 31 the Moscow City Court decided to recognize invalid the license about registration of Rosbalt agency, - "Tape" writes.
Drew Roskomnadzor on deprivation of agency of the status of mass media - for systematic and gross violations of the law on mass media.
During process unpleasant precedent was created: the court counted possible to close mass media, having actually refused to the edition the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
JSC Rosbalt News Agency was founded in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the next years the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional divisions.
Also representations in the countries of the former USSR work for agency.
Since 2001 "Rosbalt" developed and functioned as federal information and analytical agency.
To the middle of the 2000th the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private internet mass-media in Russia.
Thus "Rosbalt" always occupied quite specific niche: notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies were the center of exclusive publications of agency (and make still).
Talk on proximity of the edition to power structures proceeded throughout existence of agency.
Along with that "Rosbalt" had extensive base of sources in various departments, such assumptions were spoken well also with that the project Natalya was at the head of Chaplin - Victor Cherkesov's wife.
Thus Chaplina's role in the management of "Rosbalt" is up to the end not clear: most often she is called "project manager".
The CEO of agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief - Nikolay Ulyanov.
Recently "Rosbalt" did not appear in ratings of federal mass media - neither on a quoting, nor on audience.
In October the agency took the 25th place in a rating of attendance of the sites of the Russian mass media according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru makes about 150 thousand unique visitors (and to 500 thousand viewings), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials for the last five months - a note about helplessness of the Kremlin in the relations with Ukraine, death of the soloist of King and Clown group, riots in capital Biryulev.
The conflict of "Rosbalt" to Roskomnadzor began in July, 2013 when the amendments to the law on mass media which forbade to journalists obscene abuse came into force.
Department found the forbidden lexicon in two videos published on the site of agency ("The Dzhigit from Krasnodar" and "The Pussy Riot was profaned by oil derricks").
Further the parties describe differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the found video records accused "Rosbalt" of rough and systematic violation of the law about mass media and appealed to court with the requirement to select the license at agency.
In "Rosbalt" declared that claims of department are illegal: first, rollers were not an editorial matter, secondly, abusive words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, right after the prevention rollers were removed from the site.
Representatives of agency appealed against claims of Roskomnadzor in world court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, consideration of these complaints still proceeded.
However already the 25th the magistrate made the decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolay Ulyanov was found guilty of violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and fined 20 thousand rubles - on 10 thousand for each roller.
Obviously, it also predetermined a hearing outcome in Moscow City Court - if to give up thought that the outcome could be predetermined even earlier.
On October 31 the court made the decision to nullify the certificate on registration of "Rosbalt", having actually deprived agency of the status of mass media.
It is impossible to tell that "Rosbalt" during this opposition remained alone.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the application addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov was signed on October 10 by 26 deputies; the document was filed at the initiative of the CPRF).
Illegality of closing of the edition was declared by the head of the Union of journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow union of journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council of human rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the management of Roskomnadzor even provided it some guarantees of that business will not reach revocation of license.
The trial of "Rosbalt" showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be to mass media in Russia today - a big question.
The gene of the speech appeared a stimulator of formation of synapses
Scientists from John Hopkins's University and Medical school Maunt-Sinai found protein thanks to which "a speech gene" Foxp2 carries out the function, stimulating formation of new communications between neurons.
Research is published in Science, on the site of the magazine it is possible to read its summary.
The gene of Foxp2 is the first known gene which function is directly connected with the speech.
It was succeeded to establish its role in 2001 thanks to detection of a family from several people who could not say correctly the word and sometimes even did not understand each other.
Scientists found out that at family members work of a gene of Foxp2, however was broken how it carries out the function, remained it is not known.
In new research biologists showed that at least the part of the Foxp2 functions carries out as a stimulator of formation of new synapses in a brain, the speech connected with formation.
Carries out it it thanks to other gene, SRPX2.
The last was found in a search result of factors which stimulate formation of synapses.
SRPX2 appeared one of 10 similar genes found authors, thus only on its activity viyat Foxp2.
That SRPX2 really influences vocalization, scientists confirmed in experiment on little mice.
When at animals activity of a gene was artificially reduced, they shouted at division with mother less.
If activity of a gene was restored, also the frequency of the made sounds was restored.
Earlier on mice communication with vocalization of Foxp2 was also shown.
Animals to whom entered the human copy of a gene, arquebuse are more active and at lower frequency, than ordinary mice.
Still, however, scientists do not know, whether work of Foxp2 and, respectively, SRPX2 operated by it is connected with purely "mechanical" properties of formation of sounds or thinner processes.
Ponomarev left "Just Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from Just Russia party, the member of its office in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev submitted the application for an exit from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian declared, he submitted the application to Novosibirsk regional office of party.
According to its charter, it automatically means that Ponomarev left ranks of "spravedross".
We sit, we drink tea...
"For some reason many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev Puts the Party Membership Card on a Table", but in it there is nothing of that kind epoch-making", - the deputy commented on the decision.
Ponomarev noted that keeps good relations with regional office of "Social Revolutionaries".
Meanwhile, Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse the mandate of the deputy of the State Duma.
He explained that, despite a desertion of the party, it remains the member of fraction and under the law cannot leave it.
Messages on Ilya Ponomarev's intention to leave Just Russia party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that together with it "SR" will leave Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, however the last soon disproved this information.
Want the ice cream shining in the dark?
The British businessman created the first-ever ice cream shining in the dark by means of a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used fluorescent properties of a sea animal to develop the shining food.
He came to this idea, having read the scientific article about jellyfishes, and convinced scientists of China chemically to recreate the shining protein.
Ice cream reacts with language of the one who eats it, increasing the pH level in protein and forcing it to shine.
Chris says that as ice cream starts shining when reacts to heat of a mouth, it means that the more you lick, the it becomes brighter.
Charlie, the founder of the company on production of Lick Me, I Tasty ice cream, speaks: "It is an improbable thing, but still at the most initial stage if to speak about production therefore you receive about 2 g of substance for £200".
Protein which we use in ice cream, reacts with your language at neutral pH.
Therefore when your mouth warms protein, it will increase the pH level and ice cream will start shining.
We tested it within several last months, and it seemed that it will be ideal to present it to the Halloween because it creates such remarkable shining effect.
It, perhaps, the most expensive ice cream of that I did because the luminescence of a jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about £140.
But it quite pleasant on taste.
The experimental company of Charlie located in Bristol is well-known for the unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and taste of mosaic gold.
But its following creation has to appear even more ambitious.
He told: "I very much want to develop invisible ice cream".
It by definition is impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals of which ice cream consists, but I think that we will find a way to make it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish synthesized by the Chinese scientists

The EU prepares measures of support of Ukraine on a case of economic pressure of Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan for providing Ukraine with gas, and also for achievement of the arrangement with the IMF on the emergency credit if Russia takes any measures in response to possible signing of the contract on association between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.

Thus except the potential credit from the IMF Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union.
Analysts, respondents Reuters, doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are capable to overcome old disagreements about financing terms.
Does not trust in possibility of the reforms necessary for receiving the help, and the international rating agency S&P which lowered on Friday a sovereign rating of Ukraine on one step - to "In -" with "In".
However representatives of the EU say that the IMF can show flexibility in credit conditions, in view of circumstances of Ukraine.
Except the plan of financial support of the country the EU has a reserve option for providing Ukraine with gas which overwhelming part of deliveries now goes from Russia.
Probably, it will be gas from Nord Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The last, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia "isolates" Ukraine.
Analysts consider that such way of reversive deliveries to Ukraine can be used only within several weeks, and probably will lead to decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"Between EU countries and Ukrainians negotiations how to create favorable conditions that Ukraine could import gas from other sources, but not from Russia, or from the same source, but along other routes are held", - the Reuters added a source.

So badly affairs were not since World War II.
Among young this indicator is higher several times.

Syria destroyed the equipment for the chemical weapon
Syria destroyed all declared capacities for production of the chemical weapon, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons recognized.
This first stage of disarmament finished Damascus a day before an established period.
Till November 1 Syria had to destroy the production and other auxiliary objects intended for preparation of fighting toxic agents for application, the BBC reports.
Destruction of reserves of toxic agents or their chemical components has to be complete to the middle of 2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, now toxic agents are in the sealed storages.
The international inspectors went to Syria after on the suburb of Damascus on August 21 during chemical attack were lost, according to the USA, more than 1400 people.
The main task of inspectors was not to waste time - not to allow the Syrian authorities to make more chemical weapon - and to destroy infrastructure for mixing of chemicals and equipment of ammunition.
Now will attentively watch these capacities not to allow their repair.
The following milestone - the middle of November: by this time OPCW and Syrians have to agree on the detailed plan of destruction of already available reserves of toxic agents.
There is a lot of questions.
Where they will be destroyed?
Who will provide for this purpose the equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by the western intelligence services.
They with readiness will advise inspectors new objects for check if there are bases to suspect that Damascus is not up to the end frank.
The USA believe that this attack was carried out by active armed forces.
Syria and Russia insist that this work of the Syrian insurgents.
The world community demanded from the Syrian management - according to the agreement reached with mediation of Russia - to destroy or bring into a non-working state all capacities for production of shells, the poisoning gases and liquids and for filling of shells with these substances.
Now, when this stage is passed, destruction of the chemical weapon which is already available for the Syrian army has to become the following step.
It is supposed that in this arsenal there can be more than 1000 tons of the neuroparalytic toxic agents, skin and vesicant mustard gas and other forbidden chemicals which are stored in several tens different places.
It is necessary for its destruction that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities for a start agreed on the schedule of actions - on it two weeks are taken away.
The head of field operations of OPCW Gerry Smith declared the BBC that his inspectors "personally watched destruction of the equipment".
"They have no possibility of a message further production or mixing of the chemical weapon now", - he told.
In the statement of OPCW it is said that inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced that plants on production of shells and toxic agents either are destroyed, or are put out of commission.
The remained two objects are too dangerous to carry out there inspection, it is told in the document, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by specialists of OPCW.
According to Smith, process of destruction of infrastructure on production of the chemical weapon "was especially difficult" as it was necessary to work in the conditions of the proceeding conflict.
At the beginning of October of OPCW received Nobel Peace Prize, however, according to Smith, time to celebrate it at inspectors was not yet - they were too busy.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives to Scots a choice
One more day, one more horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the all-European zone of free movement as a condition of membership in the EU.
The turn of stories about passport control in Bervike and border with a barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall comes.
However, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated possible economic benefits from more free movements across other Europe though — that is predictable — it did not appear in headings.
Anybody also did not specify that EU Member States spend a lot of time for turning the formal rules as it is convenient to them.
As Scotland is not included now to the Schengen area, continuation of non-compliance with requirements will become a cheap concession for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from Scots.
So it is the history which is not deserving attention.
And such old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard "duck" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
And still there is an interesting moment lost when retelling the ancient fairy tale.
Why in general independent Scotland has to execute orders of Europe?
Why to change a yoke of London for a yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe at last stopped.
With eurocrisis the Europe project is officially dead.
In all European Union the parties opposing the EU or for cancellation of euro as single currency gain strength.
Even in Germany the party of eurosceptics "Alternative of Germany" — founded only in this year — appeared from nowhere and received nearly five million votes on September federal elections, thus in fact having forced out "Free democrats" (analog of ours of "Liberal democrats") from the Bundestag.
Always there was an internal opposition to the plan of creation of federal Europe.
Nevertheless the current economic crisis became a turning point.
The austerity measures entered by Berlin and the European central bank and the fetters imposed on national economies through preservation of single currency led many people to thought that the Europe project went too far.
Crisis of euro is a little connected with that the national governments work at excessive budget deficits — it was fair only for Greece.
Actually the eurosystem blocked the members on the exchange rates favorable to the German exporters — that the German politicians and want to keep.
Without possibility of devaluation of national currency Southern Europe appears in in advance unprofitable situation on production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only life-saver — to cut down salaries and the public expenditures that is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency there is deeper problem of productive abilities of Europe.
As a result of a package of measures on "green" energy, introduced by Brussels — the code meaning subsidizing of the French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer — the European industry pays twice more for electricity four times more for gas, than in the USA.
It paralizuyushche adverse price conditions as we already saw in Greyndzhmuta.
No freezings of salaries in the world will stop a shattering victory of cheap slate gas of the USA over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result becomes ripe revolt, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After war the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and to put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris as in means of obtaining political legitimacy any more, and already imposed own economic policy to Europe, having left the destroyed economy of France in a distress.
Result — the right, opposing the EU Marine Le Pen's party "National front" just won a decisive by-election, having dumped ruling party of socialists on the third place.
"Front" is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of votes now — the timely prevention to the British labourists that it is impossible to proceed from the assumption that split among the right will automatically affect in favor of the left.
What Le Pen with the new found popularity among the French white working class does?
She wants to use elections to the EU next year to create the block in the European parliament against the EU and against single currency.
If — and it is very probable — the parties incited against the EU will get support on these elections, such block will be able to reach for the first time a dominant position in the European parliament.
Here my opinion: soon the growing moods against the EU and against single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it again will become something like indistinct "Europe (sovereign) nations" which was pleasant to General de Gaulle.
Germany and some economies, dependent on it, can keep euro, but France and Southern Europe will restore own currencies.
I assume that Great Britain separates from this project, hoping to approach with the USA.
Nevertheless the growing interest of Washington in the Pacific Ocean indicates probability of that Great Britain will remain unaddressed in cold of Atlantic.
In what situation it leaves Scotland?
We can choose to become the region (in fact) to Small England.
Or we can protect own economic interests that means, in addition, to send Berlin and Brussels to devils.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within more free European arrangement provided that we will keep the currency.
Cooperation with other countries adherents will be simpler in not federal Europe of the nations.
Otherwise we should consider possibility of repetition of experience of Norway and preservation of our economic independence.
The government of the Scotch national game in Scotland is — strangely enough — the most successful political movement in Europe directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 thanks to objections against the cuts in expenditure offered (and realized) the labor chancellor of treasury Alistair Darling and the coalition of the Tory and liberal democrats which arose subsequently.
It would be now ridiculous to Scotland to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
The Australian woman submits the appeal against prison term in Thailand
The 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days of prison on the island Phuket for the false statement that it was attacked by the taxi driver, submitted the appeal on a sentence and was released on the security.
Stevie Rochelle Bemford was originally found on June 15 by Pkhuketsky provincial court guilty of submission of the false claim after the message of police of Thailand that the local taxi driver carried out attack on the night of Sunday June 10 while two other men held it.
However on records of surveillance cameras it became clear later that it safely returned to the hotel after a rupture of the relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Pkhuketsky police interrogated Bemford within two days before it admitted that fabricated this history.
To court she contained in local police chambers.
Bemford it was sentenced to 15-day prison term in the center of the maintenance of prisoners of a general regime on the suburb of Phuket, but not in women's prison for adults.
She is the daughter of the former player of the Australian league Peter Tanks who asked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for the help for the daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that all family "was extremely concerned" by wellbeing of the daughter and waited for it return to Australia.
"It is obvious that it was disturbing time, but we hope that she will safely come back home as soon as possible" — told Tanks.
Bemford submitted the appeal on the sentence and it was released on the security in 50 000 baht.
According to reportings in Australia, at present it spends the holidays in the resort zone Krabi in the southern Thailand.
The legal sources which are in Thailand reported that Bemford represents the local lawyer in Phuket now, but warned that the appeal can lead to that the court will increase its sentence for a period of up to two years and will force it to serve sentence in prison for adults.
However after recent murder of the Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket Thailand can also seek for restoration of the undermined tourist image that will lead to pronouncement of the verdict of not guilty.

Early puberty: aging earlier
Afro-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach a sexual maturity earlier, than their white contemporaries, show researches.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There are no certificates of that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts consider that epidemic of obesity can be one of starting mechanisms of early puberty
The tendency to an early sexual maturity is not so expressed at boys
The former correspondent of CNN Pat Etheridge — the journalist specializing on children's health and family questions.
Whether mother should be frightened if at her daughter rudiments of a mammary gland start being formed and raise pubic hair in 7 or 8 years?
At annual conference of the American academy of pediatrics this week to Orlando, the State of Florida, the children's endocrinologist doctor Paul Kaplovitts explained that these early physical changes are quite widespread among the American girls and represent new norm.
"I spend much time, calming parents — usually it does not mean fast approach of a full sexual maturity" — Kaplovitts told.
Obvious signs of development, such as the growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and a smell of a body, appear at girls earlier.
But there was only a small shift aged to a menarkha (the first periods) for the last four decades.
In the United States middle age makes 12,5 years and decreased in comparison with 12,75 in 1970.
"After the breast starts developing, passes at least two-three years to a menarkha" — Kaplovitts who is also the author of the book "Early puberty at girls told: how to cope with this widespread problem".
Time — the most exact check of how puberty will progress.
Discussion that represents the actual approach of a sexual maturity is conducted, but it is considered "premature" when the increase in a breast is followed by sharp increase in growth till 8 years.
In most cases process will be slowed down or will stop — it that the pediatrician can attentively trace.
Faster progressing can form the basis for analyses at the endocrinologist to exclude serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to detain early periods and to prevent one more consequence: presenilation of bones which eventually can lead to delay of growth and low growth at mature age.
Recommendations about medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on age of the child, a level of development, growth rates and an emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplovitts is careful with drugs, but recognizes that "suppression of puberty can soften behavioural problems and feelings of girls that they differ from contemporaries".
Other big problem is clear: parents simply do not want that their very young daughters had periods.
"They worry about risk of pregnancy or even how they will cope with hygiene questions" — Kaplovitts told.
"It was shock" — one woman at which daughter of periods began in 10 years remembers.
Though there were signs and we spoke about periods, it was not emotionally ready.
It came home from school scared and upset with that it the first among the girlfriends.
There are a lot of advertized theories about the reasons of early puberty.
Nevertheless there are no consecutive proofs of that hormones are guilty of milk or other foodstuff, chemicals in environment or sexual messages in mass media.
At boys — as well as at girls — puberty comes earlier.
Kaplovitts claims that the prerequisite which has the greatest weight, is epidemic of obesity.
In 2001 he helped to conduct research of girls from 6 to 9 years which connects amount of fat in an organism with puberty terms.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are a lot of other promoting factors.
In this country Afro-American and Latin American girls, as a rule, reach a sexual maturity earlier, than their white contemporaries.
There are various explanations.
Around the world early puberty is influenced, most likely, by everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Still riddle: though boys have a face hair and on a pubis appear at younger age, the tendency to full early puberty is not so expressed, as at girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed complexity of this subject.
Emergence of spots and pubic hair meets even at babies and children of yaselny age.
"We have to be careful how we define true approach of a sexual maturity" — Dr. Lawrence Silverman, the children's endocrinologist in children's hospital of Goriyeb to Morristaun, the State of New Jersey told.
Parents should not hesitate to receive the instruction from the pediatrician how to speak with the child.
"It can mean earlier, than it was expected, conversation" — Kaplovitts explained.
If you keep calm, your child, as a rule, will react well.
Girls who blossom early, need confirmation of what even when it occurs before put, this process is a normal part of the life.
To the head of Dagestan extremism notes are heard in the anthem of Kuban
The football match between "Anzhi" and "Kuban" poured out in a political collision between the authorities of Krasnodar Krai and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban began to sound differently.

RBS discharges two currency traders
The royal bank of Scotland temporarily discharged of work of two traders in the division on currency transactions, according to information of two people familiar with this situation that is one more confirmation of that global check by regulators of alleged manipulations in the currency market promptly grows.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the investigations connected with the world's largest financial market which daily turn makes $5,3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS discharged during the developed investigation which has something in common with the scandal connected with manipulations with an interbank rate of LIBOR.
Having refused to comment on discharges, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for providing information from regulators.
"Our current investigation of this question proceeds, and we completely cooperate with FCA and other our regulators" — reported in bank two weeks ago.
Last month the informed persons told that RBS transferred records of e-mail and instant messages which received and the former trader, to regulator of Great Britain — to Management on control of financial activity (FCA) sent it.
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and, as far as we know, it was granted leave at its current position of the head of the European spot currency auction in JPMorgan.
Rokhan Ramchandani, the head of the European spot auction in Citi, went on leave this week while Matt Gardiner, the former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was discharged of work as Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were not accused of any violations.
The group of contacts of instant messages of Mr. Asher included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to the informed persons.
The UBS bank reported this week that it took measures against some employees after the Swiss Finma regulator told that he investigates alleged manipulations in the currency market in a number of the Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European commission, Finma, antimonopoly authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the Ministry of Justice of the USA and Currency management of Hong Kong — consider statements that bankers entered arrangement for impact on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for providing information from regulators, persons, familiar with a situation, told.
Banks look through instant messages and e-mails for some years in search of cases of offenses.
News about checks stirred up traders in the field of activity which was in recent years one of the largest sources of the income of trade divisions of investment banks which this year, however, met difficulties in view of the fact that low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for dealers.
Some bankers tried to diminish gravity of a situation, saying that the extensive and highly liquid currency market cannot almost be manipulated, but the senior traders say that it is not always right.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of the daily auction in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity between various trade platforms and wider use of the internal platforms by banks means that "you can start having impact on the market for absolutely small price".
This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse bank declared that dismissed one of traders of the department of the share auction of the London exchange this week after that caused losses of nearly 6 million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified appropriate authorities and cooperates with the regulators.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that this question managed to be localized" — reported Credit Suisse.

John Kerry says in the unprecedented recognition that espionage of the USA "came improperly far"
John Kerry showed mitigation of tactics of protection of programs of tracking of the USA, having made unprecedented recognition that in certain cases espionage of the USA "came improperly far".
The Secretary of State also recognized that is guilty, along with Barack Obama, that was "on the autopilot" during emergence of loud exposures of Edward Snowden about espionage activity of the NSA.
These information leakages put the U.S. Government in the center of diplomatic scandal with the allies.
Speaking by video conference at open government conference in London, Mr. Carrey told: "There are no doubts that the president and I, and also other members of the government actually apprehended some occurring things on the autopilot because such opportunity already existed — both during World War II, and in very difficult years of cold war, and, of course, on September 11".
Then he became the first high-ranking member of the government of the USA who recognized that espionage of the USA went too far, but emphasized that the nobody's rights were not violated.
He told: "In certain cases it came improperly far.
And the president is full of determination to shed light on the matter and to speak before people, and now carries out the careful analysis in order that anybody had no feeling of abuses.
I assure you, abuses concerning innocent people in this process are not present".
Mr. Carrey insisted, however, that the NSA worked from good motives and that its operations of tracking saved many lives.
He added: "We work in the new world where people are ready to blow up themselves.
In the world there is a radical extremism, reckless and full of determination to kill people, to blow up people and to attack the governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, to stop it before it occurs?
We actually prevented crashes of planes, explosions of buildings and murder of people because we could learn about these plans in advance".
Meanwhile the American legislators will go to Europe to help to resolve the questions connected with alleged espionage of the USA abroad and to convince Europeans of need to continue joint anti-terrorist actions with the USA, the chairman of subcommittee of the Senate on the European affairs on Thursday told.
Senator from the State of Connecticut Chris Murphy told that talked to members of the European parliament and other persons this week and is concerned by their threats to stop participation in the anti-terrorist organizations because of disappointment in connection with the shadowing which is carried out by National security agency.
"It is really important for interests of national security of the USA that Europeans remained our supporters concerning our common anti-terrorist efforts — the democrat Murphy working in a position the first term and being the chairman of subcommittee of the international relations of the Senate on the European affairs in interview from Washington told.
— And I go to Europe to let to them know that we have to continue to cooperate in area of fight against terrorism, despite their anger concerning these programs of the NSA".
News about that the NSA collected millions of records of telephone conversations in Europe, worsened the relations with some allies of the USA though the agency head declared this week that they were inexact and reflected misunderstanding of metadata which were collected by allies on NATO and which they shared with the USA.
The documents published by Snowden testifying that the NSA carried out monitoring of the mobile phone of the German chancellor Angela Merkel, and also phones about 34 other world leaders were provided in other exposures.
The director of the national intelligence James Klapper protected espionage activity concerning allies as necessary and told that this commonplace from both parties.
Against this sensation of Murphy told that his office will organize a trip of Congressmen which, as expected, will take place this year, and that he hopes that members of both parties and both chambers will be a part of delegation.
Names of other participating legislators have to be sounded in the next few days.
According to him, the program of a trip still at a development stage.
Though Murphy declared that a purpose of visit is assistance to improvement of the relations, he told that some degree of "rigidity from the best motives" will also be shown.
He told that the European leaders have to be honest with the people in what espionage programs they used for many years.
"While we can change our programs of tracking better to protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to agree with that fact that we not only who is engaged in prospecting activity" — Murphy told.
Meanwhile Mr. Carrey has to go to these days off to the Middle East and to Poland for the solution of problems of hostility concerning strategy of the USA in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and also prospecting activity of the USA.

But Mr. Chen admitted on television subsequently that he took bribes for writing of false articles about the company with the state share of property.
Now "The new express" has to pass "process of full correction of mistakes" as reports the regulator.
The order on "correction of mistakes" came from Guandunsky management in the sphere of the press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
Preliminary investigation showed that the Novy Express newspaper belonging to Yangcheng Evening News Group published some false reportings on the Zoomlion company registered at the exchange during the period from September, 2012 to August, 2013.
"The management of edition "Of the new express" was disoriented" — said in the statement of the regulator.
He reports that the decision "is made to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Uentschzhou in the form of a response of its reportorial license".
He also "instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group company to carry out full correction of mistakes in "The new express" and recommended to it to make investigation concerning the responsible persons of the newspaper connected with a situation and immediately to make changes to an administrative board of "The new express"".
Mr. Chen wrote some articles for "The new express" in which declared financial violations in the company which is engaged in the construction equipment under the name Zoomlion.
After he was detained, its newspaper published on the front page two appeals to its release, having declared that it supports its journalistic activity.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on the state television with recognition that he published false articles for money.
"In this case I caused damage to the Zoomlion company, and also all news media industry and its ability to be credible the public" — he told the state broadcasting company CCTV.
I made it mainly because I was eager for money and glory.
I realized the fault.
After recognitions of mister Chen "The new express" published apologies on the front page, having declared that the newspaper did not manage to check its reportings properly.
Recently some high-ranking suspects made recognitions on television.
Experts say that practice of knocking-out of recognitions is still widespread in China everywhere, despite recently adopted amendments to laws forbidding to the authorities to force someone to self-accusation.

The technical saving group from fire station of Klekhiton hurried to a scene, went down on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used carrying to lift it uphill.

It was directly on the middle of a steep slope — 50 foots to top and to the earth.
It did not set also a muscle during rescue, it absolutely stiffened.
But now it as it should be.
Then she ate cookies.
It was very unusual call.
That fact that noticed a dog, is improbable.
The specialist officer of saving group Peter Lau told: "Ruby was very lucky that her rescued".
There was a probability that it could suffer very serious injury or than that is worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian to survey, and it was established that with it everything is all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall from Halifax, the Western Yorkshire, told: "It was terrible to watch rescue".
I could not believe that it in general there was.

We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely tremendous.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitli added: "We were afraid that it can fall, but it remained there".
Firefighters were amazing.
I cannot simply believe that it appeared there.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was small, the Halloween was magic.
To us allowed to eat candies with the sister, late not to go to bed and arrange a masquerade for our area.
Now I resemble the miser more.
I did not volunteer to distribute in the last two years candies in the apartment and, most likely, I will not become and this year.
However the statistics shows that I am the black sheep in that, as for the Halloween.
According to National federation of retail trade, most of Americans — namely 158 million — will celebrate the Halloween this year and will spend in total $6,9 billion for candies, suits and jewelry.
The only thing that I wait for each Halloween — is trends.
The national federation of retail trade predicts that on suits $1,2 billion from the spent $6,9 billion will leave.
This year at the height of fashion sexual inanimate objects.
It is not obligatory for women to be representatives of sexual professions any more; they can also be sexual food, for example pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think, we will see a great number of the zombie thanks to "Walking dead persons", and I am sure that astronauts in style of Daft Punk group will get to our tapes Instagram this year.
According to Google, suits which look for most often — it is the zombie, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps, there is nothing bad in traditional approach.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, we were not only.
Moreover, according to National federation of retail trade, Americans will spend this year $330 million for suits for pets.
It means many ridiculous dogs-hotdogov.
When business reaches candies, we do not waste time on trifles.
Americans will spend for them $1,9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen company.
These are about 600 million pounds of chocolates of Hershey, sugar candies, Milk Duds candies, the Twizzlers chewing candies and bars of Clark Bar.
According to the Ministry of Trade of the USA, it is excellent news to 41 million demanding candies of children which were going to submit our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and — we will not deceive ourselves — we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during the Halloween.
The only thing that we do not want to use — these are candies in the form of corn grains; and nevertheless, according to National association of confectioners, nearly 35 million their pounds are on sale under the Halloween.
These are about 9 billion separate corn kernels.
It is a riddle which I still should solve.
Anything so does not express the Halloween essence as haunted houses.
They have tremendous names, for example "Horror behind walls" (which, by the way, is in the real prison), "Howl also shout" and "The house of shock".
Moreover, according to society America Haunts, in America there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses generating about $500 million the income, and also those tremendous photos where you were almost described which your friend laid out on Facebook, and you cannot clean, and then that guy who is pleasant to you, sees this photo and leaves the comment it seems "a cool look".
And in summary we will talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown acquainted us with Great Pumpkin when we were children, and cutting of the lamp of Jack — it as decoration of a Christmas fir-tree, that we do since the childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion on the child in pumpkin began only last year thanks to Pinterest so the majority of us grew, cutting out these pumpkins, but without sitting in them.
According to bureau of population census of the USA, this year Americans will spend about $106 million for pumpkins.
Jack's lamp which is slowly drying on your porch probably arrived from the State of Illinois which grew up 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want a task more difficult, visit Tim and Susan Metisdon in the city of Napa of the State of California and try to cut out something from their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.

At owners of pawnshops in Singapore affairs go well while the middle class experiences difficulties
In a pawnshop in shopping center Bendemir in Singapore Dzhanani Amirtkhalinga puts a gold bracelet, a ring and earrings to pay school training of the daughter.
"My husband and I just bought the house so all my money is invested there" — Mrs. Amirtkhalinga speaks.
Though she also earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as the administrator and her husband too works, it is not enough monthly income of a family, she speaks.
Really, demand — where the volume of debt of households grows in various parts of Southeast Asia — such is that ValueMax where she carries out the transaction, this week became the third pawnshop registered at stock exchange of Singapore.
The credit on the security of jewelry — it not simply fast way to receive money (S$1300 in case of Mrs. Amirtkhalinga), but also is almost also cheap, as the poor bank credits.
Usually pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate in 17% — slightly higher than 15,4% offered in office of United Overseas Bank, the local creditor with branch in the same shopping center.
However pawnshops have that advantage that they do not demand check of solvency or proofs of a salary and can issue the credits quicker, than banks.
Therefore millions of people in all region address in pawnshops as families feel pressure because of increase of cost of life and rapid growth of debt of households and consumer debts.
After five years of the steady growth which followed world financial crisis, and the cheap credits fed with a free monetary policy in the countries with developed economy, families handle the low and average level of the income in pawnshops to compensate reduction of the income in process of delay of growth of their economies.
This week Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, specified increase in a family credit shoulder, generally because of growth of a mortgage, as risk factor for solvency of Asian banks.
It declared that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of a debt of households to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia headed this list from 80% of GDP in comparison with 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned by the high level of a consumer debt in Thailand which this week hardly left technical recession.
On Thursday data showed the proceeding decrease in export and weakening of a consumer demand.
"An essence that with an increase in prices people in the middle and lower part [a scale of the income] will look for ways to fill up the income where will be able only" — tells Song Seng Woon, the economist of CIMB, Malaysian bank.
Record-breaking high prices of gold in the last two years strengthened haste with which people put the personal belongings as they use opportunity to receive money for the family jewelry.
In Singapore about 70% of the things put in 200 lombard points of the city-state are gold products.
People speak: "Price of gold looks good, let's put a gold chain of the grandmother and we will receive it back next month".
In Thailand the largest operator of pawnshops of EasyMoney observed growth of number of the clients using its offices in recent months up to 20%.
Growth in lombard business such is that ValueMax, the operator of office in Bendemire and 15 of others same in Singapore, plans to extend not only in the next Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia too, Yeakh Li Ching, the executive director of ValueMax speaks.
The company will finance expansion, using 60 percent from S$66 million attracted this week as a result of placement of shares at stock exchange of Singapore.
While some creditors caused criticism fire because of high interest rates, Mrs. Yeakh says that the pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs, than other creditors, it also does not increase a debt directly.
"Clients put subjects which they already own, and monetization of personal assets does not increase debt of households" — she speaks.
The mortgage wins more and more wide public recognition as means for receiving short-term, provided financing.
And thus use pawnshops not only those categories of people which are in a difficult financial position.
Rich people in Singapore also use offices of ValueMax, putting gold ingots or hours of Rolex which can give to 60 percent from their purchased cost cash.
We see clients from all sectors of society.
"They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for short term for commercial projects or investments, or small business which need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties" — Mrs. Yeakh speaks.
They sometimes simply need money very quickly.

The Russian security officers do not know of Brotherly Circle group - Noviye Izvestia
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed circle in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
"After in mass media there were messages on entering by the U.S. Treasury Department of Leps into check lists on suspicion in belonging to the Euroasian criminal syndicate 'Brotherly Circle', we saw all databases, but such group did not find", - the interlocutor of agency told.
In his opinion, distribution of this information promotes maintenance of the myth about so-called Russian mafia which allegedly works abroad.
As wrote earlier, yesterday the U.S. Treasury Department published the list of alleged members of criminal group "Brotherly Circle" on the site.
Among them also the Russian singer Grigory Leps was called.
It appears in the list as "Grisha", laid out the day before.
They coincide with data of the popular Russian performer.
Are specified an exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, a creative pseudonym, a place and date of birth.
Besides Leps, five more people are mentioned there.
Two Russians, the citizen of Israel, the citizen of Uzbekistan and one more native of the former USSR, whose nationality is not specified.
Of the USA are sure that Grigory Leps who lives on the island Phuket transported for bandits money by their order.
The photo of the singer is attached to this message and all his data which are true are specified.
Moreover, Leps really bought recently the house on Phuket.
In department noted that they intend to impose sanctions concerning Leps.
Entering of the person in black lists of the American Ministry of Finance involves blocking of its assets to the USA and a ban on business contacts with it of the persons living in the United States.
The assistant Lepsa Maiya Serikova declared that any notices to the singer did not arrive: "It is difficult to answer a question, whether that is Grigory about whom all speak now in connection with scandal in the USA".
Everything that knows Leps are data of mass media.
Officially to it personally there were no notices though I do not know, whether there are they in such cases.
"And, of course, it everything, on the one hand, ridiculously, and with another - is surprising and unexpected", - she declared RIA Novosti.
According to her, on Phuket Grigory Leps does not live, but as approves the Ministry of Finance of the USA, on the Thai island it really has a house.
She declared that now Leps is in long Far East and Siberia tour, and that news found it during flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Black box at you in the car?
Still American designers of roads try to find money for repair of the scattered system of highways, many start seeing the decision in the small black box which is accurately attached on the dashboard of your car.
These devices tracing everyone proyezzhayemy the motorist mile and transferring this information to officials are in the center of a disputable attempt of modernization of outdated system of financing of highways of America made by planned bodies of Washington and staff.
Usually boring arena of planning of highways unexpectedly generated intensive debate and picturesque alliances.
Libertarians joined ecological groups in lobbying of providing the right of use of small boxes to the government for tracking of quantity proyezzhayemy you miles and even, perhaps, where you pass them, - and uses then this information by drawing up tax accounts.
Movement of tea drinking shocked.
The American union of civil liberties is also deeply concerned and lifts a number of questions of rather private life.
And though the congress cannot agree, continue yet or not, some states are not going to wait.
They reflect how within the next decade it is possible to pass to system at which drivers pay for each mile of the road which they pass.
Thousands of motorists already took these black boxes part from which have function of satellite tracking on testing.
It is really necessary for our country.
"It not that question on which we can have an option", – Hassan Ikhrata, the executive director of Association of the governments of South California who prepares plans at first of tracking by authorities of the state of miles, proyezzhayemy each Californian motorist, for 2025 told.
There will be changes how we pay these taxes.
Technologies for this purpose already are.
Need of it is aggravated with lack of means at Government Fund of the construction of highways financed by taxes which Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans do not buy a lot of gasoline, as earlier any more.
Cars pass more miles on one gallon.
The federal tax, 18,4 cents for gallon, did not raise 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise a tax even on one cent at the high prices of gasoline.
"The tax on gasoline cannot simply be kept", – Li Mannich, the expert in transport policy at University of Minnesota told.
In its staff it was established on cars of 500 tracing devices for testing of system of pomilny payment recently.
"It will be the best alternative in the long term", – he told.
Bores call it a pomilny user payment.
No wonder that this idea attracts city liberals as by means of taxes it will be possible to change character of trips for decrease in load of roads and emissions of greenhouse gases, for example.
Planned bodies in California look narrowly at this system during development of strategy for achievement of the target indicators established by ambitious laws of this state on fight against global warming.
However the member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (the republican, Pennsylvania), the chairman of transport committee of chamber, told that he too considers this system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Adherents of the free market in Reason fund of also delighted that will force drivers to pay for each mile.
"It not simply a tax which will go to a black hole", – Adrian Moore, the vice-president for political affairs of Reason told.
People directly pay for that they receive.
This movement is also supported by two former Ministers of Transport of the USA who in 2011 urged the congress to move in the direction of pomilny payment.
The senate of the USA approved the pilot project worth 90 million dollars in which about 10 000 cars would take part last year.
However leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this offer because of fears of the rural legislators representing voters who in everyday life quite often should pass many miles to reach for work or to the city.
Some states and the cities, nevertheless, go on this way independently.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the State of Oregon where for participation in the largest experiment in the country 5000 drivers are attracted.
These drivers will pay staff for run miles instead of a tax on gasoline soon.
In Nevada the pilot project is already complete.
In New York it is considered.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with participation of trucks.
And the coalition of I-95 which includes transport departments of 17 states of east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studies as they will be able to carry out these changes.
This concept was not generally recognized.
In Nevada where about 50 cars of volunteers were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned by that the government can trace each their step.
"Concern about "the big brother" and similar things represents a big problem", – Alauddin Khan managing questions of strategy and management of efficiency in department of transport of the State of Nevada told.
It was not that people wanted.
When tests went at full speed, the office of the American union of civil liberties in the State of Nevada warned on the website: "It will be absolutely simple to turn these devices into devices of full-scale tracking".
There is no need to create huge, bulky technological infrastructure which will inevitably extend for storage of records about daily movements of certain citizens.
Nevada - one of several states where difficult searches of inexpensive technology which would allow authorities of the state to keep account proyezzhayemy the car of miles, but without information on a place and time are conducted.
If you are able to make it, Khan told, society will feel more quietly.
Searches of this technology led some agencies of staff to the small young company in California under the name True Mileage.
Initially this company was not engaged in assistance in taxation of staff.
She sought to enter an emerging market of a type of car insurance at which drivers pay on the basis of run.
But devices which it tests, involve designers of roads because they do not use GPS and provide limited amount of information, periodically loaded by means of the modem.
"People will be more inclined to do it if you do not trace their speed and do not trace their location" — Ryan Morrison, the executive director of True Mileage told.
There were some big mistakes in some of these pilot programs of staff.
There are much less expensive and less persuasive ways to make it.
In Oregon designers experiment granting various options to drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can refuse absolutely the device, having decided to pay instead the fixed collecting on the basis of average of miles which is passed by all inhabitants of staff.
In other places hope to sell idea of the guarded public, having forced devices to do more, and it is not less.
In New York transport officials seek to develop the nalogooblagayushchy device which will also accept payment on parking counters, to provide "pay as you go" an insurance and to collect a pool of data on speed in real time from other drivers which motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists will be recruited by benefit which to them will be offered" — it is told in the document of town-planning design.
Some designers of transport systems, however, reflect on, whether all talk on pomilny payment by simply huge distracting factor is.
In the city transport commission in the field of the gulf San Francisco officials say that the congress could overcome very simply bankruptcy of confidential Fund of construction of highways, having lifted taxes on gasoline.
The additional single or annual tax could be raised from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons, whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline that they paid the fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention when all you need to do is — it to take aspirin" — Randi Rentshler, the director of the commission on the legislation and the public relations told.
If we make it, hundreds of millions drivers will worry about the private life and a set of other things.
Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will build in a dignity of new cardinals of Catholic church for the first time for the term of the service on February 22 as declared Vatican on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in Catholic church after the father, and they elect fathers so Francis will appoint the first group of people who will participate eventually in a choice of his successor.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However after achievement of 80-year age by the cardinal he cannot take part in the father's elections any more — it is a prerogative of group of 120 "cardinals-electors".
Declaring this news, the press secretary of Vatican father Federico Lombardi told that before a construction ceremony in a dignity the meeting of all current cardinals known as a consistory will be held.
"Pope Francis decided to report in advance about the decision to call a consistory in February to facilitate planning of other meetings with participation of cardinals from different corners of the world" — Lombardi told.
Jack Valero from the Catholic Voices organization told that by February the number of cardinals-electors probably will decrease.
He told that usually the father calls so many cardinals, how many it is necessary again to finish number of cardinals-electors to 120, and also so many cardinals are aged more senior than 80 years, how many he will wish.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first from the moment of Francis's election in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment there is some kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
"It will be interesting to look, whether the new father of cardinals from other regions of the world for restoration of balance will appoint" — he noted.
In South America live forty percent of Catholics, but they are presented by insignificant number of cardinals.
It will also be the first elected cardinals since formation of cardinals by Francis Soveta — groups of eight cardinals from around the world it is entrusted to them to look for ways of reforming of church.
In the past the father solved everything independently.
"Now Francis elected eight cardinals that they helped him" — Valero told.
He told that "it is quite possible" that Francis will address to cardinals for council.
But we were not in such situation before — all this for us for the first time.
Valero told that fathers usually built in a position of the cardinal of bishops from large arrivals, but Francis "is full of surprises — therefore we do not know whom he will call".

The tax for foreign owners of real estate will lead to that the London bubble will burst
The treasury executed a preliminary estimate of a measure for a tax on a capital gain, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborn who in the budget of 2012 entered a rate of the state tax of 7% for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in association, but not as natural persons.
At the moment the state duty on residential real estate in the Areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea making 708 million pounds in 2012/13 financial year already exceeds total amount across Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, the northwest, Yorkshire and Humber together taken.
Mr. Cook declared: "After increase in the state duty at expensive houses and introductions of the legislation connected with it against evasion it is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive real estate is underestimated irrespective of influence outdated municipal tax system".
"But this step can lead to that some foreign investors will reluctantly buy real estate in London or her current owners will not want it to sell" — he added.
The cost of the first-class real estate — the top 5–10% of housing market at the price — in a rich southwest belt of London which stretches from Fulkhem to Wimbledon, grew by record 11,8% for last year.
According to research of the Savills company, the price in the center of London continued to show steady growth of 5,6% in annual calculation, but they were eclipsed by actively developing "domestic market" with splash in the prices in the southwest, in the North (7,4%) and in the east of (6,5%) the cities.
The next meeting of Association of mechanicians of the Tyumen region took place on the basis of Yalutorovsky automobile plant.
Within action there passed the presentation of the new line on production of electrowelded pipes from steel.
As the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov told, in 2011 with the advent of the new owner market research on studying of a sales market of steel structures in the Tyumen region is conducted.
It became clear that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electrowelded pipes a month.
After that the decision on change of a profile of plant and installation on it of the equipment for their production was made.
This year more than 7 thousand tons of the made production are shipped.
Investments into plant made more than 120 million rubles, - Denis Gribanov told.
In October the new camp that allows to increase the range is started.
At plant is issued as a small profile of a pipe which is used for hothouse economy, of small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for construction branch.
We plan to reach level of production of 50 thousand tons of production a year that will make about 10 percent from its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite transition to other kind of activity, number of employees at the enterprise it was not reduced - now it makes 157 people, in plans when purchasing the new equipment - increase in the personnel even more than on 50 workers.
At the enterprise there is a retraining of personnel, and necessary experts are selected from the already available.
Next year it is planned to enter the new unit of the longitudinal became sharp up to five millimeters thick that will allow to reduce product cost, and also one more camp, with a speed of production of a pipe to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014 at the enterprise are going to master release of pipes which are used in housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets a task to close to 70 percent of need of the Tyumen region for this production.
The deputy director of department of investment policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing to heads of productions, advised to pay bigger attention to modernization of machine-building enterprises.
Forms of the state support of the industry which include compensation of interest rates for the credits for purchase of the new equipment and expenses on its leasing also are directed on it.
In the current year is provided to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two thirds of this sum are already spent.
The last commission which will consider contracts of subsidizing, accepts documents from the enterprises till November 15.
Besides, the budget compensates costs of participation of local producers in the international fairs.
Next year the budget provided means of 150 million rubles which can be used for compensation of leasing payments and the credits for acquisition of the new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - on programs of energy saving.
Decrease to 72 million rubles of funds for compensation of the ordered and paid equipment which is made in the south of the Tyumen region for an oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the long term this form of support will stop as compensation of a tax on mining which the oil companies paid in the regional budget was motive of its introduction.
Now they do not do it and subsidies become direct account obligations of the region.
Taking into account it the government of area considers as the priority direct support of the industrial enterprises, but not financing through them oil branch.
The help of the budget will be connected with investment projects which will begin to be realized on production.
Many heads of the enterprises expressed concern in connection with the developing situation in the relations with oil industry workers.
The grant for the equipment bought by them is competitive advantage of the industry of the South of the Tyumen region, and at its cancellation it will be difficult to compete at the price with a midland of Russia, where cheaper labor.
Besides, the question with continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - the Rosneft company which does not place the orders at the Tyumen enterprises yet is not clear.
The agreement on implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and demands for its extension did not arrive.
Now the enterprises of the South of area which specialize on the equipment for oil and gas sector, cannot create a portfolio of orders next year.
Open is a question, whether taxes from the oil extracted in the Uvat area will come to the budget of the region or they will be paid in a place of registration of the new owner of fields.

Syria destroyed the means of production of the chemical weapon, the supervisory group speaks
Syria destroyed the capital equipment for production of the chemical weapon and ammunition with the poisoning gas, the international supervisory group while violent confrontations stormed in the north of the country, near one of objects where as believe, toxic substances are stored declared on Thursday.
Also on Thursday the Syrian group of activists declared that more than 120 000 people were killed since the beginning of civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for a ban of the chemical weapon was made in one day prior to
the deadline on November 1 established by this organization which is based in the Hague in order that Damascus destroyed or "made disabled" all means of production of the chemical weapon and mechanisms allowing to mix chemicals with receiving the poisoning gas and to fill with it ammunition.
End of that is on the substance of an initial stage of destruction — an important milestone in the ambitious schedule which sets as the purpose to destroy all chemical weapon of Damascus to the middle of 2014.
Destruction of the equipment means that Syria cannot make the new chemical weapon more.
Nevertheless Damascus still should begin destruction of the existing weapon and stocks.
The country as believe, has about 1000 metric tons of chemicals and the weapon, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
This statement was made during heavy fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira in which, according to experts, there is an object on production of the chemical weapon, and also a place of its storage, reports the Syrian center of protection of human rights which is based in Britain.
The group of activists which traced losses through a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120 296 people were lost.
From this number as it was told, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the government, the group declared, 29 954 persons are members of armed forces of the president Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government fighters and 187 - the Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the dead as it is said in the statement, there were 2202 army deserters and about 5375 fighters of opposition, many of them foreigners.
According to an assessment of the UN of July 25, 100 000 died in the conflict since March, 2011.
Since then this figure was not updated.
The conflict compelled about 2 million people to run from the country.
Assad's troops battled some weeks in Safire to insurgents, many of which are connected with groups of Al-Qaeda.
The center declared that on Thursday there were victims from both parties, but did not provide concrete data.
Fights emphasized danger which the chemical weapon inspectors adjusted by tight deadlines of the mission for disposal of Syria of a toxic arsenal in the middle of the proceeding civil war face.
In the statement of OPCW which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, it is told that its team "was satisfied now that it checked and saw destroyed all crucial means of production declared by Syria and the equipment for mixing/gas station".
She added that "no additional inspection activity is planned now".
Earlier this week inspectors declared that they finished the first round of work on check, having visited 21 of 23 objects declared by Damascus.
They could not visit two places for safety reasons, inspectors declared.
On Thursday the OPCW declared that both places were, according to the statement of Syria, "thrown and... the subjects of the program of the chemical weapon which are in them were moved to other declared places which were checked".
It was not succeeded to find out at once, whether there was an object in Safire one of two places which inspectors of OPCW could not visit.
Syria submitted the plan of elimination of the chemical weapon which has to be approved next month by the OPCW executive committee.
"I welcome courage and bravery which all of you showed in performance of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization" — the CEO of supervisory group Ahmet Uzyumdzhyu in the comment published by OPCW told.
The third year civil war pushes together insurgents, generally the Sunni Muslims, with Assad's government and his security forces which consist of members of his sect of Alawites, branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman told that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday on object of air defense in the coastal province of Syria Latakia.
The cause of explosion is unknown, he told.
Message: the campaign headquarters of Obama considered Biden's exception in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to the president Barack Obama secretly considered possibility of replacement of the vice-president Joe Biden with the candidacy of Hillary Clinton in the electoral list of 2012.
This opening — the brightest sensation from all of the expected Mark Galperin and John Haylemann's book about campaign of 2012 "Rates are doubled: Game changed 2012".
The The Times edition received a copy preparing for a publication of the book and reported on Thursday evening that the next Assistants to the President conducted "large-scale researches in focus groups and polls at the end of 2011" to estimate, whether Biden's exception can help to lift the dying-away hopes for Obama's re-election.
According to the political analyst of The Times Johnathan Martin, the book gives the detailed description of attempt of the high-ranking officials of the campaign headquarters and the White house, namely the former head of administration of the White house Bill Daley, to estimate, what effect will render on vote appointment being the Secretary of State Clinton the vice-president.
Possible replacement was the secret which is carefully protected in the Chicago campaign headquarters and in the Oval office.
Only six next advisers to the president — including Daley, the former head of the campaign headquarters of Obama Jim Messinu and the former senior advisers of the White house of David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that replacement is considered.
The book "Rates Are Doubled" claims that Daley was the initiator of attempt to replace Biden, despite them "the close personal relations", but finally refused this step when their data showed that addition Clinton in the electoral list not "will improve significantly Obama's chances".
In interview to Martin Daley confirmed that the administration really considered possibility of replacement of Biden Clinton.
"I actively supported consideration of a set of things, and it was one of them" — Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that at that moment the president was in an awful form so we thought: "About my God, what to do to us?"
Though Daley characterized research as "necessary check", Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson to Cooper that the campaign headquarters enclosed in studying of quite a lot, whether will bring this step dividends on vote.
"The campaign headquarters do not spend such sums of money for polls and focus groups if they do not consider something seriously" — Martin in the program of joint stock company 360 told.
Whether not clearly, however, Obama knew that his team studied possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley, whether the boss of that time knew it about a possible reshuffle.
Though Daley also told that he does not think that the president "was aware" of possible replacement, the former head of administration recognized that, "probably", Obama knew.
Martin added that "Rates are doubled" does not give a definite answer on a question, whether results of political sounding reached Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin, whether seriously he considers that Obama did not know about research of opportunity to exclude Biden from the electoral list.
"Probably" — Martin answered.

Legislative ban forced Russians to drink less beer
The Russian brewers have a bad mood.
On their estimations, consumption of beer in the country next year remains at former level, and it at best.
Though businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all this year develops for them unsuccessfully: sales fell to 7 percent.
The head of one of the largest breweries of the country, the chairman of the board of the Union of the Russian brewers Isaak Sheps at the III annual conference of Institute of Adam Smith told "Goods of daily demand in Russia" which just came to the end in Moscow of all this.
On it discussed state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012 the Russian market of beer was already reduced by 18 percent as in recent years in the country essential strengthening of regulation of brewing branch regarding production and a turn of beer - drink with the small content of alcohol is observed, - told to listeners of Sheps.
In one country of the world there is no such rigid restriction of the market of beer, unpredictable introduction all a new and new illogical ban which locate allegedly fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative ban urged to reduce the level of abuse of alcohol has no special impact, nevertheless constantly there are all new initiatives.
Most painfully on producers of beer struck the ban imposed from this year to sell alcohol in booths.
"We lost at once 35 thousand consumers", - Isaak Sheps told.
Next year at brewers two forecasts.
The optimistic - about what told Sheps: sales of foamy drink will remain at former level.
The pessimistic - will fall to 2-3 percent.
To keep the profits, businessmen are compelled to go from the grades calculated on the mass consumer to the class "premium": beer will become less, but it will be more expensive.
Meanwhile, radical consequences from falling of sales with a small amount of alcohol it is not visible yet.
"On my supervision, the level of diseases of alcoholism remains approximately at the same level, - the narcologist Alexey Sotnikov reported.
However, the share of the patients using substitutes of a hard liquor, and also those who "sat down" on alcohol-containing tonics like "Jaguar" whereas "beer" alcoholism prevailed about ten years ago grew.
To what will give construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year authorities of the capital promise to equip more and more the transport and transfer knots (TTK).
Till 2020 it is planned to put into operation 255 TPU.
Than in practice the project is wrapped, our correspondent understood.
Few months ago the Smolensk subway of the Arbat and Pokrovsk line had a construction fence.
The inscription said that there is an arrangement of transport and transfer knot.
All this was very strange as near "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to change on it.
To reach the next trolleybus stop on the Garden ring, it is necessary to overcome about 130 meters, including land transition through Karmanitsky Lane.
Now at "Smolensk" almost everything is finished.
The flower stall disappeared, the stand for newspapers is dismantled, and asphalt before an entrance was replaced by a stone blocks.
Here and all transport knot.
Transport and transfer knots happen plane and capital, - explain in the press service of capital department of transport.
Capital TPU are not present so far.
And plane assume construction of parkings, a conclusion of the trade objects disturbing to the movement of passengers, creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
Actually, even not transport workers, and professional blagoustroitel from department of capital repairs of the city of Moscow are engaged in plane TPU.
The transport knot it is not obligatory a difficult design, - is explained by the director of Institute of transport economics and transport policy of Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes the roof over the head and boards notifying on a transport arrival time suffices.
Here, for example, at the Yasenevo subway opened quite full-fledged plane transfer knot recently.
Let without canopies, but with the intercepting parkings and boards specifying when the bus will come.
But in a pursuit of quantity officials write down in TPU everything that popadya.
In 2011 the city hall planned to construct for everything about all 151 knots, of them 59 with capital construction.
Now in plans till 2020 appear already 255 TPU.
From them one hundred and fifty is promised to hand over this year.
Though in the city there is a program of development of TPU, is not designated any qualitative criteria, - Alexander Morozov, the cochairman of public organization "City and Transport" states.
Report by amount of objects, but quality of change on each of them often worsens.
Criteria, according to the expert, has to be two: first - reduction of time of change, secondly - convenience.
First of all opportunity to replace a type of transport, without leaving under a rain.
In Moscow at arrangement of TPU sometimes leaves exactly on the contrary.
Striking example of the subway of "ENEA".
Earlier suburban buses from Yaroslavskoye Highway came to the square before a main entrance in the All-Russia Exhibition Centre.
Now their stops moved to the opposite side of the Resident of Yaroslavl on Kosmonavtov Street.
Farther from the subway, is much farther from a monorail, but is closer to houses.
Though inhabitants did not want bus station under windows at all and complained to all possible instances.
With capital TPU in Moscow somehow at once it was not set.
The first of them started being built at the Glider subway about five years ago.
The project was urged to become exemplary.
And really the sample of how the transfer knot assigned to investors turns into banal shopping center turned out.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy here not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parkings.
However, for the Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU room was not made essentially.
They as strangers were removed far away from the subway.
But places under trade remained more.
Only one clothes 32 shops, and in general are almost everything - from zoogoods to a motor show.
Well really, suddenly who from passengers of the bus needs to buy on the way the new car?
At us when build capital TPU, for some reason the shopping center always turns out.
Recently the situation reached the logical end when the part of parking was decided to be given for the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Glider" among the parking spaces marked on a floor there is a brisk trade.
The vegetables, spices, the Chinese jeans, the non-russian speech and security guards who are spitefully glancing at our photographer.
The transfer knot finally turned into a market.
The matter is that earlier the Glider subway had a market, but it was born.
And in prefecture of dealers regretted and let on the intercepting parking of transfer knot.
All the same because of high prices it is always empty there.
The most ridiculous that demolished the market to construct on its place... new plane TPU.
Such here castling.
At the Kaluga subway the approach distance from a subway lobby to the bus made 50 meters, - Alexander Morozov tells.
After construction of shopping center, allegedly TPU, distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on a bus, it is necessary to pass through all shopping center.
After 22 hours when it is closed, it is necessary to bypass it open-air.
However, designs on "Glider" and "Kaluga" will seem florets soon.
In the middle of September the urban planning and land commission of the city hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPU.
Four of them will be 25-storeyed, apart from two-three underground circles.
The main monster will grow up at the Tushino subway, in it there will be 418,7 thousand sq.m of the area.
The representatives of management of railway stations of the Russian Railway who are responsible for construction of TPU at the subway already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings shops, hotels and apartments will settle down.
Thus officials assure that many-tier parkings will borrow from a third to a half of the area.
Let's take for an example "national" garages.
Let's tell, garage on 258 parking places which was built on Mezhdunarodnaya Street recently, has the area of 8015 sq.m.
Means, the parking on 2,6 thousand cars at "Petrovsky and Razumovskaya" requires about 80 thousand of "squares".
It is less than a third of that large object which is going to be constructed there.
Let one-two floors will go to any platforms for buses.
There are at least 150 thousand sq.m of commercial real estate.
And it, for a minute, nearly two GUMA.
If capital TPU at stations and stations are built by railroad workers, other platforms will be mastered by metropolitenovets.
They too promised that there will be many "objects of a functional purpose", including hotels, offices and even sports halls.
By the way, in department of property of the city of Moscow told recently to journalists that develop the draft of the resolution according to which investors will be able to address for receiving a site for TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
Therefore supposedly that transport questions for the city - a priority.
Ideal TPU is, for example, Harvard stations in Boston or "Spadayna" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There trolleybuses and trams go down under the earth on the level of the subway and distance of approach from the subway car to the tram makes only 50 meters without exit to the street.
Round any excess trade.
But throws the Moscow officials into extremes.
Or we will build nothing, or otgrokhay 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell in price to $96 for barrel.

The trainer of "Vanguard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about preparation of the team for a match of the KHL regular championship against "Salavat", noted that residents of Omsk carried out the careful analysis of defeat from Magnitogorsk "Metallurgist".
The expert emphasized that "Vanguard" needs to pay special attention to game in defense.
We watched video of a match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurgist", - Chebaturkina quotes official the site "Vanguard".
- Let through many pucks, not really pleasant moment.
Passed because of the mistakes, because of non-performance of a game task.
We knew that the rival has performers.
Statistically they had five attacks straight off - three washers to us hammered.
Very good realization.
These mistakes were considered by preparation for today's game?
We with children carefully sort each match, we talk after game, we prepare for the new rival.
The main thing - that installation was carried out.
All saw the first period of a match against "Metallurgist".
The game task was performed, and the account was 2:0.
Missed the goal "in a locker room" - and started being mistaken in the third period.
Considering how hard there was a game, did not see sense in connection of defenders.
It is necessary to defend all team.
Now at "Vanguard" a long house series, matches go every other day - at team the fatigue collected?
All teams are in identical conditions.
The main thing now - realization of the moments and performance of a game task.
Hockey is an emotional game if you carry out installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
The profit of Bombardier decreases with falling of deliveries and number of orders for planes
The Bombardier corporation, the Canadian producer of planes and trains, reported on Thursday about reduction of net profit for 15 percent under the influence of the decreased number of orders and deliveries of planes in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway division.
The Bombardier company located in Montreal also did not publish any data on flight tests of its latest CSeries plane and did not provide new information on, whether ambitious plans for introduction of the plane to commercial operation by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft which took place about one and a half months ago it flew three more time that causes questions of, whether the stage of tests goes according to the schedule.
Results did not justify forecasts and led to falling of actions more than for 8 percent at Toronto Stock exchange.
Cameron Doyerksen, the analyst of National Bank Financial, lowered on Thursday the assessment with "above average market" to "average market" because of belief that growth of actions is limited in the next quarter or two.
"Though decrease in number of deliveries of aircrafts was in general predictable, we are certainly disappointed with indicators of profit of transport department" — Doyerksen in the review of stock market told.
We believe that Bombardier will secure new orders for CSeries in process of continuation of the program of flight tests.
Nevertheless, if in the next months it is not declared new orders, we assume that the market will begin to be skeptical about the program more.
The Bombardier company hopes that the family of the CSeries planes will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus now dominate.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time made flight in September after several months of a delay.
However meanwhile it is not enough firm orders for CSeries — 177 as potential buyers wait for results of flight tests to check statements of the company about fuel efficiency and potential profitability of the new liner.
In total now there are 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The chief executive officer Pierre Bodoin was sure that Bombardier will achieve the object in 300 firm orders by the time of when the first plane is brought into commercial operation.
On Thursday heads also assured analysts and mass media that the program moves ahead according to the plan.
"The test model of the plane did not remain on the earth more long, than it was expected" — Boduan during telephone conference told, having added that land tests and updatings of the software were planned for an idle time of the plane.
All producers plan tests differently.
We decided to carry out the first flight and to make a break on updatings, so we and arrived.
Will occur so during all program of flight tests.
The second of five test samples has to make flight in the next weeks and all others will soon follow it as the company reported.
And still analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start operation of the CSeries plane in 12 months after its first flight.
The Bombardier company declared that it estimates the term of commissioning and will provide new information in the following some months.
"This slow rate of flight tests - though, most likely, also corresponds to the internal schedule of Bombardier - supports our point of view that commissioning will be postponed for the first quarter 2015" — Doyerksen told.
In the third quarter which terminated on September 30 net income of Bombardier was reduced to $147 million, or 8 cents for an action, from $172 million, or 9 cents for an action, last year.
The corrected earning per share remained former — 9 cents.
The gross income was reduced slightly — from $4,2 to $4,1 billion.
Analysts expected profit of 10 cents on an action and the gross income of $4,56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth in the world in size the producer of planes reported that he put 45 aircrafts in a quarter that is less than an indicator for previous year — 57.
Total number of orders fell with 83 to 26 planes.
The portfolio of orders of aerospace department made $32,9 billion for September 30, without having changed since December 31.
"In aerospace area results answered our purpose, however the small number of the arriving orders and the general market conditions became an unpleasant factor" — Boduan told.
The gross income in the aerospace direction fell to 13 percent — to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest producer of trains, reported that the gross income in this sector grew almost by 11 percent — to $2,1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in transport division made $32,6 billion for September 30 that is a little higher than an indicator of December 31.
Problems with execution of several large contracts negatively affected the income of transport division.
The management declared that in the fourth quarter the new development plan will be submitted.
Shares of the company of Bombardier which also declared that the chief financial director of Google corporation Patrick Pichett will be included into board of directors, fell to 8,5 percent — to С$4,83 at the auction in the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world in size the commercial producer of planes and the closest competitor of Bombardier, reported on Thursday about reduction of the quarter income by 10 percent.

Two employees of YMCA are accused of sexual crimes even before charges against Johnathan Lord as the Royal commission knew
Two employees of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children before promotion of charges in 2011 against the employee of institution on care of children in Karingbakh of Johnathan Lord, reported to the Royal commission on sexual violence over children.
But in an opening statement of the commission it was said that it "never dealt with cases of sexual violence over children in the organization".
The chief executive officer Philipp Hare was asked about one case when the worker of YMCA was accused of the crimes connected with a child pornography and about other case when the instructor of the sports hall in YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned for sexual crimes against the children who were under its supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gale Ferness, to the lawyer giving help to the commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know about the second.
He recognized that YMCA in opening speech for the commission also allowed inaccuracy, claiming that "there were external checks of YMCA which recognized that YMCA is on safety of children in the forefront".
The presented commissions of the certificate say that YMCA was notified that it received the second since the end from four possible estimates by results of audit of the quality executed by Department of Education and communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare who entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, recognized that it and the subordinate management allowed a miss, having employed the Lord, and also could not provide a clear understanding with the personnel of the obligations concerning the message on violations of a security policy of children.
Earlier this year the Lord was condemned for sexual crimes against 12 boys within two years of his work in YMCA.
He was imprisoned at least for six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the assumption that corporate ethics of YMCA prevented employees to report about violations of the Lord in the sphere of safety of children.
Employees gave evidences that they observed violations, including that the Lord was alone with children, personally looked after them, put them to itself on knees, said that he loves one of them and allowed them to play the mobile phone.
Daniel Okvell which was under the direction of Lorda and asked to train it in protection of children because she was concerned by his behavior, testified that found Jackie Barnat, the guardianship manager over children of office of YMCA in Karingbakh which was the head Lorda, "very frightening and often remote".
The executive director told that he does not accept an explanation of employees that it was awkward to them to report about a situation to the higher heads.
More likely, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took away them from thought of need to report about him.
Mr. Hare told that he presented to council of YMCA of New South Wales the opinion that the lesson for the organization from "incident with Johnathan Lord" not "concerns providing information" from employees, and council agreed with it.
Mr. Hare declared that the decision to force employees to sign agreements on confidentiality soon after emergence of charges was made by the CEO of YMCA on guardianship over children Liam Wheatley.
He told that it was urged to prevent damage of proofs, but thus "were overzealous" and this decision badly realized.
YMCA of New South Wales was not the organization, safe for children, in operating time of Johnathan Lord in it during 2009-2011, the expert in problems of corruption of children professor Stephen Smolboun from Griffith University reported the commissions.
He told that there were "serious problems" at a set, selection, instructing, training of the personnel and control of it.
Hearings are postponed until December 20.
The screen version Guillaume Niclou of Denis Diderot's novel can brag of exclusive statement and historical details, but it also heavier is perceived, than would have to.
The movie which action happens in France of the 1760th years, tells gloomy story of Syuzanna, the young aristocrat sent to monastery by the family.
When she starts revolting, she tests extreme cruelty from hands of the sadist prior and becomes object of erotic imaginations for others.
The movie never falls to platitude or sensation — and in it all problem.
Because of the serious solemnity the narration risks to become test like a vlasyanitsa and for audience.

Ben Grinmen: Tenth anniversary of the New York comedy festival: New Yorker
It is possible to claim safely that New York — this birthplace of the stendap-comedy in America: nearly hundred years ago the variety actor Frank Fae working as the compere at Palace Theatre theater at the Broadway started telling jokes directly to public in a colloquial manner.
Fae's innovation was picked up over time by others, quite recently - the New York comedy festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hyorsh, the foundress of Carolines stendap-club, the festival celebrates this year the tenth anniversary, totaling more than sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"The majority of these headliners began in Carolines, and then achieved bigger success, reached the level when they are already too well-known to act in club" — told Hyorsh.
We created this festival as a way to continue with them work.
This year action "Stendap for heroes" — an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Maddison Skver Garden where there will be among other Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosbi includes Wanda Sykes, Cathie Griffin and Bill Mar's performances, and also.
With expansion of a festival also the world of the comedy extended.
Some comedians participating in a festival this year gained popularity in the nonconventional way, for example thanks to show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
The nickname of Krall gained fame thanks to a role in comedy series on little-known cable TV channel (deliberately obscene "League" on FXX on a fantasy soccer), and now keeps own the sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jannie Sleyt was a cast as in "Saturday evening on the air", and in "Parks and recreation areas" though most of all she is known on a series of virus rollers "Marseille - a cockleshell in boots".
Both Krall, and Sleyt, as well as other young comedians with original style (surreal pessimistic Anthony Dzheselnik, the crafty, focused on racial subject by Camau Bell) — is result of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
David Steynberg's interview to Larry David will become one of the most high points of a festival.
Steynberg began as the stendap-comedian, but then became the successful director on television and at cinema, and also the informal historian of the comedy.
With 2005 on 2007 it was the anchorman on TV Land under the name Sit Down Comedy with David Steynberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall hall in the center of Manhattan.
"This city — it is unconditional, the central element of all work of Larry" — Steynberg told.
He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks on any small street between two houses and thinks: "Here if I remain absolutely without money, perhaps, I will live here".
