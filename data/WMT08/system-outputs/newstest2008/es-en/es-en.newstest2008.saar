The European inflation slid into food
The registered, rapid inflation in the euro zone, one must first the surging growth of the price of foodstuffs.
The increase in prices in November has been over it expected in the 13 countries of the euro zone, registering - after the 2.6% of October - annual inflation of 3.1% - the Statistical Office of the Union based in Luxembourg.
The official forecasts only gave as likely a 3% - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike banks North American, British and Canadian, not cut the basic interest, under the pretext that the decrease, together with rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of the lay-off, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the rate of inflation below, but at least around two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is found in the catch 22: "It is necessary to negotiate" on inflation to subsequently does not have to intervene on this subject.
Inflation 3.3%, registered in Germany, beat the record of twelve; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 at 4.1%.
Inflation shot itself in the euro zone as a result of the galloping nutritional and energy.
The term of the wheat from increased by 88% and also the quotation of the soya reached its peak since 1973.
Equally, it was necessary to pay much more in 2007 for the vegetable oil and for the milk products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year in 52%, reaching already last month the oil almost 100 dollars a barrel.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will of 2.1% now to 2.5%, in exchange for the 2009 will diminish already to 1.9.
According to the analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the coming 3 or 4 months about 3%, but the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, it is expected that during the year 2008 the ECB reduce twice interest rates.
Gallup foresees a governmental crisis
After a long stagnation, by the beginning of December, the support of the alliance of democratic youngsters increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while the Gallup never before experienced such a low level - 13% - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the voters certain parties - due to the greater determination of the voters of the opposition - would mean a support of more than two thirds (71%) against the support of a fifth for the Socialists (20%).
According to the survey, the democratic forum and the alliance of Free Democrats not reach neither the necessary limit to have some parliamentary: its support in the whole of the population is two per cent.
Among the safe electors there is one percent more sympathetic on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the previous lower point - has never been so high, 41% the proportion of those who considered to be especially the economic situation in the country, while another 46% believes that the situation is bad enough.
Families, after the most encouraging expectations of the spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about the change in its own economic situation.
As for the next year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one-tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71% of the figure consulted, over any previous survey of the Gallup, thought that the President of government rather redeems evil that function well.
The 13% of the consulted trust or trust much Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor orbán has the support of the 38% of the consulted.
54% of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27% do not trust in the President of the democratic alliance of young people.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the experienced discontent with the person of the head of government without a change of government.
While after the riots in October of last year a 35% thought that it would be desirable to keep the power to the government and the head of government, today, this proportion is of only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) believe that the only solution is new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60% of respondents to the question of the participation and he replied that he would probably another 20% said that is likely to participate.
To comparative way, in "general elections to be celebrated this Sunday" would surely only 55 percent of the population and another 15% turnout. Believes likely based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt of the result of the referendum.
74% of the population would disapprove of the payment of the rights of studies, 79% of the service of medical consultations and 84% of the hospital attention.
If we observe these proportions between certain participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of the voters would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, payment by the medical consultations and of the hospital attention.
The most expensive is the auchan, Tesco has quintupled their prices
They supported the average increase the level of the prices of 16% the hypermarkets of gold the commercial triangle of, with the difference that this year the VAT has not increased.
It gazdaság Article
This year also increased by an average of 16% in the commercial triangle of gold the Christmas from the usual newspaper, but in all the supermarkets a growth was registered over the thousand huf.
As in December of last year had already "shot" prices in supermarkets in food, they experience a percentage drastic increase in comparison with the high point of departure.
But clearly it is frightening to consumers the fact that what last year were able to buy a price well below the nine thousand huf, presently they cannot do neither for ten thousand.
The basket of it in the supermarkets studied surpassed with a minimum of 91 the psychological limit of ten thousand huf.
And the basket of higher value was 10 573 huf.
(in the year 2003 this basket cost 6800 huf.)
The price of liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase of recorded fillet of Turkey, of the nut and the seed poppy.
The price of wheat flour and of the bread continued the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the auchan we have also found a kilo of bread for the price of 139 huf.
Competition does not reduce the price of the product to less than 200huf.
Equally it was surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with bottle of two liters cost less than 200 huf, so that this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 huf.
Yet, in the basket of it auchan was the most expensive, while the cheaper.
According to our calculations, with regard to the prices of Christmas of last year, quarter increased with 15, while Tesco and auchan with around 18% that appear in the basket of it.
Comparing the values of the most expensive of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, the difference has been a 12%, while the growth between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year has been a 21%.
The average growth was of 1480 huf.
Last year the average growth of prices was of 1206 huf, so that during the Christmas of last year in the prices felt the increase of VAT.
Precisely this process was which destroyed the trade, the supermarkets visibly were unable to take a decision on the margin of prices to apply for each product and to assess the impact of changing prices on consumption.
(if the merchant plans badly the speed of the circulation of a product, can lose an important benefit in the margin that conforms to the sales volume).
The increase in the price of the basket of it reached such extremes in consequence of the increase of VAT, that the most expensive more with 1720 huf to the value registered in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 huf.
This year such ends did not take place, since the highest price of now has been 1630 rather than last year and the cheapest also increased with 1284 huf.
Comparing the two seasons, a catastrophic growth registered in prices in less than 20 months, in the large supermarkets grew by more than 30% of the price to the consumer goods of first need.
(but this does not necessarily confirms the numbers of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods registered in the interval of 12 months a higher price by 30%.
Thus for example, besides the wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to the basket of, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, for in the price of this product that was already quite expensive last year in comparison to the basis, recorded, at worst barely 10% of price increase.
According to all the indices, the suppliers of feed have a stronger position than those of egg, being able to impose the drastic price even to the multinationals.
The large supermarkets do not complain in the commercial triangle of gold, talk constantly about positive results.
According to our quiet experiences, the majority of consumers of three visited shops, no longer care prices.
Of all the products they buy large numbers, taking for palettes the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, in the three stores great lines in front of the boxes because suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that in the interior of the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the secondary survey because the incomes remain under its plans and not only in the case of food, but also of the electrical appliances.
In many hospitals is saved with the disinfectants
This year registered in hospitals several thousands of infections produced in the first place by the illegal application of antibiotics.
The circumstances of hygiene in the hospitals, the overcrowding of the nets and overload the staff not facilitate the control of infection - it states the department of the national Center of.
In many hospitals is saved even with the disinfectants.
Not long ago a contagion has been diagnosed with the in the department of orthopedics of the hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident was the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was isolated.
The same sort of infection took place in this hospital at the beginning of the year.
To an injured a serious car accident they gave discharge the hospital and the same patient shortly after should return to the hospital as a result of the infection with the, and since then it has not been possible to make an important operation by the presence of the bacterium in their bodies.
Up to 10 December of this year registered in the national system cases of hospital infection produced by agents - said, Doctor - chief of department of the national Center of.
This means that in the hospitals for certain has registered this quantity of infections produced by agents, of the rest do not have information.
Nearly two-thirds of infection cases) (683 are due to the, is to say to the aureus, resistant to the meticilina-oxacilina.
A third of the human beings take in its nose of the bacterium staphylococcus aureus (Ltd) without causing any illness.
Infection produced by the SA (e.g.: inflammation of the throat, cutaneous infections, infections of) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treatment.
However, once it is applied exaggerated or unduly to antibiotics, bacteria which usually react well to antibiotics, are transformed into bacteria very resistant to antibiotics and contaminate quickly in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, for example infections of injuries or septicemia first to patients with temporary or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the Agency weakened, old or people of little weight.
In view of the hospital doctor - there is nothing in the infection of the special, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, the only is absent - said - where is not examined its presence.
Resistant to antibiotics
"these patients are isolated, the staff takes care of in rubber gloves and mask and antibiotics adequate to their treatment -" said.
The patients are examined previously to verify the presence of the in their bodies, but even so it can prevent infection in all cases.
It is fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of the in the majority of cases, but the current national hospital circumstances as not to prevent the formation and the infection with the pathogenic agents - it states.
As this infection takes place fundamentally in hospitals and homes of elderly, hospitals, should examine the patients and isolate immediately to the ill that they go in their bodies the the.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable sampling microbiological.
This fact is due also to the national health Pandora not finance these medical examinations.
So most cases go out to the public light when infections occur because of the visible in the patient - the department of the Center.
The European Union makes rigorous charges for the use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infection and pathological pictures.
It is necessary to get that therapy with antibiotic is directed, or, should be done to prevent microbiological examination is standing up to the drugs hospitals, but not always comply with this demand.
The sampling microbiological are still less frequent in the case of patients or walking in the basic assistance - affirmed.
It is saved with disinfectants
The scientific experiments have shown that in most cases the is of a patient to another through the medical team.
Therefore, they redeem a very important role the wash its hands of, the use of gloves of rubber and masks, but also in this sense experience considerable lack in hospitals.
The the is infected by means of transmission by drops and the direct contact between people, but in the national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the patient infected.
Moreover, the rooms of hospitals are often packed, which are often are very together, although for preventing epidemic, patients should be separated at least at a distance of metres.
Unfortunately it can experience also - added karolina - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation is saved with the disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In view, where comply the adequate preventive measures, less infections of this type are registered or can stop the transmission of the pathogenic agent.
Against the government Program
The treatment of the infection with the is an enormous expense for the national fund insurance, so in all countries will fight against it.
In Britain for example there is a government programme to prevent and reduce the cases of the.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data supplied, infection with the show tendency of decrease in England.
The European Centre for the prevention and control of diseases (ECDC) has among its priorities prevention of agents (among these the the) and of the hospital infections that due to these pathogenic agents.

Bulgaria, the real EU housing
Remarkable is the development of the Bulgarian property market - the attention of all Europe goes towards this Balkan country before little mentioned.
What thing, where in the market and those who buy cheaper of the EU, which is recommended quickly?
Analysis of the Bulgarian of d / Max.
The preferred target for the property acquisitions in Eastern Europe is without doubt Bulgaria, with its cheap flats of the ski runs and the of the beaches.
The regions of bansko, borovec, pamprovo and vitosa are the most preferred, while in the beaches albena, the "golden coast", the "Costa del Sol," the old sozopol and nesebar, but more and more people look for buildings also in the vicinity of kavarna and balchik.
According to the analysts of d / Max in Bulgaria, sooner or later, too, the central area of the country - as veliko tarnovo, gabrovo, Elena, triavna - will wake up the interest of the property developers and more and more people will buy buildings in the area of rus especially cheap.
In the same way may be attractive the capital spaces Sofia, trade and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is in the best way to become one of the most attractive paradise course of Europe, being able to be just an outstanding destiny for the other two stations, besides the summer and winter.
Therefore, the cautious investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the vicinity of bansko.
In view of the analysts, who buy properties in Bulgaria, also make an effort to change their lives and their way of living.
The majority of the clients are English, but also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly of Romania.
Similarly the Maltese and Cypriot developers are present and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the beaches of the Black Sea and in the paradise of ski.
The foreign customers can be classified into three groups - Georgi jankov, regional director of d / Max in Bulgaria.
Those who try to settle here buy new real estate or renewed for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad shape between 5 and 15 thousand euro, to be sure.
They require good communication and access, in addition to these matters the closeness of a major city, shops and generally of a local doctor.

Fodor and the six hundred Hungarians
As reported Minister of the environment and hydrology fodor the meetings at expert level will end on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening negotiations will continue at the level of ministers on the international climate regime post-2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries of the world deliberate on the road map of balí that has on the efforts after the emissions reduction period, established in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Today is performed lively discussions on the individual among the developing countries and the industrialized.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment does not want to negotiate on precise numbers, although tends to reach agreement that in comparison with the situation of 1990, until the year 2020 diminishes with 25 to 40% the emission of greenhouse gases responsible for the greenhouse effect.
Another great issue of the Conference is that if the industrialized countries, as well as reducing emissions, or are not ready to offer material and technological to the countries that need it.
A compromise was reached also on the helps to offer to the developing countries.
The background of support, foreseen in the Kyoto Protocol, will be guided by a board of management integrated by 16 members, probably within the global fund for the environment of the UN gef) - (writes "piac és profit."
The six hundred of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, the environment and hydrology fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its leading role in the global protection of the climate and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister said that the EU undertakes to reduce until 2020, with regard to the level of 1990 in 20% their emissions of gas, responsible for the greenhouse effect, regardless of whether or not it will sign the "agreement after 2012", and is ready to engage in decreasing even 30% if the other big developed regions of the world and the developing countries are also ready to assume commitments in accordance with its responsibility and its capacities.
Fodor noted that the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 committed themselves to fall in 5.2% within this then 15 EU Member States committed themselves in fulfilling 8% decrease.
The commitment of Hungary is decrease with 6% the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with regard to the period between 1985 and 87, that our country served - it indicates the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
The stakes in balí, since in two years it will be necessary to sign the international agreement of the long-term climate policy, because it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed for after 2012: in this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international system of emission reduction, whose need was noticed in its most recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association of the UN that climate change, which won the Nobel Peace Prize.
In doing so, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not be prevented an increase of any more of C of the average temperature of the earth, made according to the scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits in youtube
The units of the British army in a distributor of videos recordings publish on actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British air force () was the advantage that services of youtube: the special units displaced persons in Afghanistan since the March 2006 are charging videos on their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini mounted cameras on the helmets are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then they are sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
They are already 139 recordings coming from the soldiers of the air force that have been borne in this way to the Internet and its "channel" has already been seen by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence recorded in the spring 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Community of Nations (British Commonwealth Office) as the multinational forces in Iraq (mnfi) have their own channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with objectives of recruitment, but in view of the Ministry of Defence serve also to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of advertising practically no costs nothing compared to the conventional television spots of recruitment - the expert declared the BBC in defence Gordon - however, inevitably have some political message, because in a specific way justify the reason being to military action determined by the government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The army also concerned by the fact that, besides the edited and censured, in the distributor also keen videos appear, for example on the death of soldiers: in the official propaganda films "," a little hypocritical, the officers talk as most of losses, without presenting but the bloody part of the fighting.
Moreover, the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have borne the Internet because numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army alone ultimately is taking advantage of this opportunity.
The Americans use a form a little different for the recruitment of video games with the free shots called America 's army, in the middle of a situation that more or less real player can be put directly instead of soldiers.

On the other hand, if the law is approved, will meet the commissions on strike, and will decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda on Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only vote itself above the law of public health in the very entered the hours of night, or maybe near the midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, it will be necessary to include significant difficulties in transport: in the railways will be working indefinitely, in the morning can to stop a part of the public transportation of Budapest and more than half of the inter-city transport of buses of the volán.

Political capital: in the country increases the risk by the Hungarian guard
According to the division of risk analysis (risk analysing division) of the political capital the activity of the Hungarian guard, constituted in August of this year with the support of the movement for a better Hungary, from various points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In the "warning on risks" of the written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian guard the major political risk constitutes the fact that "with the worsening of the existing ethnic tensions between the population gypsy and not gypsy of Hungary, even in the short term ethnic clashes violent 'will be able to take place.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard is probably the provocation of an event of this character - the representative of the Institute of research.
They stated that all that is due to one of the main lacks the protagonists of the Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of the public life yielded the public debate of gypsy problem to the representatives of the political groups, radical extremists, who could base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians."
This aggravates the problem, makes the dialogue, strengthens the extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of the violent conflicts - estimates.
Moreover, according to the research institute, the activity of the national guard, by consequence of the great attention of the national and international average, "deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country.
We remember that: from the autumn of 2006 received ever greater publicity and boost the reorganization of the radical groups and the extreme right of Hungary and that since the summer 2007 have established in the country that numerous organizations themselves of "associations of national".
"The common feature of these groups is that they as civil organizations, while openly proclaim the training of its members to defence - even armed - (civil defence, proposes, defence of the public order), referring to the ineptitudes of the police, the army, i.e. the state - they add".
They stated: all that takes place in accordance with the method that tries to give him a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and political parties.
Then to emphasize the civilian and the form of partnership in the case of these associations does not only serve to prevent the legal problems of the legal inscription, but it is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of the vicinity relations.
"in recent months, in numerous States they referred to the Hungarian guard as a potential danger, while the political figures of certain countries, they want to justify its own policy with the creation of the Hungarian guard.
All this influences the political stability of the region "- they added.
According to the Institute of research, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that throughout the region were increased the political risks.
They wrote that the Hungarian guard functions in such a way that for example the Bulgarian, whose constitution was announced in the month of August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (unb) the extreme right.
The Constitution of the Bulgarian guard due to the massive disturbances of gypsies produced in one of the quarters of Sofia (krasna poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, the unb decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the objective of the organization is "national".
In its opinion, in the last 17 years there was "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the State remained impotent and indifferent to the facts - recalls the political capital.
They added: this initiative has caused an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As he wrote, suggests increasing the risk of the ethnic clashes which certain organizations gypsies of Bulgaria have announced that to resist, constitute its own guard.
As the operation of the Hungarian guard has so far shown similarities with the of the Bulgarian, it cannot be excluded that also the gypsies of Hungary will react to the threat in a similar way, organizing its own self - can be read in the warning about the risks of the political capital.
The Director of investigations of the political capital, Attila juhász to the question of the news agency stated: the analysis of risks is one of the activities of the Institute of investigations.
As he said, every year publish their analysis of risks and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing its warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law defines precisely the days to be written with red numbers in the calendar and has now become a widespread practice that surrounds the holidays - that next year there will be less - the working days.
Even in the EU or in North America are unitary.
The Hungarian laws do a difference between national holiday, festival of state and festive days.
The festive days fundamentally relate to religious holidays and historic events.
We celebrate the new also: the last day of the old, as the first day of the new is festive - the latter especially so that those can rest that happened the old.
During the whole year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national holiday on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and 23 October, commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 August we celebrate the foundation of the State, the 1st of May the celebration of the work, the 1st and 2nd of November we remember our family and friends dead.
Moreover, in our country holidays of two days the Easter, the Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the timetable, our state, national or religious seldom coincide with a weekend, so often bridge is done when before or after the holiday there is only one working day.
In exchange for the purposes like that, during Saturdays prior cannot stay away of work or of school.
Is the Minister of work that regulates in its specific decree when one must work exactly in exchange for the directly preceding or after the festival.
This legal norm of compliance is compulsory for all the owners and for their employees, as well as for employees and civil servants.
It is not obligatory in exchange for enterprises and institutions of services that, due to its function, work uninterruptedly even during the festive days.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the celebrations of the end of year: from 24 December virtually stops life in the country, since according to the experiences, most people "does bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with the middle or at weekends, so there will be fewer changes in the working days that this year.
First the agenda will be modified concerning the party of the work of that then, for four successive days, the workers can rest.
On Saturday, 26 April will be working day, so that in return the Friday of 2 may be festive day.
Another change relates to the festival of 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, it will be necessary to work instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the next year during the festival of order will be able to rest, since from 24 December will not work in almost no part, even though the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six deterrent to turn the life of your colleagues
E-mails that forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that happen without realizing: all of them are part of our daily folklore "on the job.

You take something that is not yours?
There is no more galling that when you want to take a document, a tool of office or your telephone and do not find them.

You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of
The car advances slowly in the usual jam in the morning.
It sounds a compass in the radio: electronic effective violin.
I rise volume.
To dispel the pace of music, and to the previous tones is added the low and then the voice of a female chorus as a true jewel intervenes.
The Channel reproduces the song of love of zagar.
The musical national life not us a lot with electronic pop of quality.
But now completely different this jam when you are listening to the new disc dezagar.
Appears. Some new and interesting songs of the digital national little by little are changing the image and although he is fashionable rock style garage, breaks guitars, the national pop has shown: there is news under the sun.
Balázs zságer began his career in the city of pécs, touched on the set of yonderboi until began its independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With its project (zagar) and their music, a mixture of jazz, of electronics and pop music, tried to succeed, when they asked it film (PL.
Ferenc török szezon).
The public knew the Assembly that at first acted alone in small when the magazine wan2 selected its first disk published in 2002 between fifty more important national discs, classifying zagar, together with yonderboi almost as the only national former of trends, capable of being sold also in western markets.
There is no doubt that zagar and a whole are fashionable, but nobody has asked if they carry or not gladly this label.
The Assembly reacted like should react: setting a new and even better disc.
The disk recently launched, entitled cannot walk fly instead can open up new paths for them, although the own title intends to establish the continuity with the initial in the city of pécs.
Since this title was one of the lines of the old assembly of Balázs zságer.
The reference is well above airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy of music, now appeared - according to the spirit and the tendency of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs presented the disk in millenáris György ligeti, singer currently engaged in Britain with the set the puzzle.
In the disk is included a real success of the channel that ultimately conveys wings of the morning at night popular music. This station carried to the ears of the listeners music of high flight of love, with six engraved Hungarian singers ($underground).
Then everything is in order (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs zságer.
Hvg.hu: after this new success the question arises: the one that you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select public?
Balázs zságer: the definition of select public means little for me.
In my view there are two types of caste light music; not mainstream and underground, no alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for selling, which makes commercial.
But also a pop song good can come from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners functions with this spirit, regardless of languages and national borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see any difference between the reception of your music on the part of the foreign and Hungarian public?
B. zs: abroad, above all to the west of us, the slight music has greater traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years the concerts, but also the old.
Pay far more attention to the changes in their around in the light music, because they consider it part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg: what role has the public in your work?
It matters of who they are, where they are and how many are the people who listen to your music?
B.zs: of course I am well to see that more and more people are present at our concerts.
But we have never composed music to the market.
Not compose music for any target, but for some reason.
The role of the public rather feels in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, lose their interest.
Hvg: to what extent do you intend to follow the example of yonderboi?
He works alone and did his career rather the West to us.
B.zs: we do not follow their way, even though at times they try to compare our music with him.
We rather work in equipment, we rely on the musical presence of other and leave that to unfold.
Initially it was inevitable that compare our work with the music of yonderboi, as many of us initiate our career in his group and hence we tackled another way.
Hvg: in the list of successes of mr2 wings of love is in the first place.
Many people have heard for the first time the name of zagar in relation to this song.
You opened conscientiously with this style towards a more extensive layer?
Zs.b.: we did not intend to compose great successes and sell our disk with these successes.
This song is something more than that.
We added at the end of the disk, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the disk and of the heaviest themes.
Hvg: how have you selected six singers?
Why exactly to them - which was the main reason?
B.zs: the idea was to create a chorus style.
Then came the idea of creating this chorus of 'good of the voice of our own musical national stage.
Thus created this chorus of six women - or seine, kutzora edina, judie jay, bori péterfy, enikõ hodosi [and] juci németh - that then was termed divas of underground.
Hvg.hu: composed exactly thus the song or the girls changed some things?
Zs.b.: this song existed long ago in instrumental version and when we already all the material of the disk, we think that something is still lacking.
The suitable attracted the edge.
Even that night I recorded the song that later the girls learned.
Virtually all came to the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous.
I remember myself, I very much then of course needed, but also the divas.
With my voice it had not worked with so much strength.
Hvg.hu: in the concert as in the disk seems as if the girls were in the background.
There is no '(except brief alone of Judy jay), have no proper role, sing all together and more strongly than music, so that not only the music accompanies his.
Also in the stage they are located in the fund.
Deliberately?
B.zs: they are in the fund simply by technical problems.
Instead consciously did not want to distribute 'roles.
The song is also about that, on which we forget our ego, which who where has come and where it goes, we leave so that those wings, the wings of love raise us.
Others have wanted to achieve that also feel that state of mind that we feel when this song was born.
Hvg.hu: to what more work?
Zs.b.: in the musical composition actually to none, rather, at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example dorian Gray's dilemma in that I am touching on a piano of concert or the rock 'n' roll goes to the girls, where for a long while not want to work and then, little by little was put in its place as in a puzzle.
Hvg: what is your song preferred in the new disk?
Zs.b.: this constantly with concerts and because I have already released "the disc."
Now is a fool, the escape from the earth and never the same.
A treacherous corridor risks of billions for their inferiority complex
A embezzler unfair.
So as to its former employee, Jerome kerviel giant, the French banker of Société Générale owner, also of the Bank of Czech trade.
He lost nearly five billion euros.
However, it seems rather than kerviel was a big player who wanted to compare his colleagues and, indeed, with good capacities.
Sensed long ago, unlike all large banks Czechs, the crisis in the American market of mortgages.
"has a fragile character" was allowed to be heard of their superiors, the same that sent to the police.
But what follows from the responses of kerviel according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, is that it was a man who late last year had a profit of more than 1,600 million euros because of their business.
Not only in Latin crisis
"everything we wanted to do was to make money for my bank" ensures in their responses.
Indeed, in summer, managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw it come at the beginning of the year.
In February they began to hear some news about the so-called priority mortgage offered clients of low incomes or for those who in the past had problems with the payments and that those clients would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not influence throughout the economy.
Kerviel did not believe and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year their profits surpassed the 1,600 million euros.
Already I "when my 500 million I could not as notify confesses", and adds that nothing has been left for it, at all.
During all the interrogation declared that had falsified records in such a way that it was not his discovery.
Even went so far as to cheat the leaders, even when the market began to be interested in their business.
The risk became benefit
It was afraid that came to discover?
Rather, it does not.
"I thought that had earned 1,600 million for the Bank and that from this simple fact, that would be happy."
Where took so many willpower to risk in this way?
In my position should work gradually.
It began to work in Société Générale in 2000, after studying in Lyons.
Its annual salary was handled among the 51 dollars.
Two years after it was assistant's assistant and in the year 2005 became's assistant with an annual salary of 90,000 dollars.
Still knew that it was never going to gain as much as others.
"in my first interview in 2005 already observed that looked at me with caution.
Because of my formation and also my personal and professional progress "described kerviel for researchers.
But at the time of my entry into the business came the great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this meant a starting mechanism, and wanted more.
If we leave you win,
"this is like a snowball" said the police.
But it is said that the leaders knew all this or that they.
While it won "money, closed eyes."
Only that, after the coup, arrived at the beginning of this year.
In one day lost billion euros.
After the weekend to half of January he wanted to any trace.
When Monday arrived at work, as it did in the Bank.
And two days later, the Bank announced that he had lost 5,000 million euros for their guilt.
And how they manage to locate?
Became a suspect from their holidays.
"I chose only four days for the last year.
The corridor which has no holidays is a corridor that does not want anybody to glance at his dossier "finished kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the possibility of obtaining 365 billion
The Ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine of the operational programmes that the Czech Republic can obtain 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion Crowns).
This is practically half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can get to Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Seven of operational programmes will come about some 125 billion Crowns for the regions.
The Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion Crowns programme of enterprise and innovation.
Most of the money will be destined to the transport, to 150 billion.
The agenda for transport is the largest of the operational programmes and represents until 22% of the resources that the Czech Republic can get to the bottom.
This money is the budget of the State fund for railway transport that next year will include the quantity of 90,800 billion Crowns.
The agenda of enterprise and innovation should serve to entrepreneurs and businesses to the provision of resources in innovation of business.
Companies should obtain financing for the acquisition of new technologies, for the industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the countries newly that less use them.
Twenty years penalty for the former President of Nicaragua, passed the Court
The Court of Appeals of Nicaragua decreed Thursday worth 20 years for the former President of the country, Alemán, who was condemned by the year 2003 by the embezzlement of 100 billion (almost 1,800 million crowns).
Despite this, a time later, was released from prison to house arrest in their estates not far from the Nicaraguan.
It is far from clear at this time, according to the Agency PA that, the then head of state American between 1197 and 2002, is again behind bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, ileana Pérez, will depend instead of the prison agents if they leave German to finish their punishment at home or if they do return to prison.
Four years ago, the Court constantly demonstrated as German money from the government to the account of a business in pánama.
This company was fictitious and account belonged, in fact, to their family and cercanost supporters.
Some of this money ended in the fund that German created to finance their campaign in the election of the year 2001.
So we approved the budget
This is.
The budget of state was approved.
Why is this budget special?
The first is dealt with by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget this year was already approved by the support of because it and set the Minister itself could not afford to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, approved calmly the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and departure from the budget, like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy but in it hides the rivalry of power between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the means of comunicacón and so they dedicate a special attention.
The political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The budgets of the State of the past governments of Social Democrats suffered three shortcomings that for this year 2008 is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of laws, called as compulsory expenditure of the leaders who are not only pensions but also the social benefits that last year were already approved before the elections by the "silent" coalition of and.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third is the deficit limit of public funding, as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
In spite of this, the greatest risk is not in the budget deficit of the State.
This is public and under control.
The time bomb, however, lies in the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many mayors to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money of the tax rates and loans, banks, often expressed, mindless obligations with which indebted disproportionately to its town councils.
In recent years managed to pay these debts through the sell-off of energy actions and of other networks of development that received from the state and privatization.
Currently do not have this resource.
If we bear only the official and verifiable facts, we found that:
Our economy, because a few years ago, passing through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, which boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for its government put order to finance the state.
However, instead of that the State kept borrow.
The rest of excluding some countries, such as Hungary, Pakistan, Albania or Egypt, saved much more reasonably that our Republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
Therefore are not necessary massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years were up with gigantic measurements.
And although they managed to remove some of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if brief does not change the retirement age and pension reform then really will be the end of any policy in this country and who govern, it will be just a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little we can say that the politicians who govern transform into civil servants, mechanical most of the money of taxes to retirement and the social benefits.
Therefore, the budget this year cannot be a revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenses of the expenses of the leaders.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion by the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the last government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We did not want that politicians who govern turn only in officials, so we must be patient and to grant this weak coalition government, who realizes that the state can only spend what is capable of obtaining tax rates, and the peace of mind for the preparation of other reforms laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced budget of the State.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks Swiss, British and Canadian decided to fight together against the crisis of the financial market.
In real monetary will be received more than 100 billion through tenders.
In these tenders the banks auction interest rates in which are capable of giving money.
For example, the American fed will send to bid 40 billion, and after another twenty-four billions will facilitate the banks in Europe and Swiss.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that banks of different States agree in this process coordinated to protect and to diminish the consequences of the financial crisis.
"this step must solve the biggest economic problem, that is, the continuous growth of the shortage of free capital that banks might give" wrote in his report to customers, Bernard baumohl company's economic outlook group.
"this coordinated action of the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65% to fifty percent" added in his report.
The banks have already spent 60 billion in outstanding credits, especially in the United States.
Economists wait still billions in losses.
"the central banks should have really fear of what are still expected when they decided to pass" said the chief economist of ABN AMRO, kieran Davies.
"seems to be that the situation is really badly" added.
The central banks are afraid that have the same problems of access to loans and that it will have to give more expensive their customers.
This would reduce consumption and sends to the American economy in recession with different impacts on the growth of the world.
The central banks so decided, that they did not manage to reduce the so-called tariff libor interbank London tariff, which is used for the loan of money on the market.
This means that the banks feared constantly to lend money even when the central banks of the USA, Canada and Great Britain reduced during the autumn their interest rates several times.
"will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates" said the Agency Reuters, Greg salvaggio of the business Tempus consulting.
Some economists not surprised that the step taken by the central banks contribute to light the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem is that the demise of the property market in America.
Klaus: the debates of the ecologists are incredible
The global climatic change affects above all to the developing countries.
President Václav Klaus was expressed again with regard to the issue of global warming.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the UN International Conference on climate change, in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book, not Green planet, commented that the debates of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mixture of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that is used.
"there the debates are hardly structured, are fireworks of words, substituting the solution to the current problems" Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book underlined that this subject is very important for it and that therefore is interested.
Also expressed his delight for discovering his book translated into German as "because often only I meet the caricature of my ideas".
Now the interested can be reported on their mixed views.
Klaus recalled that is not a climatologist but that has, in its opinion, sufficient supposed to write a book as this.
It is an ability to continue with, and judging a specialized dissertation, has experiences with statistics and is also economist.
At the time of the main closure its thought that the climate constantly and that its changes are normal, than about global warming, there is an agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, neither represent potential disasters and that attempts to influence the development of climate are useless, ineffective and unacceptable.
As well as man with the totalitarianism he considers unacceptable as imposing the opinions of others, it feels as a dangerous form of limiting the freedom of others.
To the questions of the present repeatedly told that it is not "against the reasonable defenders of the environment but against the environmental militants who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits".
On the same subject Klaus in Vienna spoke for two months in the institute Hayek.

The department appealed to the offices so that fines billion Crowns, at most.
According to the director of the Department of Transportation, Karel hanzelka, the fines billion Crowns threaten anybody.

According to hanzelka one is about 2.6 million more documents.

The group of criminals, according to the accusation, robbed tens of millions of crowns.
Excluding almost a score of men in this process the Court has already recognized guilty berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the case of berdych are still declaring of other processes, and some have not yet reached the causes.

An account by changing some 12 million children:
By changing some children in the home of maternity the lawyer of families affected, Igor veleba, wants the hospital of 12 million Crowns for redress more expenses of the judgment.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers at most 200 per father.
The legal representative of the hospital, dostál does not agree in principle with the proposal of veleba.
"We do not approve such a demand is too high," said after the meeting today.
So that we can get an idea of this ourselves, we need the report of the specialist that the counterpart sent to investigate.
We will find out whether it has a value.
We are supported in the opinion that will be hundreds of thousands to all highlighted dostál ".
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and the 200,000 Crowns for each one of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, the family of wanted, for every month that did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
He was served as the basis for negotiating the compensation of the report of the specialist, only that this devised in hospital in the Faculty of motol in Prague.
The parents of girls as specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered psychic impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The situation of stress was better supported by men though they fought with for change of girls.

Polívka lost the Kingdom of valaquia
Bolek polívka lost the row about the Kingdom of walachei.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first used the Kingdom of walachei but was created for many years by Tomás harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka was not presented today in sight orally.
According to his lawyer the cause probably has not ended and his client will recur.
"the lawsuit consists in that Mr. harabis and his team are some parasites popularity of bolek polívka" said after the process, the lawyer of polívka.
For him, before the Kingdom of walachei words, there comes to the whole world player and the image of the comical.
The same idea has also.
"We take after us some ten years of work.
Pursuit of money and invention of activities "said.
For him, the cause of the row is on the money.
"after years I have realized that the project is successful, and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites our work added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, the Kingdom of walachei was used first by polívka in its TV.
In 1993 it was crowned by the radoslav brzobohatý player.
Then it was not a question of facing towards the creation of a kingdom.
Some years later to harabiš happened to publish the passport of the Kingdom of walachei.
From that funny origin was a business and a lucrative business activity of which harabiš created after the Kingdom of walachei society.
In 1997, polívka agreed the use of its name and firm in the passports and even offered its owners discounts to the vistantes of his farm and assistants to their shows.
Who will sit in the throne?
The judge today also determined that harabiš only used a simple idea that polívka made public in the setting for its own benefit of business.
It is clear that "bolek polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of valaquia" said the judge.
Added however that, in the spirit of the project harabis and his team which followed it completely.
Today, the collaboration between the divided, continued until the year 2000 when harabis organized the official in vsetín.
Since that time began to be given conflicts between polívka and harabiš whose culmination came with the removal of the "King Boleslav I, chosen forever."
The main role in the realm, through harabiš derived in the singer, as Queen Mother.
In the year 2002, polívka presented an accusation against harabiš and their society that until now has been rejected by the Court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the competition for the throne with its Princesses, that is already preparing.
It should leave the new King.
It has not wanted to reveal yet more data or dates.
We do not have any hurry. "
It should be something like the way of King towards Moravia.
The King should be elected in a specific date.
Even the Lord polívka can be presented added.
Test Peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti overcome prejudices:
To tell the truth has never liked me too peugeotu 206.
Its characteristics of course never special, the quality of the gear box, move and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But there is now in the market, its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This called sw is a little more advanced and to me, because I only have to think best.
When I proved the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, complained, for example, in the space of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of minibus means in this respect, that I am not going to suffer before the two metres long.
Flying by the world
Step by the Interior one not to repeat it too.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here he would value the invention of design, although the car seems quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there remain the times in which we complained of short seats and supports.
It also unlike the 206 model, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space, and here can feel how the measures of the body have grown.
In the minibus disappears cited shortage of space in the head.
The trunk baggage
But the main thing in this vehicle is its trunk.
This I should value it as very accessible (thanks to the rear large door) and a storage well distributed.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber strap that mean an ideal solution.
Not bother, and can spread to the extent of holding objects.
But let's stay in the deposit.
According to the stage, in basic state has a capacity of 428 liters what in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the mouthpiece of the same type most sold in the Czech Republic, the Skoda combi.
If we compare the 207 sw with the new generation of the model of Mladá Boleslav, we find out that the Peugeot remains behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
Holiday abroad or placing the small car Nino its value is critical.
But if I have to comment on something positive so I must mention the flat that remains quite flat after bringing the backs of the second one.
120 horses in four courses
Our tested was equipped with an encedido of injection of four valves on a capacity of 1.6 L. and a force of 88 KW.
To tell the truth, and that is how it should look like a 1600 that underestimated the relative five doors.
It is silent, consumes little, and above all, has thrust.
If I compare it with the period of the Skoda then it seemed as if the exhaust pipe was blocked by a rag, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all the pockets.
We must, however, bear in mind that we have tested a vehicle elegantly equipped and with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with firing of injection of 1400 for 329.900 crowns, still can.
Our aggregations put it from 410.900 crowns, which is already too much.
The kind tested already reaches another crowns.
Only that still airbag in the heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic, rear windows automated...
That is, the car with all all, costs 531.900 crowns.
It is a lot, but has supplements the equipment in the fabia and will come to a quite similar number.
It now only remains to be decided by which of the two marks.
The Slovak students are not integrated in the English schools
In the English schools there help children of countries of Eastern Europe, and so the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a series of problems.
Even the British schools register those cases where conflicts between migrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of the children of Eastern Europe in the British schools is very well informed on the city of Kent where are starting to grow conflicts between the natives and the Slovak emigrants.
Discussions, estorsión and quarrels between students have already reached even one's parents.
Things have come so far that the police of chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was giving sticks to a student of ten years with a green.
In its defence said that she was insulting his son with insults tone of racist.
The police had also act after an attack of two minor girls against a Slovak emigrant.
The girls him with racist insults and threw.
"when we went home, a boy approached towards us the bus stop and started to spit to us.
When I told him that left it made the gesture send apples and pears, and later descended blue and showed us his bottom "described another unpleasant incident for the times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are on both sides.
One of the indigenous even appointed to the conflict with the emigrants of Eastern Europe and fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned previously, show us as the environment in the English schools begins to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for employment reasons.
Approximately some 30,000 Slovak students attend the English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the vistantes is really the island of freedom.
Anything that expect of their holidays can come comply, provided that choosing correctly.
Beaches and golden, great waves or a calm sea as a pond.
The palms and all including with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, frozen or various cocteles.
Kitesurfing, Golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean Sea can find all this and much more.
Only in an island is still and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the large Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Havana became store and port of burden of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and led to Europe.
And then came the American period.
The national hotel grew at the end of the Twenties.
It sent building one of the leaders of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since all they had of criminality in us (and therefore, prohibited) was welcome and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among its guests were, among others
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings arose, by wide avenues ran the cars that were a symbol of worship in 50 years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, near Havana, and in cojimar had its yacht.
In the walls of the bodeguita environmental left their firms the stars of the show business and politicians of all the Americas.
And today?
In the walls of the bodeguita habanense you can leave also its autograph.
In the bar of the expensive national hotel the cocktail wishes.
And those cars already of worship of the 1950s, until today continue working for Havana, because those lada has fallen and that were already some time ago have rusted among these humid and salty winds.
Even if Havana, especially the old is deteriorating dramatically, does not exist in the vicinity so many wonderful monuments as there.
Elsewhere in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels not only in Havana in dry, but also on the coast of the province of holguín and in small islands as key, key Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world, and that is highly valued by the lovers of rail.
The sugar cane is transported from the vast plantations to factories of sugar for narrow in steam engines or grids.
Their garages for dozens of years not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose model brothers in other parts of the world are only museums.
Where go?
The best-known place for the majority of the vistantes does not change.
And so there is no need to speak more of Havana dry.
Perhaps, only to remember that in the already mentioned exchequer of Hemingway that there is a museum for those that are lovers of writer, must not stop visiting.
The valley of vineyards is the most corner of Cuba in the island.
Exuberant vegetation bred in land rock.
Heaps, rock and rocks of high sheer the falls in the valley, and in his caves is fertile lands thanks to which are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where is cultivated, probably, the higher quality tobacco in Cuba.
Visiting some of the factories of pure can meet its end product.
Perhaps it seems to someone interesting that there rolled the Chilean part of the series, the major Zeman.
Trinity
That city of old ancestry was founded not long after the Spanish colonizing the island.
Slavery and the sugar brought fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the construction in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the French colonists arrived later, in four centuries has hardly changed.
Trinity, between the sea and the saw of escambray, is a place so isolated that in the 50 years of the last century was not road that joined with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped it to remain outside the rest.
Nothing new built and so, either, nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in trinity that a single afternoon, is worth knowing interesting places in the near surroundings as the beach of cove or the valley of sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of music, which encourages with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small city in the West end of Cuba, some see as the most beautiful of the island.
Surely this is already confirmed by the proper way.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantánamo should pass through discharges and mountains, as well as for a nature that hardly knows the action of man.
This place from Cuba has been recorded as world heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they do the best chocolate, in his church have the Cross of Columbus - in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where was the House and that there is now a hotel with the same name, can see the mountains and including the best known, the anvil.
Coffee, rum, pure, the main saw, the Bay of Pigs and of the island, the Tropicana night club, the boss of Cuba, the Virgin of charity of copper, the witchcraft, African religion that the descendants of those slaves, all this might fill many pages.
However, as was said, better to see it once.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient necessary equipment is what is influencing in the course of the mission in Afghanistan.

At the same time as the conflicts with the movimeinto Taliban, today, the eight States discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its Minister of Defence, Robert gates, encouraged to NATO forces to increased activity, Britain you go as priority to reinforce the authority of the Afghan Government and the distribution of development aid.
"The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
This is to make the population that alone can begin economic development and security "the issuing BBC Minister of Defence, give Browne.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to information from the American army is greater than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions grew in comparison with the last year by 27%, and in the province until a 60%.
The countries of NATO have in Afghanistan around 40,000 soldiers from that quarter are in the south of the territory.
However, in the United States, the allies have reached the same limit as for organization and equipment of units.
Exactly more helicopters, soldiers and experts train the Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and the way in which we will reach them" said gates.
In a sense seemed also spoke today the Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am pleased to know that is what we have in the land and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a nine-tenths of soldiers and equipment that we would need, and that is a little "said de Hoop to the Agency Reuters in closing the meeting of three days with the Japanese Government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the assistant countries in recent months the controversy as to whether all the allies do the maximum in Afghanistan.
By passive was criticized, for example.
"the Germans have a relative number of reserves in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimum violence and the demands of fight there are not as high as in our part, in the south and east of the country "gates said.
The sun, tabloid newspaper this week called the German soldiers.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to play while our boys fight" sun wrote in a material accompanied on of German soldiers playing the ping-pong.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops played a party of rugby in the southern part of Afghanistan.

In a similar way also sees the economist of next finance, it: "We could spend the trillion during the year 2009.
Exactament when that will depend on the next budget that we do not know.
If it was seen that the situation in the political arena changed and the politicians were capable of saving, then it might delay to the year 2010.
But I do not see such a change added.
The doubt grows

Likened today in front of a court to have given a name to a Teddy bear
The teacher British Court in Sudan to insult to Islam has been condemned Thursday afternoon by a court of jartúm to 15 days in prison and to the expulsion, indicated his lawyer.
The British were accused of having let students from 6 to 7 years give the name of Mahomet to a Teddy bear when every representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was long-suffering of a sentence lashes.
This British schoolteacher of age of 54 years according to the unity high school of jartúm in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday in their home and accused of attack Islam and of sedition, under Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code, as a result of several complaints from parents of pupils before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
History is in fact to the month of September, when this Professor asks its pupils, of 6 / 7 years old, choose a name for the Teddy bear the kind.
Eight names "flow from the mouth of children, as Hassan, Abdullah Mohammed", and the director of the school Robert boulos.
Finally, after a vote in kind, 20 children of every 23 have elegigo Mohamed as to name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the prophet Muslim, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have carried out a book to the class with the photo of the bear the following legend "my name is Mohamed."
The same bear it - not taking any label with this name, but the problem is simply to the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, needed to know well and that it would never have done something that can be offensive towards a religious faith, "I only have asked the children to vote for a name" according to him, this is only a mistake innocent ".
Opinion divided by numerous students of the schoolteacher that described as "very attentive to their students" and "that never speaks of religion in class"..
Let us remember that the name Mohamed is also the second name more given in Great Britain, is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often elegigo by Muslim families is a prophet Honor (often given the first child of a family).
But what are the rules which concern the use of this name?
For example to a toy?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.
Wednesday has not reached an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations to Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo have finished on Wednesday morning to Ford, in Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the Statute," the European mediator Wolfgang ischinger declared, at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was at stake "," its American counterpart, frank wisner, exhorted Belgrade and Pristina to respect its pledges in preserving peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.

End of the mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, that regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, Iran a last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the countryside populated to 90% of Albanians might become clearer when ischinger, wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander botsane-khartchenko will return their relationship to the Security Council of the United Nations, up to 10 December.
The discussions of Ford, next to Vienna, constituted the sixth session and last of negotiations since the troika has been responsible for a new mediation by the UN, last August.
Americans and Europeans that his mediation will be finished on 10 December.
The Russians, who already have blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, they insist on a pursuit of negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said botsane-khartchenko.
Unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, westerners consider that the independence under the supervision of the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina feels prepared to proclaim unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve for it.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
Unfortunately, "no agreement has been found," announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel of Ford where there were celebrated from Monday these "negotiations of the last opportunity".
Hashim Thaci, former Commander of the revolt of Kosovo and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of its regrets.
But added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to murders and deportations."
"domino effect"
The Serbian President Boris Tadic considerato in turn that a commitment was always feasible, recognizing the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the countryside.
Belgrade says "particularly fear a domino effect" in a region still weakened by wars of independence of the 1990.
"for Serbia, said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted so that every decision belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a right of veto.
"the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," had declared the Serbian Prime Minister Kostunica, Vojislav.
"these negotiations have lasted two years.
They must run as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
Journalists, Fatmir sedjiu had responded that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the Statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would do "in agreement with westerners."

Spectacular brake on the space station
It will have been needed more than seven hours of work in the space to the astronaut Scott parazynski and their colleagues of crew of the international space station (iss) to perform the spectacular repair of a solar panel rent and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that oversaw the records on account of its duration, of its removal of the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "bungled" by the astronauts to perform repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, then, that the astronauts had liberated from the shuttle the module harmony, a thick part responsible for receiving soon the European scientific laboratories and Japanese (see fit in).
This module is a type of platform of landing for the modules - laboratories.
But one must be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore move an electricity production module with solar panels that weighed 17.5 tons, already present in the iss - to put it in its final position.
After having displaced, the crew started the reorganization of the solar panels of module that have an importance of 76 metres.
And it is where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in more or less than a meter by a cable that was blocked.
The deployment has been stopped not to damage the panel more.
The astronauts, who had initially perform a way out of control of the shuttle discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel which was defective system of rotation, were forced to be dedicated to the board damaged.
And it is Scott parazynski who has been elected to go to twist at the end of the 30 metres long guided the arm of the shuttle added to that of the season to perform repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (walking of space NASA).
High, resistant, very skilful, has the very developed and the long arms.
To age 46, this training for medical has been entrusted to "produce" solar panel "wounded."
After being inspected precisely the damages, it cut cable and installed types of "boards" in the zone damaged.
The second had helped him "spacewalker" that had been kept near the air and interior, by other astronauts as Peggy whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool used, a minibastón hockey wrapped with insulator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundreds of volts, has been conceived and "bungled" by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once finished the operation, Scott parazynski waited so that the panel is completely opened before of their instruments and of returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts benefited from a rest noon before today, seven astronauts return from the shuttle discovery for a return to the land allotted on Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctioned in market
The action EADS is in clear lowering today on the Paris stock exchange, after the group of aeronautics and of defence have announced that tendá that spending between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euro to face the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21,96 euro at present on the Paris stock exchange.
The group has been obliged to revise its forecast of operational result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progression of the development of the engine of A400M, which sets the inaugural flight of the plane.
The cost to relieve the decision taken in the delivery of the military transport plane, announced in October, elevates "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus", announced the house mother of the European builder EADS.
Due to these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the result of exploitation (ebit) for 2007 during the presentation of its results quarterly next Thursday, adds without more coded accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimation of the new charges is coherent with the delay of six months.

Initially, the group predicted a first delivery of the A400M the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No wonder the Sunday, to the removal of the ballot box: the Russians are going to opt en masse for the party of President poutine, United Russia.
Confirming its quest for stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very limited.
In three days of the parliamentary elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin directs today voters a message televised on the public chains, already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
Does it as leader of the list for the party pro-Kremlin United Russia, whose victory is revealed overwhelming.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything receiving the foreign ambassadors, pleased with delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - its theme of predilection during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish honest, more transparent and more open, elections without incidents", added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign blemished by pressures.
The Communist leader guennadi ziouganov says that there is no "had never so dirty elections, even at the time of eltsin".
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the former world champion of check Garry Kasparov, condemned to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, the visits are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"the Russians kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus"
Behind these legislative elections without surprise two much more open questions are outlined:
Who will happen to poutine to the Presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 cause to know.
Elected in 2000 and elected again in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third consecutive mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful party United Russia that elegería government and President?
Whatever, to the legislative elections as to the presidential, power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"the Russians kept the mentality of the Homo sovieticus, not feel masters of their destiny", the sociologist estimates lev goudkov, Director of the Centre independent raising.
The historian Nikolaï kopossov, of the State University of St. Petersburg, further: civil society was postponed in this country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of Community delayed the formation of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 90s, "poutine restored the model of a state, perfectly accepted by the population as this new paternalism, has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic relief", Maria lipman estimates, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "resign for own willingness to the personal responsibility of those" briefly had proved after the outbreak of the USSR.
"why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all the social layers, including the world affairs.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the status quo: 65 (governors of each 85 leaders of Russian regions) direct local lists of United Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of that Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion Tamara tcherednitchenko, Professor of age of 54 years: "Why reflect?
Those that are to power are not too bad, why replace? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidential character, the Nazi files of bad arolsen, describing the fates of 17.5 million victims of the regime, are in free access.
The 47 million documents of files, stored on 27 km from shelves to bad arolsen (Hesse), were not so far to be consulted only in an end "humanitarian", i.e. individually and nominative, at the request of an old victim or of their rightful claimants.

The access of historians will do to bad arolsen searches "particularly on 'the prisonieros, the population of the camps and the state of health of the workers forced", explains challenge, the director of these files administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the supposed homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of the deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the orders of detention established by the Gestapo had been met after war in a practical end: to find the compatriots deported or submitted in the obligatory work and, possibly, to contribute a test of its internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in bad arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for some of the scientific community, access to bad arolsen has a limited interest.
There is nothing new "fundamentally wait of these documents," had declared in 2006 Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the centre of search on anti-Semitism in the Technische universität of Berlin.

There will be the end of the year in market? experts, divided by the crisis', '
To less than five weeks to dismiss the closing of the exercise, investors already rub the hands hoping that the traditional rally of the end of the year.
This year, however, the experts have not so clear that this is going to take place.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, the December in market is used to having a positive.
However, it does not agree to make forecasts based solely on statistics, even more because in the current context, the uncertainties lurk in markets, at least in the short term ".
Although not advocate that the market run in recent weeks of the year, these experts aim that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, ready to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the escape effect towards values of quality in the long sections as in the short".
So, believe that the market will have a rather side, not exempt from volatility "especially for not known the impact of the probable reduction of the types of the fed, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of encouragement of inflationary tensions."
Javier district, responsible for sales of bpi in Spain, coincides with that is not a good moment to dare to say that it is going to be rally.
"The thing is not for many joys", it ensures the expert.
The ibex has lost nearly 4% from the maximum marked on 8 November when the index closed in 15.945,7 points.
Still not all the experts have this vision that is.
John Solana observer, of intermoney, believes that the ibex 35 could close the year nearer the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pension schemes that are produced every year in these dates.
However, the expert points out that things will be somewhat different this year because it thinks that the advance of the second week of December, after the bridge of the Constitution.
The observer does not consider that the volatility is going to affect the trend of the market.
For its part, Federico olucha observer, of inversis bank, values that we are close to "technical levels and therefore we could see a repercussion of the rate that might be driven depending on the news that come from the USA as to the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
The analysts agree to choose the values which will be responsible for carrying the ibex towards new maximum levels.
Solana, of intermoney, states that "this year touches to the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio two big banks and some builders because when date, the electrical sector will be very expensive.
Meanwhile, Federico olucha, of inversis ensures that the Bank will come from the hand of the Bank and the industrial sector.
The construction companies will also be able to benefit from this rally, if it occurs.
"ACS carries several months recovering positions and we expect other builders as railroad and FCC should continue the same way", explains the expert.
The cyclical consumption will be a protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase of sales in the period of Christmas selling.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological also do so very well though in this case there is no great representation on the Spanish market.
Five times in seven year
In the last seven years, in just two occasions December has been a downward month.
The authentic end of year lived in 2003, exercise in which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the prick of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the ibex 35 recovered 28,17%, December registered a recovery of the 6,68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (at the moment raises 8,36% since January - and if it manages to have its rally of the end of the year.

The former Defence Minister José bond has accepted the offering of the Prime Minister and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the Spanish Socialist party by Toledo for the next general election and be President of Congress in the case of the Socialists gain the general elections.
So have announced in press conference the Secretary of organization of the PSOE, white, and the proper bond, after the meeting that has maintained this noon in the Federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former Minister "because it is important to include the better" in political life and bond "is among the best".
Moreover, has noted that yes it seems that the political will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over the Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace as President of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on 15 November its decision not to stand in the forthcoming general elections and to abandon his career in politics to engage in active fight against climate change in the university level.
The former Minister has recognized that the Prime Minister has not stopped insisting so that he returned to the forefront policy since abandoned two years ago.
Moreover, has indicated that, like the citizens know who will be the economic Vice-President if the PSOE wins elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside Congress, in a "act of transparency".

Similarly, it has had words of praise for its current President, Manuel Marín and his good "to" and has not wanted to see already occupying their position not to fall in which, has indicated, his adversaries might see as "dominance."
Climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subdues persecution both the disbelieving of their forecasts as to which they give priority to other social and political battles, is obliged to show a coherence of iron.
And more a leader of the movement that is as Prime Minister Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of the Islamic terrorism and even proposes "signing a new contract with the world".
That approach obliges to explain why the action or inaction, of his government have contributed decisively to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who are the responsible for the breach, which areas has been produced, and why its government, that of the contract with the planet, has not prevented.
Moreover, it requires to explain to the Spanish with the maximum clarity what are the measures that it is going to take to stop climate change.
What businesses will be affected, which habits citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been such explanations will not.
Precisely because it is a question of sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, they are unpopular.
Costly, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the cent of the petrol suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed so dangerous electorally Zapatero that has been quick to deny it.
That is to say, that is a matter of saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With stunning phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that Lord so useful for the electoral campaigns that or speech or charges, but neither requires adorns the tenderness and inspires.
Whenever it limits itself to be a merely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move by bicycle or freshen up with the range.

What I need safe?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible accidents, means an important expenditure that will depend on various factors such as age, gender, seniority of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of to this, among others.
Have the car is only the beginning.
Is that, to choose the adequate Auto insurance is even more difficult to choose the model of vehicle.
First there are to be clear about what we are talking about.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the policyholder.
This commitment materialize in a contract of insurance, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed to change that hold responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of accident.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established taking into account various factors such as age, gender, seniority of the card, the marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of that will be given to this, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that more likely to have an accident, greater quota to pay.
It is for that reason that both the biggest of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics reflect that have a lower rate of accident due to their prudence.
Likewise, making use of the inventories, the companies have come to the conclusion that the married people tend to have fewer accidents than the single drivers.
Given the use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and with that in the probability of having some kind of mishap.
By increasing the frequency increases the chances.
They are many variables that the insurers take into account when establishing the price of the premium.
It is so that the driver should study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best suits their profile.
We will expose here the most significant variables at the moment to choose one or other insurance, so that this, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years find different objections at the time of hiring an insurance at an affordable price, as are the limited experience in leadership and seniority of the card.
Although the ideal to be insured well is a sure, there are other economic options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for any risk with exemption, so that they obtain the coverage of an insurance to any risk but at a price more workable.
This sort of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the accident.
"the part of the amount of the catastrophe that contributes the client will in terms of the value of the premium will be higher the lower the amount," specifies Luis Noguera, chief in Spain of first mediator Europe, insurance online.
The other option is to a certain third extended, so that the client is assured the protection before damage caused to third parties, although not before the caused in its own car.
Moreover, it would be covered by theft, fire and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are less than 25 years tries to be careful and to prevent accidents as much as possible, since this will result in the bonus, being able to reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that has the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on this fee basis.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has had a good year can be allowed to increase the advantages, "clarifies walnut tree.
The Gaza Strip the past 25 years the drivers have easier to hire a safe, since the index of accident is reduced thanks to the experience accumulated.
For this reason, the best thing is to hire any risk with exemption.
"usually young people cannot make use of the experience acquired previously in using in an accident, and even in the conduct", it ensures the director of the European company in Spain, which adds that most accidents occur in the second year of conduct, once it is now the 'fear of the novice'.
However, if the client is married but still has no children is preferable to negotiate an insurance, provided their economic situation allows it, of course.
For its part, marriages with children are considered by the insurance companies and the public with lower rate of accident, for which the surcharges will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be one to all risk with exemption (being able to be this 300 Euros), or, when a high level of increase, one to third extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"they carry out a more relaxed and have a greater purchasing power to afford to undertake a number of major exemption", Louis Noguera sentence.
For the pensioners an insurance to any risk with exemption (being this of 150 euro), or one to third extended when it had a high level of increase.
It has to be said that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver to possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is fundamental to study adequate certain that we need more according to our personal situation.
The Celtic search in Milan a point that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic measured this Tuesday in San siro in search of the point that lacks to achieve their respective objectives in the closing of the pool of the 'champions', since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to declare its classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified in the fifth day his pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine other points, but it still needs to be assured that the shakhtar, with six, and that receives the benfica, which has four, do not move forward.
These two parties of the group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth every day, since the Milan has to dispute the world of clubs in Japan, where it the day 13 in semifinals in search of a seat for the end of 16.
So this group will be closed before the rest and the deadlock in the Giuseppe meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to leave to by a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning remain first and a better foot in eighth.
The set of Gordon strachan could serve even a defeat for qualify if the shakhtar does not win, but cannot be trusted because to equality of nine points the pass is for Ukraine, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but gained (2-0) in another direct sorrow.
Thus, the milanistas will try to it the night to the Scots, confident that getting on for the second time in restructured Champions League and of successive form, that they were defeated precisely in this round the last campaign with a goal in the extension of kaka () After 0-0 of departure.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the shakhtar for that only costs the triumph, in case it loses the Celtic, both to get in eighth to continue in the UEFA.
And the fact is that the benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the maximum European competition, could reach the third square with a victory, with what would play the UEFA.

New fears about the Russia-Ukraine gas
The dispute by increasing the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, increases the risk that affect the export of fuel to Western Europe on the part of Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union is directed through Ukraine, by which each close contact between both countries is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher rates of traffic.
A previous dispute last year reduced the supplies to the EU States.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian Government and the Russian State, owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount that should pay Ukraine by the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom declared that will become more to Ukraine, since this has promised to pay 50% extra in 2008 of gas coming from the adjacent Turkmenistan.
Commentators say that could be that Ukraine pay a 40% more for imports of Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important traffic for gas during the talks" the Minister of Economics Anatoly kinakh to Reuters news agency.
"changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of the rates of traffic [to Western Europe] via Ukraine".
The last great of gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev Gazprom, cut the supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which rose rapidly prices.
The Russian gas represents a quarter of the supply of the EU.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but most of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS "should test foreign workers"
The Scottish needs to control the records of criminal records of employees from outside Europe, a guard said.
The recommendation of the General Auditor Robert Black came after proved that a doctor abroad in connection with the attack on Glasgow airport, in June.
Black also showed its concern that the Scottish does not have exact idea of the number of foreign staff that counts.
However, his report indicated that other controls are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The General Auditor checked the number of foreign staff hired out of the European economic area, following the attacks in Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, a doctor's Iraqi hospital Royal Alexandra of Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting jeep in the doors of the airport terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who acted in the old bailey by video conference in October, accused in relation to the alleged offences with car bomb in Britain.
NHS hopes to carry out the controls of pre to the candidates, to ensure that they comply with the qualifications, experience and access to work in Britain.
Although the meeting of health of Scotland uses "disclosure Scotland" to carry out the controls of criminal records, the Agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information out of Britain.
The report of the General Auditor recommends, among other measures, that the meetings should include the guidance of the criminal records Bureau that helps the employers with the penal controls in many countries outside of Britain.
"although we find some of the searching with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review", the report says.
Black declares that the Scottish has a high level of compliance of their own employment policies, but reads: "our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that has the necessary information on the number of foreign staff of the NHS."
The President of the bma Scotland, Dr Peter Terry said he was "very unlikely that the" controls can identify potential employees of NHS that could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the controls work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made", explained.
The authorities of Scottish health declare that currently include 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, partly because the meetings have problems in identifying which are employees to include authorizations of indefinite residence.
Research also found that the procedures of verification established by the authorities of NHS in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were complying extensively.
This includes the permission, passport control of work and control of qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the politics and guide of pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
The Secretary of health, Nicola sturgeon, states: "It had a great interest that this work was carried out following the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the Scottish Government, together with the meetings of health, might consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of the guidelines of control for all the working groups - including the foreigners what anticipated to publish the next month.

Climate of Venus can give an idea of the future of the earth
Venus could have been once an appropriate place for life, declared scientists yesterday.
The data of a European spaceship in orbit showed the world more like an earth of what had previously been observed.
Venus is closest to the planet Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar, although Venus is slightly nearer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had similar conditions to which made a habitable planet Earth, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion by the solar radiation and the slowest solar rotation sent Venus at a very different kind of development.
Today, the world has no water, the temperature of the surface is sufficient to lead and it is eroded by winds and storms of rays.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus express, which has studied the planet for one year, offers a picture of how the land could develop catastrophic changes because of the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, physical department of the Oxford University and one of the leaders of the mission Venus express, states: "reason is being clarified the climate in Venus is so different from that of the land, when they are so similar planets.
"our new information makes possible to build a scenario in which Venus began as land, possibly with an inhabitable million years".

It still remains open
Mitt apologetic says that it is not dignified for the presidential candidates answer the questions of a monkey of snow.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidates for the Presidency eventually agree to maintain a debate in youtube, where ordinary voters record questions on video and they send them for their spread among the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the evening of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey that asked the Democrats about the climatic in the debate of the republican party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the State of the Republican Party facing elections next year.
It is not exactly how the producers of the CNN, to co-sponsor the debate, chose the videos of youtube to show the candidates for applicants.
But the first half an hour of debate, the longest dedicated to a single issue, focusing on immigration.
The issue is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of voters who raised the dial when they listened to them ideas: the transmitters noted peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
Exchanges of words more at night happened between rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. apologetic, which has been a leader in the crucial surveys of iowa and new Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin the reputation of apologetic since it was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
Attacked Mr. apologetic, accusing the former of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in their home.
Both answered aggressively when they asked if any candidate could support an "Amnesty" (allowing the illegal to normalize their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining the citizenry).
The smaller candidates as Duncan hunter, a Californian, and Tom tancredo, a Californian of red, managed to deal with the issue.
Neither is the word be nominated candidate, but both remain in the career perhaps because both alerted on the immigration issue before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, the candidates share views: increased vigilance on the borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the toxic toys of China and other concerns on the outside, helps the Republicans to forget, or to minimize, divisions between the liberals and conservatives Christians.
But the debate was transformed into uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
To Mr. guiliani asked why he had supported the arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. apologetic debated about whether the immersion in water should be considered a torture.
Someone asked if the candidates believed in every word of the Bible.
This led to Mr. Giuliani to encounter towards the position that, while the Bible was his book, it literally did not believe in the history of the jonás and the whale.
Another person asked Jesus would support the death penalty.
MIKE huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in the most recent survey of iowa, thanks to its Christian conservatism of long said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When it was pressured to respond if Jesus, would be for the laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent as to be a candidate in elections.
The race unusually remains open.
Mr. huckabee increases in iowa campaigns, coincidentally with fundraising of liberal Ron Paul, and his statements of the heated debate on Wednesday.
The two of them have gone out from the Fund, because both wings of the party did not reach agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined with the early party and convincingly with a winning message on the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pains
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but equally emerges
As the political scandals continue in England, this is particularly interesting.
They seem to have sold influences, nor is exhorbitantes accounts of hotels in Paris, or licks of fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the British Labour government party of more than 650,000 (£1.3 billion), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided to call an election, insulting stupidly the British intelligence declaring that opinion polls not influence in its decision, the hope was that would provide a strong government and efficient.
But instead, as vince calbe, the Liberal Democrat heads with increasing, because the feared Mr. Brown has passed to be Stalin to be Mr. bean.
The rescue of northern rock, a bank in problems, showed the weakness and poverty of trial in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put together, business groups, against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed a ducks administrative unimaginable.
A of distant generals initiated a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against the courts in military spending: be ministers of the armed forces, it is claimed, a part-time work.
They are now the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General and labour (previous accomplice) has already resigned.
All of this means that Mr. brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after that are unable to govern.
The people do not believe them as politicians, but usually suspend its incredulity when a new set assumes control.
Once it is clear that the Prime Minister cannot improve things, not to reduce a lot of time, this suspension is more: public officials are beginning to fail; the cabinet ministers exposed; the press seeks bad news; and the government is put on the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, the position of brown is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders cannot be defended arguing that is new.
Although he wanted to Tony Blair, was its upper lieutenant.
The problems of Northern rock and the authority registration tax, are linked to decisions that brown did as the Chancellor of the Treasury.
And even when it is not directly wrapped in the misfortunes of blairish -or "to" effective partners, research funding of political parties - the voters can assume that if it is.
However, the situation of Mr. Brown is not as bad as it sounds.
The is not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. bean, nobody has died, nor has it been defrauded directly.
And the remedy, painful though, is giving what the trends naturally of Mr. Brown has pledged always: a brutal and reliable government.
The new political scandal of the donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, comparing their donations with gifts of charity, says that he does not want public recognition for its benevolence.
Perhaps this is so, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against the anonymity for the great political taxpayers is clear and exists for a clear right: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those with power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know about the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and that this was not illegal, obviously face mendlesohn, chief fundraising that you asked him on the donations in October.
But brown so far is not implied: there is nothing suggests that he knew of these actions, although the bulk of the payments was made that he took control of the office in June.
So far the Prime Minister has made half of the work.
It has been fast in condemning its party to break the law, but is diluted in the taking of decisions by a family matter, a Commission of Inquiry on the subject, in good measure, by a judge, and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things that Mr. brown must do, as to find a permanent and independent for the Commission for standards in public life, since it has not had one for six months, and moreover must press for a genuine reform of the financing of parties.
This will require a great deal of labour cooperative with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation that has with unions bitter measures for a partisan as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way they can move to victory is in acting with an impeccable integrity and a sound competition.
Sharks cards
The crisis of mortgages subprioritizes is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there are blood on water, it is natural that some fins swim around.
Now that the American market of the House is in crisis, the predators have their eyes put on the market of the country of credit cards.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that losses of credit cards can come to 99 billion if the crisis of mortgages subprime infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection already seen.
There is an increase in both the charges of cards as in the rates of delinquency, that the proportion of the balances that have not been or that have more than 30 days delay respectively.
Hsbc announced last month that has taken 1.4 million office in their business of financing to the American consumer, partly because of the weakness of the borrowers of the cards.
However, it is too early to panic.
The slowness and crime are in low levels.
According to moody 's, an agency of qualification, the third quarter crime rate of 3,89% was almost a percentage point under the historical average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American law of failure of the people (2005) gave rise to a sharp decline in the requests of failure, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of slowness) would be growing again, or it can happen that the conditions for lenders were getting worse.
The industry also brings solid payment rates, showing how much of their debts pay consumers every month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis moroney of towergroup, a firm researcher, predicts that the volumes of emissions for the year 2007 will be around 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between subprime mortgages and the market of credit cards certainly exists: consumers like to charge the debts to credit cards now that the credit companies are expiring.
But the issuers of the credit card look more the flow of liquidity that the values assets, so that prices fall do not necessarily a change in the deserving capacity of the borrowers.
Even they can work to surpass the issuers.
The incentives for consumers continue paying off the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card rises in the list of priorities.
The issuers of cards can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that lenders of mortgage, changing interest rates or upsetting balances creditors.
That in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid of assets.
"We will not arouse a day and evaluate again all the loans," says Gary perlin, leader of capital finance one.
If a sudden infection of the subprime for credit cards is unlikely, the risks of a steady decline are much more realistic.
If prices are lower houses and a credit crunch push to America to the recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a more severe future.
One must continue watching those numbers.
British bankers convicted in Enron case
Three British bankers who went to court for his responsibility for fraud with the previous leader of the financial office of Enron, Andrew fastow, were convicted this Wednesday.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven allegations of fraud because they were colluded with fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to rich at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before the judge Ewing werlein jr of district U.S, each was sentenced as guilty of colución in fraud.
The three old executives of Greenwich natwest, a unit of the Scottish group plc in the Royal bank, became famous cause in Britain for extradition procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, its case slack marks the end of an investigation thrown after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to be alerted in 2002 fastow that was a goal of a governmental research on the collapse of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - "natwest three" - alleges that came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent plan with fastow and his previous upper assistant, Michael kopper.
Greenwich natwest had invested in a subsidiary of a society of Enron controlled by fastow, which was the creator of fraud in a myriad of Enron, who helped their spiral of fall into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the Bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew that he would up.
A company under the control of kopper bought the interest of bank of the subsidiary in $1 million dollars.
The bankers paid dollars to kopper by interests in this company.
According to the accusation, fastow represented falsely Enron, since the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich natwest by its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, fastow and others.
The bankers charged millions, while fastow, kopper and other received nearly 12.3 million, according to the charge.
In January 2004, fastow was sentenced by two charges of conspiracy guilty in the collapse of Enron.
The trio of British was arrested after three months.
Fastow is serving a sentence of 6 years in prison a federal Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million that needed to live in the United States while the judgment was celebrated.
Enron, one of the largest companies seven of the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of tricks in the accounting, would not be able to hide the debt of millions or make its businesses that fail seem successful.
The breakdown caused lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in securities market and more than two million in pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the former chief executive Jeffrey culprits were entrusted the years spent by their roles in the collapse of the company.
Skilling is serving a condemnation of over 24 years.
The sentence of lay for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when died of a heart attack last year.

Surgery "ducks" could be a cause of death in New Jersey
It was the day before in thanksgiving when Ronald livingston looked through the window of the "a bit healthier" and saw how an ambulance raised by white cod, two doors further down in avenue West Scott.
Suddenly, a car of the patrol of the police.
And after another.
Then I saw raising the ambulance "," said the Mr. livingston, restaurant's supervisory that day Wednesday.
"there was when I knew that someone had died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga stream, assistant of the director of the Department of the police of Newark.
Researchers are now trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure carried out by a plastic surgeon, which is still not identified by the police, but that work in the home of 212 of the AV. West Scott.
The authorities do not yet determine what caused the death of Mrs. stream, but they hope to test although the results will not be available until a few weeks; this will help resolve the mysterious death that has sorry to the top lines of the police of Newark.
The lady stream had been an assistant of the director of the police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and their voice was familiar to many in the department.
"it was loyal, working and tenacious says", Mr. McCarthy on stream in an interview telephone Wednesday.
"it was my guard".
She protected me ".
Mr. McCarthy said that stream was the wife of Jimmy stream, a former-official police Newark that works for the Commission for the control of alcoholic beverages, and that left two children of 14 and 11 years, and a neglected.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman of the prosecutor of the Union of the county, Theodore J. romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether the lady stream died because of a surgical procedure.

It is hoped will cut back the rates to raise the market
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic after the market expected that the Federal Reserve calmed the conditions of loan with cuts in interest rates, which increased with the calming comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States.
The markets were loosened in London, New York and across Europe Donald kohn, number two of President Ben bernanke reserve, declared that the Western should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets amidst growing samples of markets of credit, Mr. kohn said that the recent turmoil was "invested by the improvement in the market at the end of September and during October."
If the upward trend persist, would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and businesses, said kohn.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital markets in the United States and to subsequent courts of the interest rate, to stabilize the conditions of credit.
The observations also helped to defuse Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the economy of the United States, like the sales of houses that reached the lower record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil was accentuated by a notice of bear stearns, Investment Bank that will 650 jobs, amounting to 4% of its entire labour, in a global reduction of costs to compensate for losses of their investments in the priority of mortgages.
It is expected that only 20 of these positions are put to London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.

Britain takes the demands of owais Shah and ravi bopara
Here there are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should strike the No 6 by England in this weekend, owais Shah or ravi bopara?
And neither is less important set against the first test on Sri Lanka, who should decide?
The second question is relevant because graveney David, President of the choice that is on loan with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because the office of Hugh Morris, head of the United Kingdom, is beginning to fill offers to turn into national selector, and if not, in one part time.
The one that does not obtain the sixth place of BAT will be unfortunate, but life often is unjust and sport as well.
It is not easy to throw what does a man at the top of their profession, while another never goes beyond the low level, sometimes for lack of luck than by capacity.
Not only in the cricket the election is difficult, since judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time so that bopara rises?
It is just for Shah if he does?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, John or "," banerjee two brilliant executive young people with good grades and who know well the business, had to be promoted to the board: there is only place for one of them.
Who must say what a good level for a player of cricket, unless they give the occasion to sink or swim to the following chance?
The figures naturally have a major influence on decisions, but it also have opportunities.
Within a team, a player cricket must catch the eye of the captain at the same time to take a wicket and a batter to obtain opportunities to change the order if it wants to make an impact as a player one day.
But to catch the eye of the coaches is more complicated.
There were many that improved last season, for example, James Anderson plays, certainly in the first test even if Stephen harmison pleads for fit and bowls like wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class in 33 careers for each one to gain a place.
Chris tremlett took only 29 on average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The games of Shah or bopara at the stage of asgiriya can be only a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make the career of a man, or can make a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth played in each test and did well to the first, with 5 wickets 40 careers and useful, but was Paul collingwood, fighting to be established at the same time who came to become a major player, and despite noting a hundred double against Australia in Australia, can be still underestimated.
The likelihood is that graveney, Vaughan and moores, after a discussion more in the session of today in the stage of asgiriya, will continue its instincts of conservation and favor the greatest experience of Shah by the exhuberancia of the young.
There are arguments for both sides.
For Shah is his brilliant and valuable test of debut of principles of 88 in Mumbai, 32 hundred first-class against only 6 of bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent antedecentes against the spin Bowling.
But Shah did only ten careers in its two shifts in May against West Indies in the test in lords, his home as middlesex player, and that caused the immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed its place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken of his something to him that in Mumbai.
On the contrary, the team of Essex has joie de vivre swords in.
He is lit for anything in the field of cricket and its attitude was summarized as when overturned his vehicle in an exhibition for the sponsor of cars of England, Volkswagen.
Suffered wounds of minor importance and, presumably a shock, but the first thing that did was to take its Vodafone (client, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his team that looked to the distance, to say: "do with excitement saw that? '.
Bopara is the best player is, including its slippery pass to have effects on their plays that seem to satisfy, therefore bats with confidence and ability.
Choosing the right man is one thing, to choose the best moment, another.
Perhaps that is the true art of selection.
My inclination would give bopara its opportunity, which does not mean that Shah not stand out, as they suggest the leaves of tea, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to come to Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who remained without effective, without extensions of the visa and who hoped that the city to return to normal.
Some even had returned to fight against the militants who drove them out of their homes.
In the season of buses of mansour, even before the advent of 800 people from Damascus in an official convoy of government consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was full of refugees in Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria they killed many doctors in Baghdad, says," Sabah al-qubaisi doctor.
"I returned today by what I saw in the TV and what I have read in the newspapers, on what happened in Baghdad and which is now safe".
"say that the army of mahdi stopped killing people", declare, citing the Shi'ite militia of religious militant cleric moqtada al-sadr ordered, that its troops a momentary cessation.
Qassim to the atwani, Shiite 38 years and teacher in the area of amariyah, returned to his two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria since the State does not want the Iraqis working in their country.
Their Shiite in amariyah called for telephone to tell him that a force ally of United States helped to remove Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan was the leader of a Shiite tribe and who had been driven from their home in sleikh North of Baghdad, by an attack of grenades, after he urged the citizens to stand up against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had begun a militia anti in sleikh and that needed my support and that of my colleagues".
Therefore I have returned today "," declared sabaah obeidi, 62.
Many said to be swayed by the growing calm in the capital from the troops of United States groups of citizens concerned "," armed and working in cooperation with the soldiers of us to defend their local communities.
But many have declared by the refusal of visas and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis settled in recent years.
Salaam al-samarrai, of 51 years and father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles, that nouri, Prime Minister, asked to the Syrian Government to impose restrictions on visas for refugees to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe have fled the country because of the sectarian bands of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I cannot believe in a government that supports the criminals that to my home after I left."
Part of the reason for cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from the areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
The fear is that a sudden wave of refugees cause arise again the sectarian tensions and begins the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in the vocational training and even shines for international orientation of its high schools.
As in the country as a whole, the sarlandeses lack only an instructive.
"I explained yesterday by fiftieth time to not sarlandés that we are not franseses" - that was the motorcycle ironic on themselves of the smallest federal State for its cencuentenario.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have great role in the educational system of Sarre that in a study of the Institute of the German economy (iw) called "bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, the high schools for tradition have good relations with those countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was melted in 1948 by thefranseses.
Until now the students can finish their university career with two or three dipolmas.
In consequence, the procentaje foreign students is high, of 15, 6 by hundreds.
However, the number of students originating from the Sarre is higher than the average in the upper schools; many of them do not have a bacillerato.
"in the Sarre takes advantage of the system of the professional education", says plünnecke, experte of education sector in the Institute of the German economy (iw).
More than five young does its degree in the professional school; so it is that the Sarre is 7 points% above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety the range of possibilities for education is a very wide.
The offer by the double careers, in relation to the number of population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical vocational training and a growing demand, the number of science graduates of engineering lowered a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Sarre obliged the high schools to do more publicity for the specialities in engineering science.
"after the first study of steps, we carry out some reforms in the general education", States a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
So the Government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
So that the children start as soon as possible last year of the project called "kita-jahr, this has no price. Meanwhile, this model also imitate other federal.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether it has increased the performance of the students.
According to the report steps of the year 2003, the number of pupils backwards in school development desminuyó of 29 to 20%.
But, in general, the Sarre not improved much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, the students can calculate better.
For disappointment of the sarlandeses steps, the report does not compare knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field could achieve good results.
Despite the sarlandeses are not French, the language of the neighbours is an obligatory subject in the secondary schools.
Chávez changes the hour.
Póximamente in Venezuela there will be another time zone to the rest of the world.
On 9 December President Hugo Chávez leaves to modify the schedule in the South American country delaying the clock half an hour.
At present Chávez is remaining as a comical in Spain.
As has informed the Venezuelan Official Gazette, according to the new law, the time it will take at least four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a schedule that does not exist in any other country.
Among other things, as the enemy of the United States, justifies its desición saying that the United States imposed then the duty to the world to change a full hour.
Moreover, Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break-up of relations with his country Colombia because of action with the taking of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said no maintain any relation even with the head of state or with the Colombian Government until the Conservative Alvaro Uribe to continue being the President of Colombia.
"my dignity does not permit me to do, says", which is a constitutional reform where citizens in the country must decide on a Sunday referendúm.
With this reform would be able to expand enough its power in the country.
The right of the conflict was the desición taken by Uribe to withdraw the mandate of Chavez in negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in it the release of the hostages.
Sunday Chávez said criticizing the decision it took Uribe has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called cause sense in the country: "Why do not you?", is the sentence that have already unloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain which was upset by the continuous interrupcciones by populists left in the last Latin American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wage threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wage threatens the German employees despite strong juncture.
The experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Foundation, Hans böckler German employees should be provided in the year 2007 with a real lower than the previous year.
"the fault of that is the weak evolution of salaries, the increase of the value added tax and the tug of food prices and energy", informed the newspaper "Bild" Gustav Horn of the Institute of macroeconomics and investigation of the economic cycles.
Also the new burdens of the unemployment insurance can correspond to the employees.
The Finance Minister Peter setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to diminish the burden of unemployment insurance 3.3% from one year to another, it is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office of work does not have become again in an unpleasant situation, asking for loans and subsidies to the federal state, in the words of a party political German Social Democrat.
Tuesday made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the petroleum by-products sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, these are increasing 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the land.
Despite its atmosphere is not adequate for life, Venus is more akin to the planet Earth, something that until now had not been posed. Probe the European "Venus express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and maelstrom in the Poles, such that also appear in winter in the land.
Three decades ago researchers had the suspicion that could exist rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: discovered electromagnetic waves to the edge of the atmosphere. Cayen in Venus the rays of a height of 54 kilometres of a cloud and behind another, CRIS Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal "nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of urey-miller, the rays caused life on earth: the storms could have provoked reactions in the ocean that, for its part, been given the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus, no: if there were life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution, be Solomon explains the Carnegie institution of Washington.
Today, on the surface of Venus cannot be life: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than in the soil and in the surface temperatures of 500 ° C reign, so that it can be reached temperatures below zero.
Possibly, "Venus is a" diabolical "of the land, but remains a", Russell said.
The primary objective of the mission "Venus express" is to respond to the question of why Venus, similar to the land for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
And since the 1990s was not alone, special missions for research of this planet, the promotion of "venus-express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the investigation of Venus.
The final results of research that are to be presented in many articles of "nature", according to the opinion of researchers, underline not only the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
This desmuestra also that the "planets have more common characteristics with land which we had of course," reports that one.
Despite the already well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vortex formed by the clouds that turns faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of the flows of wind in the high terrestrial atmospheres of the Poles, as describes a team of researchers of Giuseppe piccioni of the Italian Institute of special and space physics.
The second planet of the solar system has the mass almost equal to the land and with its Equatorial diameter of 12 miles is almost as great.
This planet also called Star of dawn or evening star orbit around the sun almost 225 days.
But its period of rotation is slower: a day in Venus amounts to 243 days in the land.
Although Venus with its superficial temperatures of 460 degrees and with its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars does not resemble a lot to the land, scientists depart from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
In the two planets had piled up water that in the land remained in the oceans, but in Venus dissociated in the universe.
While in the land carbon dioxide had become stones of carbon, in Venus form the bulk of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the federal.
He criticized indirectly to the German Social Democrat Party for their attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Koehler Horst, the Federal President, worries about the reputation of Germany and therefore demand that the great coalition finished that fight for reception of the Dalai Lama.
"in this case we should not present us as a divided nation", said koehler to the newspaper "Handelsblatt."
At the same time koehler showed its understanding with regard to the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (party of the Union demócratacristiana) in September.
"although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are of absolute force for me," said koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in meteria of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach that received by carrying out a new policy on China.
"the Federal Chancellor did not take the distance of the traditional course of the One China policy.
China also knows, "said koehler.
Frank-walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had shown indirectly its displeasure by reception of the Dalai Lama and because of it was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its policy on competition unworkable.
The Dalai Lama's reception in the Federal caused great misunderstandings in the relations.
So the Chinese Government not only withdraw the invitation to peer steinbrueck (Social-Democratic Party), the Finance Minister in Germany, but also, according to news sources of the "Spiegel", froze the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, leader of the Chinese Government, required the Federal Chancellor, Angela Merkel recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming the position of China, Wen Jiabao said that China does not accept that European politicians to receive the religious leader of the Tibetans in its official position.
The actions and the words of Dalai Lama showed that is trying to divide the Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances as those that have occurred in France.
Battles with the police on the streets, shootings, burning cars: Wolfgang schaeuble warns that disturbances as was the case of France.
The Federal Minister requires that we do everything possible so that the social dissatisfaction in Germany is not transferred to the streets.
Barricades did, the ones shot with rifles police: after serious disturbances led by young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior matters, Wolfgang schaeuble (party of the Union demócratacristiana) fears similar tendencies in Germany.
"We have to concentrate also that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form".
"that we have to take seriously," said in the newspaper 'Neue Presse ", published in Hannover.
Not all the young unfold in constant change of social reality.
The federal state, the federal state and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, said schaeuble.
This refers not only to the integration of immigrants.
"of the Summit of integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving his first fruits."
It is still early to assume the end of the alarm.
At the same time schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs does not have the same problems and sociological as it happens in France.
The young carried out serious disturbances in the streets with the police to the north of Paris last evening.
In tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan kolat, the President of the Turkish community in Germany required greater efforts of the Federal Government to integration.
Kolat, in view of the riots in France, warns an effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, the actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under 25 years is situated above the average.
One must occupy that have more jobs, training.
Kolat underlines: "We have to give a perspective to young people".
The President of the Turkish community added that in Germany but in France "a great social control in families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, the majority of young people of foreign origin does not want to destroy what had built here their parents.
Kolat thinks: "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful".
There are "to offer young people the opportunity to receive more rapid a job or of vocational training."
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb villiers-him-bel elapsed peacefully.
Hundreds of police action, took part in a helicopter with lights flew over the territory.
The responsible authorities informed about three arrests, as well as into and burned cars.
Since the previous day a team of almost 1000 police officers is dealing with security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle alliot-marie, the Interior Minister, announced that the police will adopt rigorous measures until it is necessary.
On Monday night to Tuesday around 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in villiers-him-bel.
The riots continued the following night in tolouse.
The disturbance began by a traffic accident on Sunday, which killed two young.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of the young was not because of the police.
In the realm of Angela wolke.
The action very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition for the content arrived at its last point and that we should expect nothing else from it.
But in what country the Chancellor lives really?
After his despairing performance, indifferent and without much contained in the general debate of the Lower Chamber to say: it does not live in the country that should be governed by it.
As regards the reproach that was made by having devoted itself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected with a presumptuous phrase.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus to state that he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower House declared himself in a very clear way to all that this reproach was suitable.
It was possible to feel neither a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead, Angela wolke was presented in this way: a very high politics fleeing in foreign policy and remains there without achieving nothing in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: was praised a lot to itself by decisions made in Heiligendamm, but says nothing about how these goals must be made here in questions of climate.
In general, this way of being praised for two years, the leader of the Party of the Union has not been able to allow as much modesty.
Therefore it is involved in expressions so that a boost to the people.
And in this way damages its public image for the pragmatic view with which to resolve the problems without leaving for the trees.
But in the realm of Angela wolke the interior problems are aparencias of little value.
The poverty of the children and worries about the low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated to speak on that theme using subordinate clauses.
It is striking how many times is mistaken to speak when it comes to supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good phrase.
Starts to run "as if it had been in uncharted territory", when it was more specific information.
The section attacks.
The two favourites, rudy Giuliani and mitt apologetic, did a clash in a heated debate of presidential Republicans of youtube and must now fear only a candidate from the outside.
As a principle the tensions between candidates.
Mitt apologetic reproached his opponent rudy Giuliani for this having converted to New York in "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
This, in turn, responded with serious reproaches: "meant that its own House was a port for the illegal." Giuliani answers to ex--governador of massachustes saying that it was who used the illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates tend to attacks: so far as the group of Republicans does not have a clear, eight presidential take advantage of the debate on the CNN, above all to discredit their adversaries.
The small videos of 30 seconds, requested by usarios of Internet that were sent to youtube, do not have a lot of content.
"with this way of isolation we leave Hitler seizing power", that was the reproach of John McCain his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting that insisted on immediately withdraw the troops from Iraq.
Apologetic receives also many criticisms by the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when it refuses to acknowledge as torture "" a method of interrogation, to stop a person drowned simulate his death.
The reactions of the public in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida shows that in the meantime the most important themes of the campaign are different, not only the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strong when they praised the values and were denying the increase taxes.
So you can see better where the weaknesses of both bogeymen.
At that time I was wrong "," explains and asks the people and the public television for having been an advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, did not know what to say when they asked him what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.

According to information from the spokesman of the army a bomb exploded in one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of krautrock return.
The most famous German band of the seventies follows its activity: three members of "harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As revival became a copy of "live 1974" that was written in the best time of the band.
Already at those times very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to a food caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of itself its little, its cables and especially its buttons.
In the East is seated Dieter moebius that is 63 years and is dressed in a white shirt.
His left is Michael rother, who has his portable computer and the guitar.
Right, looking at the audience, is, 73 years of age, which is very busy with the board of controls.
Each contributes with its sounds, among them there even pace.
At times, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It seems that this does not bother to the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for excited of krautrock was the fact that the gang returned to make music.
What has to be revealed here is the following: the questions precisely have shown that the name of the band echoed in the minds of the people, but was not something special enough after 32 years the public the so much.
But why Germans also cannot applaud his alive legend of the 1970s?
Primarily because the ambiguity was always more valued in England and the United States which, in its own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a prize of music "ECHO" to the members of the band 2003 of Cologne for his work of life, in the room there could be seen the faces of the artists of German pop.
And when net hot chili peppers thanked the band the Düsseldorf und!, all opened up with astonishment.
Later Michael rother passed the time at home during the concerts of network hot chili peppers as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance recognition at home and abroad, they are only one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed two years and at those times not achieve a great effect on the public, however, obtained it later thanks to the other.
For some time already moebius and roedelius had done music with artist Conrad schnitzler and had a name, cluster, who promised much fame.
Initially in the cellar of Berliner schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, worked closely with a firm of music in duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For some time, rother had a small job in kraftwerk and worked in the band of guitarist! it managed to improve the reputation of this German band that in those times was too radical.
In 1973 rother followed the musicians of cluster in exile to forst in weserbergland.
There, in alten weserdorf, that is in ruins the sixteenth century, were living as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than I, where roedelius could complain of its position.
It was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
They say, a day appeared a song association of edge of singing in the rubbish, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name.
The first albúm was called "musik von harmonia" and "of the second lux".
Despite the musical calm and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as the artist was not alone to be known to itself.
The CD "live 1974" was recorded during a concert in griessem. Someone recalls that on this recording almost 50 people took part.
Then rother expressed his desire to promote harmonia and make once in a while.
For roedelius and moebius this demand is against the customs.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother finished put on issues and assured its existence with albums as "flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has had more success than it did.
In direct the recording of the albúm in griessmer, that there are to be thanked.
Its business of music was put as it puts to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve as music alive.
As the work of roedelius, also the gang! again it was discovered.
The presentation as band takes place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public of the festival.
There is Julian cope, English, the old and the author of the manual "krautrock sampler".
There is also present Dr. motte, the inventor of loveparade.
In this way, all influences krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a super, since he was empty.
The phrase of Brian eno coupled with the full special music the room: "this music is the only true music, to her him partenece the fúturo".
Where there are photos appears with producers in farm.
The history of the development of the legend appears in the projections of photos in black and white, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the fund three veterans that began to improvise again.
Do nothing more than to set the microphones at the European Council and the battery to be able to produce some extraordinary tones with the help of the expected effects that had built with their own hands.
At present the electronic music is as well as it had to be.
Three people who study in the technique.
But that does not change anything.
Under the direction of barbaric, in a musical atmosphere is, is whispered and in a good moment of emphasis is sung "".
Krautrock already was always a term of British origin.
But it was never rock.
Is not the origin of the kind in the blues, but in the music (can), in technologies (kraftwerk) or fleeing the artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever shouts "68 here" is right now, but also preserves the calm.
In the stage reflects very well on what is already clear.
Where begins and ends up where music?
That can break the nerves to one or give fast moments of luck.
Richard gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "the party" and "moerderischer Frieden" engaged again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two had no conviction.
Or the concepts are set a lot in actions and tirotes or both films are thrilling exciting.
Richard gere with its "the party" cannot help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, remain hidden in the mountain of the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark countryside during the war in Bosnia, actor Richard gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight to the man of the eighties, because nobody wanted to see after his pleasant roles and unimportant in films to women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard gere is the most important argument to see perhaps the film "the hunting when a hunter becomes what it" (why today the titles of the films have to be so long and absurd?).
The film has a wonderful presentation to the view: in the fund, its role in the reporter war is the presentation of what could make Richard gere, if the industry and the fate of the cinema had not been so with him; he was a man whose better times of life already passed, that as a monument to the ruin of its decline kept until now most of his charm.
"The party", despite this victory, together with "moerderischer Frieden" that is the German production and will also be presented this week, are to be only a series of films with success on the war in the Balkans.
One can relate the film "moerderischer Frieden" briefly: these are two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt) who want to save a Serbia of the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very fast and that they also carries with it.
The meaning of the film is lost by the actions and the firing, although we are glad that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "quality charges 11" without freeway, but in situations of war.
In the case of "the party" can investigate, because in reality there has never been a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another point, with another director and with another author of script (Richard shepard in two charges), history on the American reporters in the war that go to detect a Serbian war criminal called "Fox", probably could be a new "now".
So the stories are remarkably similar: the small equipment leaves twice to the mountain to carry out something that cannot do the army and is a journey in madness.
A reason of the failure of "the party" is the beginning when we present to Simon, he did not allow him to be simply a cynic with heart.
No, the script foresees also a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that are going to kill then.
Then "the party" is very far from reality, particularly in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive rapidly achieve what could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the heads of the world's office, which was to capture the war criminal and to leave the Bosnians for for a just form.
It is so badly, who want to appeal to the International Court in The Hague based on the against cinematic logic.
However, the intention of the film is, in fact, one humanprofondamente.
The movie wants to condemn the fact that and they be even free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really worried to pursue them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this peoma it is a mask of a demon Asia: "in the wrinkles of their front I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be bad".
In films as "the party" there are also these demons but they demonstrate that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only about the kind of films of war in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published all films on Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It is possible to add also that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
It is almost always a rule: when a star gets for a region of crisis or for the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia arguette, "on the other side of all borders with Angelina jolie diamond" or "with Leonardo dicaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood a good film on the Holocaust taking as an example the film "the list of Schindler".
Already some films need more time; as the classical works on the war in Vietnam "the", "now" or "full metal" in their times were not celebrated by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Today perhaps know too much on world conflicts, and therefore in our time every slaughter (massenmord) comes directly presented in two televisions at home.
And that is because the script authors have no objection whatsoever - which is necessary for power) in telling stories good.
"to be or not to be" or "the great dictator" proved in the end so good, because lubitsch and Chaplin knew that it was not as bad in reality the Nazi regime.
Perhaps it should not be a good person to make a film.
Perhaps there is to be as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with its sarcastic and distant from an artist.
When they asked him on the parallels between its historical novel "dictionary of lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, replied: "that is due only to some things never change".
The big cities will always be in danger, men are always going to be murdered cruelly and always reign the war in Yugoslavia.
Von receives the negative criticism as answer on the Olympic Games.
The Mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms of politics and economics because he did not request the Summer Olympic Games.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the section of aquatic sports.
But beust reminds us that there are to be realistic when considering the possibilities.
Hans-joerg schmidt-trenz, Director General of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, declared on Wednesday this resignation as "not good for the economic site".
Lately no another project in the great city promoted as much motivation as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"without this objective would not be able to maintain the political momentum sport at the same level."
Schmidt-trenz required to the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time".
Wednesday the mayor smells von supported his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Olympic Games of summer were not carried out until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympic Games, but decides the German Federation of Olympic sports, says von in the Welt online.
He sent to the decision of the Federation of sport (sportbund) to be expected at the beginning of December, on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of the winter of 2028.
This means "preference for us in this period of time, we thought that until now have until 2028, from the point of view realistic will not have any opportunity".
Despite everything, this dream did not finish forever, said von.
The Federation of sport beer (hsb) regrets the statements of von beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to request the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave to remove the opportunity, if at this moment the plans are ruined," said the Wednesday Günter ploß, the director.
A renunciation of the request is contradictory to the declaration of the leader of the Senate that did in a reception because of the general meeting of the public's German sport of the high schools (adh).
There von appointed the request of Hamburg for universiadas of 2015 as a "no" substitution of the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of sport of the high schools named Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The fraction of the German Social Democrat Party (spd-bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate not to take advantage of the time so valuable to build houses in Hamburg.
For many years the Senate "holding with the development of the small quarter of grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or building houses", affirmed Carola veit and Jan quast, the representatives of the German Social Democrat Party (SDP).
While the SPD always demanding an integrated planning of olimpia for the small grasbrook and then the use of houses built, the CDU underlined the importance of entertainment.
At that time, the request of Hamburg to the Olympic Games in the summer of 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It is not the boxes of wood.
Who relates the terms Sweden and box of wood, thinks about Ikea, but does not think about Andy warhol.
Or is it?
At present the boxes of wood produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on the list of works of warhol.
Most of the 1990s shine-pit of "type" of this list is false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "expressen" put the question on the authenticity of shine-pits of 1968 of Andy warhol, the museum moderna of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached conclusions: the six "brillo-boxes, that" the museum hultén gave to the museum moderna, are false, and almost a hundred of the other "type of Stockholm", which are in circulation in the market of the international art, also work.
The prehistory is too complicated with a confused relationship between the artistic productions and patrocionadas.
In 1964 warhol created in New York their first "shine-pits", painted the boxes, blue boxes of red and white, with the same shows that had soap powder flakes "shine."
According to warhol, in the exposure of their works of 1968 in the museum moderna were exposed hundreds of cardboard. These did not warhol (because of the expenses), but they were brought directly factory cardboard of "shine."
It was not a question of works of art, but of copies (which was only objects) exposed.
In the same year, 1968, warhol allowed to produce in Sweden timber, but it was not set out in the modern museet museum.
Witnesses of those times speak now that almost fifteen boxes, that in that time entered the art history and of the auction as original of the "shine-pits" "type of Stockholm" authorized Andy warhol.
Auctions in some of them were bought by more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem is that after the famous museum director moderna did false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the boxes of wood that warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time had already died since 3.
Lars byström, the leader of the Conservatives in the museum moderna investigated, six brillo-boxes property of Museum and three of the Swedish private property that were made in 1968 in Stockholm. First be printed and polished its silver and then the painted to the with the.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without printing directly the tight. Also it is not a question of the oil painting, but of the paint.
"these boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be eliminated from the official list of shine-pits of Andy warhol says", Lars nittve, the director of the museum moderna and add that if the Commission of authentication "Andy warhol art" in New York will not come to any conclusion, the museum moderna classify these six boxes as the copies / objects of exposure. "
Already in July the Commission of authentication announced formally that accepts these "serious accusations" in which they are boxes of dust flakes.
But since that time there all remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines have consistently rebel soldiers who had taken refuge in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of the macapagal President Gloria Arroyo.
The Leader Antonio trillanes, who reproaches the President, corruption and electoral fraud, said a reporter who could not respond to spill blood.
The soldiers faithful to the government had assaulted the hotel using tear gas.
Almost two hundred soldiers were taking refuge for a few hours in the building.
Almost half of them, including trillanes, had Thursday trial for having tried a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He used the negotiations, suddenly to be able to settle with some 30 supporters.
Clearly the military police officers who had to watch it had gone to their ranks and followed its riot.
They entered the hotel Peninsula "and" demanded the fall of the macapagal President Gloria Arroyo.
