Inflation, in Europe, slipped into the food
The accelerated inflation, measured in the euro zone, is due mainly to the rapid increase in the price of food.
In November, the rise in prices, in 13 countries of the euro zone, has been more important in relation to the forecasts, after a rate of inflation of 2.6% in October, an annual inflation of 3.1% has been recorded, pointed out the office of the statistics of the European Community located in Luxembourg.
The official predictions have indicated that 3%, announced Bloomberg.
In contrast to the American, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lower the rate of Director in saying that the reduction of the intérets, with the growth of the prices of the premieres and the fall in the rate of unemployment, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would wish to maintain the rate of inflation below but close to two percent.
According to one analyst, it is wrestling 22 for the ECB: "It is necessary to dissuade" inflation in order not to have any more has to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the rate of inflation of 3.3% is a record in the course of these twelve years and in Spain, it went up has 4.1.
Inflation in the euro zone has taken off because of the rapid rise in the price of food and energy.
The dimensions of the terms of the cereals market has increased by 88% and the course of soya has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also considerably in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil has risen 52% and, last month, a barrel of oil coutait almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, in 2008, the rate of inflation will cross, this year, 2.5% but, in 2009, it will go down has 1.9.
According to the analysis, the rate of inflation over 12 months remains around 3%, however, the 3 to 4 months old, the annual average rate will be 2.1%.
In the same time, they expect this that the ECB reduces the director twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (alliance of young democrats) has increased significantly at the beginning of December, so since 2002, it currently has the greatest number of people, while Gallup survey) (Institute has never seen before such a weak Socialist support, namely 13%.
For the voters, the difference is, because of the greatest determination of the voters of the opposition, the support of more than two thirds (71%) against the support of a cinquieme (20%) for the mszp (the Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to opinion poll, MDF (forum of the Hungarian Democrats) and the szdsz (alliance of free democrats) are below the threshold of Members of Parliament: their support is two percent in the whole population.
On the voters some to go to vote, the number of supporters of the two parties has increased of 1%.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in relation to the previous point the lowest, the proportion of those who have judged that the economic situation of the country was particularly serious has never been so high, it amounts has 41% and according to 46% supplementary the situation is serious enough.
After the most optimistic of spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is a worsening and only a dixieme envisages an improvement of the situation.
In December last year, 71% of the people polled, namely a majority ever seen during the previous surveys of Gallup, judged that the Prime Minister did his job rather badly as well.
13% polling trust or a lot of trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38% support Viktor orbán.
54% do not trust at all with the Prime Minister and 27% to the President of the Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of the company thinking that the dissatisfaction with respect to the Prime Minister, can be addressed without a change of government.
Whereas after the riots of last October, 35% polling hoped that the government and Prime Minister remain in office, currently this rate is only 20%; the simple majority (33%) estimates that the behaviour of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
The question regarding the intention to vote, 60 percent polling reply that they would certainly vote and the 20% supplementary say that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for an "legislative elections to organize next Sunday," only 55 percent polling would certainly and 15% supplementary would probably. In accordance with the actual intentions, the result of the referendum does not make any doubt.
74% of people would say no to the registration fees in higher education, 79% would say, not at the expense of consultation and 84% would say no to the subsistence expenses hospital.
When we look at only the proportions among the people who have expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89% of the voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, expenses of consultation and subsistence expenses hospital.
Auchan is more expensive, Tesco has increased its price of almost twenty percent
The supermarkets established in the commercial of budaörs supported the average increase in the prices of 16% of the year has the difference that this year the rate of VAT has not increased.
Item of napi gazdaság (daily economy)
This year, in the commercial of budaörs basket of Christmas, the usual daily has also increased of 16% on average, an increase of clearly superior value has thousand is displayed in all supermarkets.
The price, "which were themselves flown off" in the department stores of nutrition in December last year, have increased more brutally compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are of course shocked to see that Articles bought clearly under nine thousand year now more than ten thousand.
The daily basket in supermarkets probes exceeded to 91, at the very least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand.
And the highest value of basket came has 10 573 on.
(in 2003, this value was 6 800 Forints.)
The price of unicum and living fish have remained virtually at the level of the year, however, the price of the net of Turkey, of the process and the poppy strongly increased.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread has followed the data of ksh (Institute central statistics) but, at auchan, they found bread for a kilo has 139 on only.
Competition has not lower the price of the product 200 Forints.
It is amazing to see, also in the supermarket, that the price of the bottle recorded two litres of Coca-Cola was 200 Forints, it therefore that 257 on the bottle recorded including.
It empeche that this year, in terms of daily basket, auchan was more expensive and less expensive.
According to our calculations, cora has increased the price of his daily basket of 15 percent while Tesco, and auchan increased respectively of approximately 18% and 18%.
Comparing the most expensive basket of last year and the less expensive basket of this year, we note a gap of 12% while the difference between the least expensive of last year and the more expensive than this year is of 21%.
The prices have increased 1 480 on average.
Last year, the prices have increased 1 206 on average, while knowing that the impact of the increase in the rate of VAT was noticed in the prices of Christmas of last year.
This process has made trade perplexed, supermarkets could not determine obviously which limit apply to products as long as they were unable to foresee the impact of the change in the price to the consumer.
(if a dealer calculates the rotation of a product, it is likely to lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of commerce.)
Because of the change in the rate of VAT, the increase in the price of the daily basket has evolved so extreme that the most expensive basket was higher than 720 has the value of that from 2006 so that the difference between the less expensive baskets was that 844 on.
This year, the difference was not so extreme since the value of the most expensive basket was higher than 630 has one of the year and the prices of the least expensive increased by 1 284 also.
In comparing the two seasons Christmas, we have noted a calamitous increase prices, in less than 20 months the prices of articles of daily consumption have increased by more than 30% in supermarkets.
(this inevitably does not confirm the data of ksh: for certain of necessity, the statistics Institute noted a price increase of more than 30% in 12 months.
Such is the case, for example, of the flour and egg.)
According to the daily basket of the latter, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, very expensive last year, has increased hardly more than 10% compared to the basis.
According to indications, the suppliers of flour occupy a stronger position than the suppliers of eggs, because they have succeeded in doing to accept the sharp rise in prices by the multinationals.
In the triangle of gold, supermarkets do not complain, they always record of good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of the customers looks more prices in the three visited supermarkets.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the food of long conservation by palettes.
On Wednesday morning important tails formed in the cases of the three supermarkets, because the number of customers increased shortly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is less important in the province, numerous multinationals complain aupres companies survey does not reach the same number of business plan, not only for the food but also for the articles of sustainable consumption.
Many hospitals do the economy on the disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in the hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the surmenage medical personnel do not help has to block the infections, maintains the doctor in leader of the national centre of epidemiology.
Many hospitals do as the economy on the disinfectants
It is no longer an infection mrsa has been diagnosed in the service of the hospital.
The bacteria resistant to antibiotics has been detected on a man hospital following a serious accident.
The patient has been isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The casualty of a serious accident of car is out of the hospital but shortly after it has to go back there because of an infection mrsa and, since then, the doctors have not been able to make an important operation because of the bacterium which lies in its organization.
Up to 10 December of this year, 1 094 infections generated by an agent have been declared in the national system of monitoring, pointed out to böröcz, doctor in leader of the national centre of epidemiology.
That is to say that it is the number of infections caused by an agent that has actually been recorded in the hospitals and for the rest we do not have any information.
Approximately two thirds of infections (683 infections) have been caused by the mrsa, in other words by the resistant to the méthicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are carriers of the bacterium of aureus staphylococcus (his) in their noses it without a disease.
The infections caused by his (such as throat infections, cutaneous infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily curable.
However, if the antibiotics are used in an excessive or inappropriate, the bacteria, which is well to antibiotics, will develop a bacterium very resistant to antibiotics which will proliferate rapidly in the poor conditions.
In the event of poor provisional or extended by the immune system, this bacteria can cause serious infections, such as a traumatic infection or septicemia, on the elderly patients, small weight or having a weakened body.
According to the doctor manager of the hospital, there is nothing particularly in infections mrsa, these infections are part of the daily hospitals.
Above all, it should not confuse the infection with the epidemic, they do not find mrsa only or they are not sought, has said.
Her resist antibiotics.
"these patients are isolated, nurses puts on rubber and masks and we have antibiotics adapted for the care", has said.
A priori, the in-patients are examined whether they are carrying mrsa, though infection cannot always be avoided.
The sample is not the method
The great majority of infections caused by the mrsa could be warned, but the conditions and the present circumstances are not favourable, in hospitals Hungarians, to prevent the development and the proliferation of pathogenes agents, says to böröcz.
As this infection manifests itself in the hospitals and homes for the elderly, the hospitals should check the in-patients and isolate the ill holders of mrsa immediately.
Nevertheless the microbiological is not the method in the Hungarian hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the national case of social security does not finance these examinations.
The majority of cases sees the light of day that if the infection mrsa is only on the patient, has declared the doctor in leader of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has relating strict recommendations has adapted to the use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there is also the Hungarian directives for the recovery of certain infections and syndromes.
It must be made so that the antibiotic therapy is targeted, in other words the microbiological examinations should be carried out in order to empecher resistance to the drugs but the hospitals still do not take into account.
The realization of the microbiological is still more rare in the care and in the basic care, böröcz communicated.
Many hospitals do the economy on the disinfectants
The evidence shows that the proliferent a patient has another more often through the medical staff.
It is therefore essential to wash its hands, to put on and masks. However important gaps are detected in the hospitals also in this field.
The proliferent by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, because of the conditions in the Hungarian hospitals, the patient contaminated cannot always be isolated.
Furthermore, the rooms are often full, beds are often too close some of the others while in terms of epidemic, the patients should be removed some of the other of 1.5 to the minimum.
Unfortunately, we also note that, in a difficult situation, to make savings on the disinfectants, they lack of, the patients are numerous, so the risk of contamination is even greater, pointed out to böröcz.
According to böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is weaker demonstrable or even the proliferation of the agent can be blocked.
Governmental plan against the mrsa
The treatment of the infection mrsa represents exorbitant expenditure for the cases of social security, this is why one conflict everywhere against this infection.
In England, for example, the government has established a plan to prevent or reduce the incidence of mrsa.
According to the data published, this agenda is effective and infections mrsa show a tendency decreasing in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) revealed among its priorities for the prevention of the impact of the pathogenes agents (as the mrsa also) as well as the prevention of infections caused by these agents.

Bulgaria, paradise of the property market of the EU
The evolution of the Bulgarian property market is spectacular, the attention of all Europe is turned towards the countries of the Balkans little quoted by the past.
What, or and who buys on this market of the EU that is always the least expensive but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of re.
Currently, in housing, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most fashionable target of Europe with its flats winter and its houses to the seaside cheap.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are bansko, borovec, pamprovo and vitosa and, at the edge of the sea, albéna, "Sands and", the "coast of the sun", the former sozopol and nessebar but they are increasingly numerous has to seek a building in the area of kavarna and balcik also.
According to the analysis of re Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central area of the country, namely veliko tarnovo, gabrovo, Elena, triavna, also wake up the intéret investors, and they are also increasingly numerous has to buy in the corner of very dear to trick.
Sofia, the capital, offer attractive opportunities also, surfaces of trade and offices have the highest rate of redemption.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive paradise of course of Europe and to be a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors buy déja in large numbers, for example in the corner of bansko.
According to the analysis, the people buying a building in Bulgaria look at same time has to change their lives, their way of life.
The majority of the buyers are English but other arrive from France, Belgium, Spain and more in Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot are also present. By the Black Sea and in the most reputable winter resorts, we traditionally meet many buyers Russian.
The foreign buyers to be divided into three groups, said Georgij jankov, regional director of re Bulgaria.
The people who intend to settle buy the renovated buildings, has a price varying between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old houses deteriorated, has a price from 5 has 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are the easy and the possibilities of communication, the proximity of a large city, stores and in general that the local doctor.
The second group understands the purchasers of secondary (since last December, Bulgaria is quoted among the 10 destinations of holidays in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of accomplishing a gain a medium or long term.
The price of the buildings of the capital increases constantly due to an increasingly keen demand.
In the European Union, the real prices are the lowest in Bulgaria; however, these 5 years, they have increased by 21% every year.
The increase of property prices is primarily the increase in wages.
Fodor and six percent Hungarian
According to the communication of gábor fodor, Minister for the environment and water, the meetings of the professionals themselves on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening of the Ministers, the negotiations on the system of international climate after 2012 will continue.
The experts and politicians arriving from 192 countries of the world will discuss the road map of Bali to define the efforts has done after the period of reduction of emissions defined by the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, lively discussions are carried out on this subject between the countries in the process of developing and developed countries.
The United States have also announced that, for the moment, they do not want to discuss the exact figures, but that they were Prets has to sign an agreement on the reduction, up to 2020, of gas emissions has greenhouse effect of 25 has 40% in relation to the 1990 level.
Another important subject of the conference is to see if the developed countries start, the reduction of emissions, has to provide assistance and technological to the countries which need it.
An agreement has been signed also concerning has to provide aid to the developing countries.
The assistance funds defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 Members probably within the framework of the global fund for the environment of the UNO (gef), announced piac benefit (market and benefit).
The six percent of Hungary
In the name of Hungary, gábor fodor, Minister for the environment and water, confirms the ambition of the EU to keep its role of flagship in total efforts have to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister has explained that the EU has started to reduce before 2020 its gas emissions has greenhouse effect of 20% compared to the level attained in 1990, regardless of the success of the signature of the "agreement of after 2012", and it was prete has cut up to 30% if the other great regions of the world and / or the developing countries were Prets also has to take on their responsibility and has adapted their capacities.
Gábor fodor has pointed out that in 1997, the signatory countries of the Kyoto Protocol had aimed at the total a reduction of 5.2% and the whole of the 15 Member States of the EU to this time has pledged on 8% less.
Hungary undertook to reduce the gas emissions has greenhouse effect of 6% compared to the level of the period between 1985 and 1987, our countries will fill his commitment, reminds us of the press release of the Ministry of the environment.
The issue is great in Bali, because the international agreement on the long-term climate policy must be put in place in the space of two years, if not the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be rejected after 2012; in this case, the commitments of reduction below the values proposed in the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately followed by a new international system of reduction of emissions which the need has been underlined in the new report by IPCC, international scientific body, which has received the Nobel Prize of the peace to tackle climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth of more than 2 ° C could not be avoided any more which, according to the scientists, would have serious consequences and definitive.
The British army recruits on youtube
The unity of the British army communicate, on the site of distribution of video recordings carried out at the time of its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the aim of making popular.
First, it is the British air force (RAF), which is a passion for youtube: the special units intervening in Afghanistan assigns the video sequences on the operations carried out against the Taliban since March 2006, has announced the BBC.
These recording, taken using miniature cameras organized on a helmet, are checked at the headquarters of the operations of the air force has to Kandahar, and they are then transferred to London or the compatriots charge on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
The soldiers of the air force have passed 139 sequences on the net in this way and their "chain" has been looked at by more than 75 thousand people.
The Ministry of Defence British registered under the name of "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 and it communicates videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, whereas the Ministry of the Commonwealth (Commonwealth Office) and the international forces of maintaining peace in Iraq (mnfi) also have their own channels on youtube.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, videos have been passed on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also has to make known to the general public the real objectives of the presence of the army abroad.
The propaganda published by the way coute virtually nothing compared to the past usual advertisements of recruitment to the television, communicated to the BBC Gordon mackenzie, consulting in defence; on the other hand, it also inevitably carries a political message since it justifies under a special form the relevance of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have made a game
The army is embetée because, apart from the videos composed and censured carefully, videos amateurs are passed on the site of shares that also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the publicity films "official", a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses, but they do not present the bloody side of the fighting.
Moreover, many videos were spent on the net presenting the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were carried out on real mission, but the British army is carried away for the loading of these videos that recently.
The Americans make recruitment a little differently in using the game of America 's army free. In this game the player can put directly to the place of the soldiers in the framework of a simulation more or less real.

Political capital: the Hungarian guard has increased the risk country
According to the division risk analysis of political capital (risk division), the activity of the Hungarian guard, constituted in August last year, with the support of the jobbik magyarországért mozgalom (movement for a better Hungary) increases, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and of the region.
In its "warning of risk", the company announces that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian guard, the greatest political risk is déja that "in the short term ethnic clashes aggressive can occur following the worsening of the ethnic tension déja existing between the population gypsy and not gypsy Hungary".
The research institute has added that the political strategy of the Hungarian guard aiming probably has to cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, it is one of the main gaps in the Hungarian political actors: "the public actors have crossed the public debate on the matter of the Roma, the representatives of the radical political groupings and which have a political strategy based on the disagreement between the gypsies and the Hungarians."
The problem is some aggravated, the normal dialogue becomes impossible, the extremists have reinforced and the arrival of the aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the influence of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media to the activity of the Hungarian guard "has deteriorated significantly the image of Hungary abroad, in particular concerning the confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They say that, following a greater publicity given the reorganization of the radical groups and Hungarian upright since the autumn of 2006, numerous associations have been constituted in Hungary since the summer 2007 giving the name of "national association of self-defence."
"The common feature of this gathering is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members has missions of defence (disasters, national defence, defence force), armed if it is necessary, in addition, by pointing out the disability of the police, the army, in other words the State", added.
They have reported that everything was in accordance with the method which, by relying on the resentment of society and of the political parties, seeks to disguise a different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis put on the civil and the statute of association is therefore only that has to avoid the legal rights of the recording of these associations in the Court, but they are also a political strategy.
The analysis signals that the activity of the Hungarian guard is a factor which also increases the risk in relation to the relations of neighbourhood.
"in recent months, many countries quote the Hungarian guard as a potential source of risk and the political actors of some bordering countries wish to justify their political anti-Hungarian in referring to the Constitution of the Hungarian guard.
This influences the political stability of the region, "added.
According to the Institute of research, the Constitution of the Hungarian guard is not a unique in Central Europe, the political risks have increased over the whole of the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian guard looks, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian national guard which the Constitution has been declared by the Bulgarian National Union (bnu) in 2007.
The many confusion of Roma who burst in an area of Sofia (kraszna poljana) are at the origin of the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
Taking advantage of these events, bnu decided to constitute a guard in saying that the objective of the organization is national self-defence ".
According to them, these 17 years, Romany "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, points out the political capital.
They have added that the initiative had aroused lively debate in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the declaration of certain organizations of Roma Bulgarians regarding the constitution of their own guard by way of resistance signals to the increase in the risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian national guard excluded that Roma Hungarian react to the threat in the same way by their own self-defence, they can read in the warning of the risk of political capital.
At the request of the news of the Agency telegraph, Attila juhász, Director of research of political capital, has said: the risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he has said, their risk analysis is published every year and if events occurred which could have an impact on the change of the risk, they inform public opinion, as in the present case, publishing a warning of risk.
The is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law that defines exactly the days of around and, of the, it has become common to reorganize working days which will reduce the number of next year.
The are not uniform in the EU and the United States.
The Hungarian legislation distinguishes the days of national and state as the day of rest.
The rest days are often linked has religious or has important historical events.
In Hungary, we fetons new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also rest days, all the more so as the réveillonneurs can rest easy.
Moreover, in one year, we have in all eleven marked in red.
On 15 March is a national, in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as the 23 October, so that is the commemorative day of the revolution of 1956.
The 20 August, we fetons the constitution of our State, 1 May is the work and the 1 and 2 November, we remember the members of our family and friends died.
In addition, we have two days have Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our fetes of state, national or religious seldom falling over the weekend, according to the timetable, it has become common to reorganize the days in the case or it is that a day before or after the marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of the weekend extended working or going to the school on Saturday preceding the weekend extended.
For years, the Minister of Labour rules in a regulation on the days of replacement of the preceding days or following the.
The law is spread to all employers and employees, for all their employees on the officials and the people working in the public service.
It is not, however, for the service companies, the institutions turning without interruption and in operation, by their vocation, and also for the rest days.
This year, the days of work will be modified only around of the of the end of the year: from 24 December, life is much practically in all the countries, because according to the experiences of the majority of the people made rather overtime or go on holiday that they have saved has these aims to be able to spend days between the world of the Christmas and New Year to them.
The next year a lot of fetes falls to the environment or to the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in the level of working days in relation to this year.
The timetable will be reorganized the first time around the work to enable employees to stay at home four days of sharp.
On Saturday 25 April will be a day of work to have a day of rest on Friday, 2 May.
Another change is envisaged for the 23 October: the Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing the Friday 24.
On the other hand, the next year, the end of the year is coming under the sign of the bus from 24 December, everyone will have a break nonstop same if the day of the new year falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things which can embeter terrifically
E-mails that we forget to send, of the messages that we do not accept, innocent lies that we almost more: these are things that "embellish" the daily of a place of work.
The question is whether they are used in these troubles or one raises the challenge and it avoids the ambiguous situations consciously, causing troubles in others.
Examples.
"I, I forgot to say to you that you called service marketing", you said a colleague.
That you missed a date?
At best it is sorry and tries to arrange things in calling for their marketing service to say that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common resolution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is sorted out with excuses.
Before having hard explanation, it is useful to think how you will be able to talk about the unpleasant moments in your colleagues and to make efforts to avoid.
You something which does not belong to you?
There is nothing more irritating that want to take a file, a tool automation or the telephone and you do not find them anywhere.
You will remember that the day before you put the stapler on the office but it has gone the following morning?
You find incidentally your pen that you believed lost on the office of your colleague?
Do not take anything has your colleagues without asking if they have reason to be annoyed with you have pricked their well.
Do not envelopes, - it in your pocket, because it can be embetant that there is not any more and that you need immediately.
You chatter of the private life of colleagues?
It is not good means for arreter pewters who spread.
Who does what, with that?
Or, and why?
Do not tell all the world your information (assumptions) on the private life of your colleagues!
If a colleague shares his personal secrets with you, do not abuse his confidence!
Bury in your shared information and does not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence if your colleagues are also knows.
You yourself patient without fair reason?
When you call the office and you yourself patient under the pretext of an evil of tearing because you feel badly or you have need of rest this day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent matters, your future missions must be carried out by someone other has your position.
Do not make troubles has your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you will not work or that something can happen which would oblige you has to stay at home, do not forget to tell your leader, and your colleagues to avoid that they were surprised at your lack the following.
Humming, sniggering, telephone
You in your work, but the sniggering of your colleagues you in tears brutally?
You have become, without wanting to, witness to a discussion by telephone that you would have better does not listen?
Do not disturb your colleagues with humming, humming, discussions have high voice - that you above their Tete), beatings, big words or expressed has high voice.
They can disturb same if your colleagues are not plunged into a project (writing, design, organization).
You accuse the others to a mistake?
If your work is not made for the deadline set, you forget to send a letter or an important message, accuses anyone for this neglect!
Do not put it on account of the possible chaos in the office or your loud!
Acknowledge it if you have made a mistake, and if it has presented the disadvantages for the others, to make up for the mistake!
Ask how you could make up your fault, repairs negligence!
You feel too at home in office?
Put a jogging and is comfortable in the House, but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not put a same comfortable jogging if your duty it!
Would not be neglected, respect your colleagues and you-same by equipping you properly, and if your duty requires putting pretty and smart, to go to work!
If you want to respond to the expectations, you are not more interesting
They advance slowly in the usual Cork in the morning.
Suddenly, a special melody made to understand the radio: the voice of a violin has which electronic effects are linked.
I take up his.
The music changes pace and the low comes to accompany the tone by all the time, then a female comes to join as a true jewel.
Mr2 diffuse the song wings of zagar.
The Hungarian musical life do not spoil us for a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
However, now it appears that the Cork alters if you listen to the new album of zagar.
The appearance of yonderboi, some interesting new productions born of numerical Hungarian start little by little has to change the overall picture and, in spite of the new method of the rock of garage tearing the, the Hungarian proves that there is again under the sun.
Balázszságer is able to pécs and he played itself in the Group of yonderboi before it launches in its own way, perhaps because there is no place for two feet in the same footwear. "
His plan (zagar) and its music, a alloy of jazz, electronic and pop music, has started to make known when one has entrusted the composition of filmed (for example
The season of Ferenc török).
The training working at the beginning in small clubs began to be experienced by a more general public when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the most important discs of Hungarian market and has declared zagar, with yonderboi, almost alone creators of the Hungarian tendency which would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his group became unquestionably "trendy", but no one has asked whether they wanted to carry this label.
The group has reacted properly, it has gone out a new and better disc.
The titled cannot walk instead, taken recently, can open new channels for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the past years has pécs.
It is that it was a line of the Group of pécs of balázszságer.
We are well with the reference to the flight but side of the air music appears, in accordance with the spirit and the tendency of the time, stronger, impact of rock and roll.
György ligeti, singer working in England, with the group the jigsaw, has shown his talent in these songs during the first of the millennium in the park.
On the, one finds a true tube for radio, mr2 petõfi, broadcasting recently popular music from morning till night, has started to introduce the wings of recorded with six Hungarian singers ("divas").
Everything is going well therefore (?).
Hvg.hu asked questions has balázszságer.
Hvg.hu: this new tube pushes me has to ask a question: is it your music remain a music aiming at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: the term of music, aiming at a certain layer does not call me great thing.
For me there are two classes in the music; not or underground, no alternative but to commercial or pop music and music.
The alternative one saying alternatives, can be equally poor and made only to sell and become so trade.
However, a good pop song can also.
The attitude of reception works in this spirit also independently of the language or the borders.
Hvg.hu: do you see a difference between the Hungarian public and foreign, one or the other is more open in your music?
Zs.b.: abroad, especially the West music has older traditions.
People go to the concerts and not only the young people of a dozen or so years but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention to the changes which have occurred in music, because they think that it also forms part of the contemporary culture.
Hvg.hu: what is the role of the public in your work?
You are interested to know that, where and how many people listen to your music?
Zs.b.: I am of course glad to see that people are increasingly numerous has our concerts.
However we have never made music to the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a precise reason.
The role of the public is more important to the concerts or mutual influence works déja but it is perceived as in the elusive changes of the moment.
However, I have noticed that if you wanted to respond to the expectations of the public, you will not be more interesting.
Hvg.hu: do you intend to follow the example of yonderboi?
It only works and made career rather the West.
Zs.b.: we really do not follow its path if sometimes some people try to find traces in our music.
We are rather players team that trust the musical presence of the other and let themselves.
Initially, it was inevitable that well on our music is compared has one of yonderboi because we are several has to leave his group and has to take another way.
Hvg.hu: on the palmares of mr2 petõfi, wings occupy the place.
Many of those who have spoken on behalf of zagar for the first time by means of this song.
With this more popular style you opened consciously towards a broader layer?
Zs.b.: we did not expected to make a tube to be able to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it to the end of the to try to soften the orgy of sound and the more difficult themes in the whole disc.
Hvg.hu: how did you choose six singers?
The reason why they - which was the hot line?
Zs.b.: the idea was to have a society of the kind.
We have had the idea to prepare this society of good soloists of the Hungarian musical.
Thus was composed the society has six Members, namely sena, judie jay, bori péterfy, enikõ hodosi [neo], németh, that they then underground divas.
Hvg.hu: you wanted this song like this or girls changed little?
Zs.b.: this piece existed déja for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we have made up the, we thought that it lacked still something to this song.
The continuation of agreements has attracted the voice of the song.
I have sung the night the tone that girls have learnt later.
I have had almost immediately and everything was spontaneous.
I remember that I galvanized at the time but quite sure we needed divas.
With my vote, it would not have had the same force.
Hvg.hu: on the disk and in concert equally it seemed to me that the girls were in plan.
There is no solo (with the exception of a solo short of jay), they have not only role, they sing together and they do not sing stronger than the music, therefore the music does not only to accompany the song.
They were derriere on the scene.
Is it wanted?
Zs.b.: the fact that they were in plan is only a technical problems.
On the other hand, which was voluntary, it is because we did not want to distribute's roles.
The song also says that we must forget our ego a bit, forget that comes from, or which will or, it is fair to leave that these wings, the wings of love, we take.
I wanted the others also feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song is born.
Hvg.hu: which songs you made the most work?
Zs.b.: in actual fact, no according to the process of musical creation, we have had more difficult pieces during the mix.
For example, with dorian Gray's dilemma, or I play a grand together, or with to the girls, or the groove did not want to work for a long time, and then, gradually, everything is put in place as in a puzzle.
Hvg.hu: what is your one on the new album?
Zs.b.: this is changing all the time with the concerts and of the fact that I have déja "released" this disc.
At present, they are taught, escape from the earth and never the same.
The perfidious risked billion because of its inferiority complex
A secretive smuggler.
Thus refers to its former used the French giant the general, the owner of the Czech bank banka.
The Bank has lost because of it almost five billion euros.
Now it seems rather than kerviel is that a big player who wanted to equate his colleagues, and which, moreover, can by no means be regarded as incompetent.
Contrary to all the big houses of bank, it has recognized at once the crisis of the American market of mortgages.
"It is fragile," implied his superiors who have denounced in the police force.
However, if we stick to the deposition of kerviel brought by the French media, including the world, the transactions of this man produced at the end of last year a profit coming to 1.6 billion euros.
The crisis is the United States
"all that I wanted to, it was to earn money for my bank", asserts in deposition.
Last summer, it has managed to take advantage of the American crisis to gain a half billion euros.
In fact, it felt the time as early as the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February according to which the mortgages known as "sub-prime", granted to customers with low income or to those who had met in the past of the difficulties of reimbursement, would have problems.
But this crisis should not have an influence on the whole of the economy.
Kerviel did not believe in and it well.
So, at the end of the year, its benefits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"as soon as I had won my first half billion, I did not know how to say", entrusted and adds that it has, of course, nothing kept for itself.
In all the interrogation, it had to have distorted the reports in order not to be identified.
It has managed to deceiving his superiors, although the grant started to be interested in its dealings.
That risks nothing has anything
Did it to be found?
Rather not.
"I thought that the mere fact of having obtained 1.6 billion for the Bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does its willingness to risk if large?
It did not succeed in his post that gradually.
It had started to work with the general in 2000 after having finished at the University of Lyon.
Its annual salary revolved around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, it was already assistant of tradeur and, in 2005, it became independent with an annual salary of 90 thousand dollars.
However, he knew that he would never as much as the others.
"from my first discussion in 2005, I knew that I was considered much less than the others.
With regard to my university programme and of my professional and personal route ", added to the investigators.
However, shortly after its coming into office, it gains its first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, it has won a half billion euros in betting on the decrease in this way at the time of the attacks in London.
And the mechanism was released - it wanted more.
As long as you win, they leave you in peace
"it was like a snowball effect ', it says in the police officers.
But the superior during the course of all, or rather, they suspected it.
"as long as I, they were semblance of closing the eyes."
However, it is then that the blow of the beginning of the year.
It loses a billion euros in a day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, it decides to conceal the sum.
On Monday, when it comes to employment, it is no longer employee of the Bank.
A few days later, the Bank announces that it has lost five billion euros because of it.
And how they discovered?
It has become suspicious because of its leave.
"last year, I have taken only four days off.
A trader that does not go on holiday is a trader that does not want to let his book with another ", ends up.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the Ministers of the Czech Government signed in all nine operational programs with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the years to come, to bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Crowns Czech) in the Czech Republic.
It is almost half of the whole of the sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly 125 billion Crowns resulting from seven operational programs will be intended for the Czech regions.
The Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately 100 billion Crowns within the framework of business and innovation.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part, up to 150 billion.
The transport is the most important operational and accounts for up to 22% of the financial means that Czech can obtain in the framework of these projects.
This money will be at the beginning of an increase in the budget of the national bottom of the infrastructure of transport which is going to deal with next year a sum of 90.8 billion Crowns.
The business and innovation, intended for SMEs and the contractors, must be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within the company.
The companies should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new methods of management more efficient.
Up to now, Czech, formed part of the new members, the beneficiaries of the funds of the EU, the less crowned with success.
The Court has confirmed the death of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua has confirmed on Thursday to 20 years in prison for the former President of the country Arnold Alemán, to which it has been condemned in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (about 1.8 billion Crowns).
However, later he has been released and lived assigned to residence in his Hacienda close to the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former leader of the state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be or not again encarcéré is for the time being, according to the Agency PA, clear.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal ileana Pérez, everything will depend on maintaining the agents of prison, or they will leave aleman finish the trouble to him, or go again in prison.
There are four years, the Court has proved that Alemán regularly moved the money of the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
It is a matter of companies and the accounts actually belonged to the members of his family and his supporters.
A part of this money has gone into the funds that Alemán was created in order to finance the election campaign in 2001.
We adopted the budget
This is so.
The State budget has been adopted.
What is this budget special?
It is the first budget designed by the government and accepted by the majority of government without the backing of the opposition.
The one for the current year has passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - since this is the Minister who had prepared and could not afford its refusal.
In contrast to the restless debate before the vote of the declaration of distrust in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
Parliament has adopted without any problem this law which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
This is a kind of paradox.
That they want it or not, each chapter and every item is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of the policy, though concealed behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive media and it is to this that we grant him more attention in the media.
The arguments of the politicians interest much more to the opinion that the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past Socialist governments suffered three evil than the present budget is not ready to regulate at the time.
The first is the important part granted at the expense of mandates imposed by law, consisted not only by the retirement, but also by the social contributions, adopted last year by the "Alliance" silent with the parties and.
The second is a poor economics, as a result of the first badly.
The third obstacle, it is constituted by the deficit of public finances, i.e. by the deficit of cities and towns.
However, this is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the greatest risk.
This is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb, it is the deficit of cities and towns.
Many mayors often issued, stunned, obligations, involving in debt their municipalities, in order to obtain, set aside money coming from taxes, tax laws and the appropriations of bank, of new sources of investment.
In the past years, they succeeded to repay this debt by the sale of the actions of the mass distribution systems, in particular those of the energy, obtained from the state in the framework of the privatization.
Today, they do not have more of this souce.
If they are only held in official and verifiable facts, we note that:
Our economy already crosses for several years, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and does not lack of will in itself.
It was a unique opportunity for the successive governments of this party to sort out the public finances.
However, instead of this, they state more and more.
Other countries, torn apart from a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, managed their business in a much more reasonable than our Republic.
This is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on the previous governments.
We are part of the country which, on a global scale, are threatened by poverty.
We have therefore no need for massive social programs which, precisely in the last few years, unfortunately unnecessarily.
Although they succeed in eliminating a part of the absurd populist expenditure, approved last year before the elections, if a shift of the age limit for retirement, so that a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then all policy will cease to exist in that country, and anyone who is in power, it will be only to manage.
While hardly, one can say that the politicians in capacity will become bureaucrats distributing the majority of money imposed between pensions and social security benefits.
This is the reason why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that fact that the ordinary expenses are rejected by the expenses of mandates.
The deficit of 70 billion scheduled for 2008 will be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not dispelled all the money that they could.
If we really do not want it to happen that the policies to be able to become simple bureaucrats, it is necessary for us to be patient and to grant this coalition government fragile, aware that the state cannot spend that the equivalent of this that it manages to take in taxes and tax laws, the necessary calm to the preparation of new laws of reform.
It is that these latter that will make it possible to reach a balanced state budget progressively.

The banks to want to regulate the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks English, Switzerland and Canadian have decided to fight together the crisis of the financial markets.
More than one hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the money markets by the bid.
It will be a matter for the banks to sell, by a system of bids, the interest rate they are ready to borrow money.
By way of example, the American EDF will send auction 40 billion dollars, and, furthermore, it will provide 24 billion to the European Central Bank and Switzerland.
This is the first time since the attacks of September that the central banks of individual States have decided on a concerted action at this point, to prevent or reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"this move tends to regulate the major problems of the economy, that is to say the increasing lack of free capital that banks could lend ', writes in his report to the customers Bernard baumohl society of Council economic group.
"the joint action of the central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65% to around 50%", adds baumohl in his report.
The banks have already lost 60 billion dollars because of the loans not refunded, especially in the United States.
The analysts await further losses of billions.
"if the central banks have chosen this step, it is that they should actually understand what can still be", known as the chief economist of ABN AMRO Davies.
"It appears that the situation is really bad", it adds.
The central banks fear that, if the banks will have a difficult access to loans, they will be more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and plunge the American economy in recession that can have an influence on the economic growth of the entire world.
The central banks have made this choice after one has not managed to lower the rate of London, called libor, used to take on the market.
This meant that the banks always feared the mutual loans, even though the American, Canadian and English central banks have reduced on several occasions, during the autumn, their interest rates.
"it will have the same effect as a new lower rates of interest", said to the Agency Reuters Greg salvaggio society Tempus consulting.
Certain analysts do not believe that the step of the central banks will not contribute to avert the crisis, since it does not regulate the main problem which is the fall of the property market to the USA.
The President Klaus: the debate of the environmentalists are incredible
The global climatic changes are supposed to harm to the developing countries.
The president Václav Klaus again came to a conclusion on the problems of global warming.
The criticism is down this time on the international conference of the United Nations on the climate change finishing in Bali.
In Vienna, where he has presented his book the blue, not Green, it has stated that the debates of the ecologists were unconvincing.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, constituted by a curious mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference that there is between the accompanying rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, this is only a missile of words, substitute solutions to the current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that its subject to him a great importance, and it is for that that it is for this reason.
It has also expressed its satisfaction that his book also appears in the German translation, since, he said, "I do not often that the caricature of my opinions".
Consequently, the persons concerned can read its positions without their being distorted.
Klaus has pointed out that although it is not a, it has nevertheless, in his opinion, enough of provisions to write a book.
This is in fact a Academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, it has the practice of statistics, and it is also an economist.
The major conclusions of the book, according to him, the following theses: the climate is changing continuously, changes of this are therefore normal, it is not a view shared by all researchers on the global warming, the effects of the current changes are not too high or too serious, they are therefore no danger and, finally, the efforts to influence the climate change are useless, inefficient and expensive.
So much more than having the experience of a totalitarian regime, it regards as unacceptable to impose opinions on the other, what it feels like a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of the people present, he explained on several occasions that it was not against a reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist which does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits that they bring ".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago, to the Institute Hayek.

Polívka lost (the Kingdom of valašsko)
Bolek polívka has lost the dispute about the mark (Kingdom of valašsko).
According to the judge of the regional court of Ostrava, it is indeed it that was used for the first time the King of valašsko, but the project has been set up by the team around harabis, a former colleague of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's sitting.
However, according to his lawyer, the matter is probably not finished and its customer will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr harabiš and his team exploit on the popularity of bolek polívka," said after the process the lawyer of polívka.
According to him, the words of valašsko recall everyone precisely this actor and comical.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"there is behind us a work of almost ten years ago.
Research and development of events "he said.
According to him, it is money that is the cause of the dispute.
"after years, they have realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
It is to them that want to exploit on our work ", it added.
A profitable business
According to the Court, it is polívka that used for the first time the title (King of valašsko) in his television broadcast.
The actor radoslav brzobohatý was crowned King in 1993.
However, at the time, it did not have a relationship with the plan to set up an imaginary Kingdom.
A few years later, harabiš came with the idea of publishing the passports of the.
A humorous action at the beginning it left a business and a profitable commercial activity, followed by the creation, by harabiš, society.
In 1997 polívka has accepted that his name and his signature are quoted in the passport and it has even proposed the holders of balances on the price of the visit of his farm and its shows of theatre.
Who is going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge has also mentioned that harabis has made that use the bare idea, published by polívka in the transmission, for commercial purposes.
"the popularity of Boleslav polívka has helped the project," said the judge.
She has added, however, that the heart of the project was constituted by harabiš and his team who devoted to the project in an intense.
The collaboration between the parties now enemy continue until 2000 when harabiš organized for polívka an official crowning to vsetín.
But from there, conflicts have begun to accumulate between polívka harabiš, which culminated with deposition "King Boleslav 1st elected for always".
The leadership in the Kingdom was then, under the inspiration of harabiš, accepted by the singer jarmila šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, polívka lodged a complaint against harabiš and its society, demand that the Court has now been rejected.
What could get to the bottom of the matter, it is the tournament envisaged for the throne and a half of the Princess.
It should leave a new king.
It did not want to betray the details and the date.
"We do not want to move quickly to work.
That would be quelquechose as the procession of kings atslovácko.
The King would be elected for a long time.
Even Mr polívka can of course register ", has added harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti: prejudice
To tell the truth, I have never been a great fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its qualities of bearing were nothing extraordinary, the quality of the gears, control and also that of the manufacture, could, in many ways, be described as inferior to the average.
However, now it is on the market his successor Peugeot 207 which, it is clearly better.
So much more than the named sw still goes a step further, we do not have more than to better reflect.
While I tested the traditional of Peugeot 207 I am for example of the space for the head on the seats.
While there finished complaints because the body means that even the main demons will, in this respect, to ease.
Let us see quickly made
I am going to recall very quickly within the not too much.
It is a matter of a design more or less succeeded, my only remark concerning the central which seems to me poor.
Here, I would have liked a design a little more inventive, given that the car seems so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when they could complain of seats or about too short is completed.
The guidance is also clearly improved in relation to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase of the dimensions of the body is sensitive there too.
The sees disappear also the lack of places above the head already mentioned.
A trunk in the trunk
The most important on the vehicle, it is therefore hissoutte to luggage.
I must assess this as very well accessible (also thanks to the ice back) and of a rather easy.
The blind areas are provided with bands of stopping which constitute a compromise ideal.
It is not cumbersome and can be spread all being able to hold asez heavy objects.
But let us in volume.
This fact, according to the pictures, 428 l in the shape of base, which is in relation to the competition to a rather average figure.
Setting aside the škoda combi, transport more sold this category in the Czech Republic.
If one compares the 207 sw with the new generation of the product of mlada Boleslav, we note that Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it is a matter of some off from abroad or charge poussette, this figure is almost criticism.
But, if I were to emphasize the advantages, I would mention the history of remaining after the overthrow of the files of the rear seats perfectly right, or a very low.
120 horses divided on four cylinders
The car that we have tested was equipped with a Otto engine of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 L and a power of 88 KW.
To tell the truth, and it is to that that should look a 1.6 who did go to a family.
It is silent, consume little and, especially, it pushes well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by? which often gives the impression of having a pot blocked by a serpillère, then I can be as enthusiastic.
Let the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not reasonable by all.
However, we must be aware that they tested a car rather well equipped, with a Interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an engine Otto 1.4 litres coming to 329 900 is still acceptable.
The vehicle that we have tested costs from 410 900, which is already enough.
The equipment, also tested, increase the price of 80 000.
However, we have laid out in more airbags, of an automatic air-conditioning, of automatic, an automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the day 531 900.
This is a lot, but try to add the additional equipment and you will acquire a very similar figure.
It is therefore more than to choose the mark.
The integration of the Slovak pupils in the schools goes badly
The number of children originating from the countries of Eastern Europe in schools is growing, which causes to the concerns about the evolution of the local education.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans itself, for the moment, with a series of obstacles.
The schools note, even in the case of the conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of Kent of the north, where start increasing conflicts opponents and immigrants of Slovak origin illustrates the problem of the integration of children originating from Eastern Europe.
The arguments, the baffle and fights between students are transposed in the relations between the parents.
The situation has gone so far as the police arrested in chatham a Slovak woman who struck with an iron bar a pupil of ten years ago.
The culprit is active in asserting that the boy was insulted it by rasistes.
The police has also had to intervene following the attack against a Slovak immigrant led by two adolescents.
The young girls were addressed to this man racist remarks and had cast stones.
"when we returned to the House, a young person has climbed cessation of bus and has started to us spit above.
When I told him to stop, it has answered by apples and pears and then it has discovered the backside ", has described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are formulated by both parties.
One of the remaining went up to qualify the conflicts with the immigrants to fight for survival.
The cases mentioned above testify that the atmosphere in the schools between the inhabitants of origin and the immigrants is beginning to be tightened.
70 thousand Slovak come to find work are recorded in Great Britain.
And approximately 30 thousand Slovak students attend schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For the visitors, it really is an island of freedom.
All that you wait for your leave can be carried out if you make a good choice.
Beaches and white as snow, high waves or even a calm sea as a pond.
The and the inclusive all with waiters giving you on the beach a pizza, ice or cocktails.
The kitesurfing, the course and the Castor.
On the islands of the sea of caraîbes, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find still much more and it is Cuba, the greatest and most beautiful island of the great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described as the most beautiful place that human eye has ever seen.
The Havana became the deposit and the place of transfer of treasures that the Spanish had stolen and that they transported in Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Nacional was established at the very beginning of the Twenties'.
It is Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, who has been built, since all that was a crime in the USA (especially under the prohibition) was accepted and supported in Cuba: the drug, games of chance, prostitution.
Among its customers, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, buildings in height grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the Fifties' of the last century, were on the boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco of Paula, about the Havana, and, in cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the showbusiness and politicians of the whole America left their signatures on the walls of the bodeguita del Medio.
And today?
You can leave yourself your autograph on the walls of the bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the hotel Nacional, a luxury, you are the cocktail of your choice.
And these cars worship always circulates in Havana, since the jigoulis and formerly imported Fiats have already long since, in a climate and so wet, climate.
Although the Havana, especially the oldest part, is approximately decrepit, nullepart elsewhere in the vicinity there is so much monuments colonial splendid there is precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example how.
Given that tourism is the money if necessary, its development in the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels did not only in Havana, but especially in varader, on the coast of the province, and also on the small islands such as cayo Coco, cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba is still a fantasy that is unique in the world, and which will be especially appreciated by amateurs small trains.
The cane was returned from the vast plantations in sweets on a narrow way by small trains and steam engine.
Their travelling material has not been renewed for dozens of years and this is so that we can see in March of the small engines which contemporaries are only in museums elsewhere.
To direct its?
The majority of the visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
There is therefore no need to write about varadero or on the Havana.
If not to point out that in the ownership of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum, and that someone who loves this writer should not spoil the visit.
The valley of the west of the island is one of the most gauged.
A vegetation grows on a calcium ground.
Mogotes, experimentation and rocks zoom from the bottom of the valley, and, with the fertile ground being taken in their, even its rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where they probably cultivate tobacco Cuban of better quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of the factories of cigars in Havana.
Someone will perhaps also interesting because it is there that was turned the episode of major Zeman.
How
Old City based shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It is the market to the business of slaves and that of sugar, which brought the glory and wealth.
The wealth embodied in the beauty and the character of this city of reduced size.
Will koloniální? pan ovlivnná architektura, výrazn? ovlivn? ná.
How, situated between the sea and solid mass escambray, is a place in such point out of the way that again in the fifties' of the last century, there was no way that link in this area with the rest of the country.
This isolation has allowed to remain on the sidelines.
We did not build anything, and this is why they do nothing either, each be satisfied to have a roof over the head.
If they have, how, the more time that an afternoon, then it is worth the trouble to go to see also places in the vicinity, such as the beach playa ancón or the valley of sweets.
Then, in the evening, it is the custom to go to the música which itself after down to the sun, and where the music is that to the small hours.
Baracoa
Some refer to this village situated to the extreme is Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is indeed already influenced by the way that leads.
The two roads which lead for Guantánamo must overcome high and injured mountains and cross a landscape almost without brands of human activity.
UNESCO has included the shelf is of Cuba, thanks to its landscape intact, on the list of world heritage.
It produces the best chocolate, to the church, there is the Cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, she has seen the light of day almost a hundred years after the journey of Columbus) and since the hill, where the old chateau-fort is held and the current hotel El Castillo, one sees many mountains table, which is the most famous El yunque.
On the subject of coffee, rum, cigars, mountainous massive Sierra, of the Bay of sows and island Isla de pinos, cabaret Tropicana, from the Saint of Cuba caridad del cobre, santeria, African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, on the subject of all that they could meet a number of pages.
Only, as you rightly said, it is better to see a time.
In Afghanistan, the allies are passive, affirm the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary influences, according to the United States, on the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Defence Minister Robert gates, NATO should sketch a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission in Afghanistan does not proceed as it should, agreed at Edinburgh in Scotland the representatives of countries which have troops in the southern part of the country.
Next to the increasing protest on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved also discuss today future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States have called this week through the Defence Minister Robert gates NATO troops to a greater activity, the United Kingdom sees as priority the reinforcement of the authority of the Afghan Government and the enhancement of development aid.
"the trend in Afghanistan is perceptible, but the military power can constitute only a part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and of the security ", said in the chain BBC Defence Minister of Browne.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to the data of the American army, the more intense the past five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27% in comparison with last year, up to 60% in the province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have approximately 40 thousand soldiers in Afghanistan, which nearly a quarter in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and the equipment of troops.
In concrete terms, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts to drive of the troops.
"We will have to reflect seriously on the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as on the ways how to reach", said gates.
The Secretary General of NATO de Hoop held today similar.
"I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have more or less Ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment which we would need, and this is not enough, "said Hoop at the Agency Reuters at the end of the talks with the Japanese Government in Tokyo which lasted three days.
That is passive
These last months reign equally between the countries involved in conflicts concerning the question whether all the allies do indeed all their possible in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for passivity.
"the Germans have a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, combat the requirements to which they are subject, therefore, are not as strict as those in the south and the east of the country where we operate, "said gates.
The tabloid britanique sun has described this week the German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight", has written sun in a document supplemented by photographs of German soldiers playing to the table.
The German newspaper Bild is passed to the counter-attack in publishing the picture of a troop during a game of rugby in the southern part of Afghanistan.

Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion Crowns, "said the analyst of Patria finance David Marek for waiter
The anticipation of the analyst of next finance Vladimír pikor is similar: "they could exceed the billion in the course of the year 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that we still do not know.

But I do not wait for this change, "he clarified.
The debts grow
The national debt is constituted by the debts of the central government and it is mainly generated by the cumulation of the deficits of the budget of the State.

The average of the national debt rose in years.
"the total debt has increased the first in the third quartal of 13%, which is, taking into account the actual good health of the economy, a figure far too high.
It is interesting that the increase is especially generated by the government bonds when it reached 20%.
It is bad that debt is growing, but on the other hand it points out that there are grounds to negotiate while comes from the reform of the pensions ", has commented on the data.
Better than what they expect
It follows the strategy of the financing and the management of the national debt for the year 2007 as the government had planned to borrow 159,2 billion Crowns this year.
Now, at the beginning of September, thanks to an evolution of the economies of the budget of the State better than expected, the Ministry has reduced the amount envisaged in 152,8 billion Crowns.
The sum is mainly made up by the deficit of the budget of the state which will obviously obviousness 76 billion Crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion Crowns initially envisaged.
Secondly, it is a matter of sources foreseen for the job of strengthening the Czech, namely 13,3 billion Crowns, the reservation of 10 billion for the payment of retirement, the financing of the government bonds of State for 43 billion Crowns and of the loans from the European Investment Bank coming to 1.8 billion Crowns.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum to have named a bear in becomes
The British teacher judged in Sudan to insult to Islam has been condemned on Thursday evening by a court of Khartoum to 15 days of prison and expulsion, has indicated his lawyer.
The British was accused of having let students of 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mohammed to a bear in becomes even that any representation of the prophet of Islam is illicit.
It was punishable by a penalty of whippings.
This British teacher of 54 years according to the high school of Khartoum in Sudan, was arrested on Sunday to it and was accused of endangering Islam and insurrection, under the terms of Article 125 of the Sudanese penal code, following a number of complaints from parents of pupils of the Ministry of Education of Sudan.
History goes back in fact in September, when this teaching asks its pupils, 6 / 7 years, to choose a name for the plush bear the class.
"eight names out of his mouth children, whose Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", relates to the director of the Robert boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chooses Mohamed as preferred first name.
Mohamed is, of course, the name of the prophet and, above all, to name but a very common in Sudan.
The children have carried out a book for the class with the photograph of the bear follows the legend ‘ my name is Mohamed ".
The bear do not carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply that the presentation of the prophet considered to be an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching in the same school in Sudan, has said that he knew well and that it would never have done anything that can be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," it is according to him as a "innocent error."
Opinion shared by many students of the teacher who described as "very attentive to its students" and "which speaks of religion in class".
Let us recall that the first name Mohamed is also the second name more given in Great Britain, it is written in English 14 different ways.
This name often chooses by Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this first name?
They can, for example, to give it to a toy?
It is of course a matter of interpretation.
They are not on Wednesday to reach an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo have completed on Wednesday morning in Baden, in Austria, a sixth and ultimate meeting of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the Statute", has declared the European mediator Wolfgang ischinger, at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "concerned", its American counterpart, frank wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not envisage violence in the immediate future but we enter into a very difficult period," he added, raising that "obvious tensions exist."
At the end of the mediation on 10 December
The role of the troika, which is the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make a last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province filled with 90% of albanophones could become clearer when ischinger, wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander botsane-khartchenko submit their report to the Security Council of the United Nations, here on 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, close to Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the troika has been responsible for a new mediation by the UN, in August last year.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who already have blocked at the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, stress them on a continuation of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains engaged in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", has said botsane-khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration of Kosovo, the West believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina is said to be ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not cut in its favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," has announced the President of the autonomous authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in Baden which have taken place since Monday these "negotiations of the last chance".
Hashim Thaci, former Commander of the rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, part of its regrets.
But it has added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to the murders and deportations."
"domino effect"
The Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated for his part that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the independence of the province.
Belgrade said in particular to fear a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the war of independence of the 1990s.
"for Serbia, he said, that does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision is allocated exclusively to the Security Council, where his Russian ally has a right of veto.
"the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word"
"only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
"these negotiations lasted two years ago.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.
Journalists, Fatmir sedjiu had replied that "the Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word on the Statute", adding that any unilateral declaration of independence from the albanophones do "," in cooperation with the West.

It has taken more than seven hours of work in the space to the astronaut Scott parazynski and his friends of the crew of the international space station (simple percentages) to carry out the spectacular repairing a solar panel torn, essential to the pursuit of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its removal from the modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, tools "fixed" by the astronauts for carrying out the repair.
The problem has appeared on Tuesday while the astronauts had discharged from the shuttle the unit, a big part in charge of welcoming soon the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see supervised).
This unit is a kind of quay of for the.
But it is necessary to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore move a unit of production of electricity by solar panels weighing 17.5 tonnes, already present on the simple percentages, in order to put to post on its final position.
After moving, the crew has started the redeployment of solar panels of the unit which have a scale of 76 metres.
And it is here that one of the signs, which are as accordions, has been damaged on nearly half a metre by a cable which has jammed.
The deployment has been halted, not to harm the panel more.
The astronauts who originally had to carry out an exit of control of the Shuttle, then to go to make up for another solar panel which the rotation system was defective, were forced to devote itself to the damaged sign.
And this is Scott parazynski that has been chosen to go ahead at the end of the 30 metres in length of the arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform repair.
This is one of the best "spacewalker" (space Walker) NASA.
Large, resistant, very skilful, it has developed and the very long arm.
To 46 years, this doctor of training has therefore been responsible "operating" the solar panel "injured".
After precisely to have inspected damage, it has divided the cable and installed sorts of "hitch" on the damaged zone.
It was helped by a second "spacewalker" remained near the lock and, from the inside, by other astronauts which Peggy whitson, the crew.
The tool that he has used, a minicanne hockey wrapped insulating material to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, has been conceived "and" arranged by the astronauts at the edge of the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott parazynski given that the panel is entirely unfolded before making an inventory of the tools and regain the inside of the station.

The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense, on Sunday, at the exit polls: the Russians are going to opt for the party of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration to stability, or even to the authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message today to the voters televised on public channels, already recorded but whose contents are kept secret.
It is as a list of Russia united, the party of which the victory looks to be enormous.
Yesterday, the President has nothing showed in accepting the foreign ambassadors, be satisfied to deliver a new charge against the West, accused of interference - its theme of preference for the country.
"We know the price of a true democracy and wish the honest elections, more transparent and more open, elections without tears," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, one is.
It reports a campaign tainted with pressures.
The Communist leader guennadi ziouganov says that there has never been elections as "dirty, even at the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of demonstrations of last weekend, the ex-world world of failures Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal demonstration, remains prohibited visit according to his lawyer.
"the Russians have kept the mentality of the homosexual"
Behind these legislative without suspense out two issues much more open.
- which will succeed in Putin to the Presidency?
The Official Journal published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin can aspire to a third consecutive mandate.
Yet no successor emerges.
- what role will Putin after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia who choose the government and the President?
At all events, with legislative and presidential election, the power will triumph.
This is a tradition.
"the Russians have kept the mentality of the homosexual, they do not feel masters of their own destiny," considers the sociologist lev goudkov, Director of the independent centre levada.
This kopossov Nikolaï, of the University of state of Saint Petersburg, goes back further: civil society has fallen behind in this country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the formation of the individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the nineties, "Putin again with the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population of much more than this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic wealth, Maria lipman estimates, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "renounce willingly personal responsibility" which they had fixed shown after the break-up of the USSR.
Why to think? "
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (on 85 heads of Russian regions) direct the local lists of Russia united.
The new freedoms imported from the West is often synonymous with chaos, as in the nineties.
The opinion prefers the stability.
In the name of what the Russians not vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara tcherednitchenko, Professor: why think?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change? "

The registers of the concentration camps or of the arrest warrant established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war in a practical purpose: to find the civil prisoners or subject to obligatory work and, if required, to bring a proof of their internment, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Even today in bad arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees treat tens of thousands of individual requests.

Bono agrees to be at the head of the application of the Spanish Socialist Party in Toledo and to chair the conference if they win the elections
The former Prime Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the government and of the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the top of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party in Toledo for the next general election, and to be President of the conference in the case where the Socialists will win the general elections.
So the Secretary General of the organization of the Spanish Socialist Party, Blanco, and Bono himself announced during a press conference after the meeting that took place in the midday to the federal seat of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the executive has justified the offer made to the former Prime Minister because 'it is important to count on the best "in political life and Bono" is among the best ".
Furthermore, it has pointed out that "yes", it seems that the politician channel will be the candidate of the Socialist Group who will chair the conference if the Socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the conference, that the latter has made public on 15 November last its decision not to come to the prochainess general elections and to give up his political career to devote itself to the fight against climate change in the university framework.
The former Prime Minister has recognized that the President of the government has not stopped insisting that it comes back in the vanguard policy since it has abandoned it two years ago.
Furthermore, it has been pointed out that, even if the citizens already know that the economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins elections, his party wanted to announce that who will chair the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If it affects the post, Bono hopes to transform the room in a House of respect and insult or cry "and that" it looks more and more citizens ".
"sometimes it seems so that the only place in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and quietly is the Conference, the President of the government in the Senate in certain occasions has éte interrupted 26 time".
In the same way, it has been words of praise for its current President, Manuel Marín and "its know-how" and it did not want to do as if it has already occupied his post for not to fall, as he has pointed out, in that its opponents could be considered as a domination ".
A climatic propaganda
Given that the movement against climate change subjects to a persecution without mercy as well to the mercy of its predictions that those who gives priority to other political and social battles, it must show an iron coherence.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement that is President of the government as Zapatero and who thinks that this conflict is more important than that of Islamic terrorism, and that even proposes to sign a "new contract for the world".
This approach makes it to explain why the action or inaction, its government have contributed in a decisive way to what Spain is at the top of the European Union in the Kyoto protocols.
Who are the representatives of the sectors, in which it has happened and why his government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided.
Furthermore, it must be made clear to the Spanish which are the measures that it is going to take to slow down climate change.
What businesses will be affected, which practices of the citizens will have to be changed, which individual and collective energy savings will be obliged us to do, what economic consequences that will cause.
That is to say, that are sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there was, and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is a question of being sacrificed and pay.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that it hastened to deny it.
This is to say that it is a matter of saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, which Mr if useful for the election campaigns which does not speak, which does not report and which does not demand, the meetings and inspires the kindness.
Provided that it is limited only to be purely virtual contracting parties and which does not aspire to it as we move into the bicycle or we ourselves with the range.

That is to say, that the feelings that generates the pay of workers monthly depends on what the colleagues win.
The study has been carried out through the magnetic resonance in the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and manager of the group in charge of the images of neurocognition of life & brain Institute, in Germany: "the strongest activation occurred when the participant replied correctly and his companion failed".

The prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years continues relentlessly war criminals of the Balkans for the public prosecutor's office of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is in the Hague.
Its mandate ends at the end of the year and Carla will go away with a bitter taste, because the main representatives of the murder of Srebrenica - in which Muslims died, the Ratko Mladic and the serbobosnio ex-leader Radovan Karadzic, are still in freedom.
Their names are in this list the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel schüpbach takes its title, 'the list of Carla' (2006, not cast exclusively in Spain), with the pace of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss Prosecutor of Belgrade in New York that follows the criminals in flight and put pressure on the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What assurance is it appropriate to me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in view of possible accidents, implies an important expenditure which will depend on various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use that they in fact, among others.
To have a car is the principal.
There are that, escoger El Seguro automóvil adecuado are incluso Más difícil that elegir El modelo of vehículo.
And it is that, to choose the appropriate car insurance, is even more difficult than to choose the model of the vehicle.
The car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise materializes by an insurance policy, which establishes that the company receives the value of bonus granted and in return it becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which is established in taking account of various factors such as age, sex, seniority of driving licence, marital status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the usageque they in fact, among others.
The insurance companies establish their prices according to the statistics, so that the greater the likelihood of an accident is, the more the dimension to pay is high.
It is for this reason that the people of more than 25 years old, and women have to pay lower premiums, since the statistics show that these persones have a lower rate of disasters at their caution.
In the same way, using the census, companies have concluded that the married people tend to have fewer accidents that single drivers.
The use they make of the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore on the likelihood of an accident.
In increasing frequency probability increase.
They are many variables that insurers take into account at the time of the price of the premium.
It is for this, that the driver must study the situation for choosing the car insurance which adapts better to its profile.
We shall display the most significant variables here at the moment to choose one or the other type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insurer, it offers a reasonable price.
The young people of less than 25 years must deal with various drawbacks at the moment to pass a contract with an assurance at an accessible price, as can be weak experience in the control and seniority of driving licences.
Although the ideal to be well assured is an assurance to any risk, others more economic options exist.
The most far-sighted drivers can opt for a comprehensive insurance with frankness, so that they acquire the covers an assurance to any risk, but in a more accessible price.
This form of convention implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the disaster.
"the part of the amount of the disaster that the customer towards will be established according to the value of the premium, which will be more raised the amount will be weak", specifies shines Noguera, the representative in Spain of first Europa, mediator of online insurance.
Another option is the assurance to third enlarged, so that the customer ensures protection to face up to the damage caused to the third, but by for those caused on its own cars.
Furthermore, it would be covered on the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A Council.
If you are minor 25 years to be careful and to avoid accidents as much as possible, since that will affect the premium, being able to reduce the price of insurance in the future.
An improvement is a reduction of the standard rate that the company.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase of the standard rate.
"The allowances and the sanctions will depend on the company and the benefit of this.
If the company has been a good year it will be able to afford to increase premiums, "clarifies Noguera.
Beyond the 25 years it becomes easier for drivers in time to sign a contract with an assurance, since the rate of accidents is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose a comprehensive insurance with frankness.
"normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in the previous after an accident, ensures the director of the European company in Spain and to add that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of control, a time past 'fear of novice'.
However, if the customer is married but has not yet children it is preferable that it negotiates an assurance to any risk, momento that its economic situation for him.
The marriages children are considered by the insurers as being the people with the lowest rate of disasters, because the increases will be weaker.
In this case the best assurance would be an assurance at all with frankness - being able to be 300 Euros), or an assurance to third enlarged from the third year of life of the vehicle when the assured has a high level of improvement.
"they have a more relaxed and they have a greater purchasing power to allow itself the luxury of accepting a quantity of frankness", judge shines Noguera.
For the pensioners an assurance at all with frankness is preferable (being this 150 euro), or a asurance with third widened when the insurer has a high level of improvement.
It must be said that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in view of possible accidents, but also because it represents an important expenditure, it is for that that it is fundamental to study properly the assurance that suits us more according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will seek to gain a point in Milan to arrive at the rounds of final

A defeat of the team of Gordon strachan could be sufficient to rank if the Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on that basis with nine points games returns to the Ukrainians, which have lost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who have won () in the other direct duel.
So, will try to poison the evening to the Scottish, which have good hope to be classified as the eighth of final for the second time in the Champions League, after having been defeated in the latest edition by a goal of kaka during continuations (1-0).
While awaiting the victory of the 'rossoneri' triumph would only to shakhtar, in the case where the Celtic lose, to be classified as rounds finale to be able to continue the Champions League of UEFA.

The new business of gas from Russia and the Ukraine throws the alarm.
A dispute on the price of gas ferments between Ukraine and Russia, for example, the risks of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
The majority of the Russian gas exports to the European Union (E.U.) are by gas pipelines, and every canal is overseen.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase the taxes of transit to Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two, had caused a reduction of supplies to the countries of the E.U.
The last argument between Kiev and Moscow happens after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom company of monopoly of ownership of Russia is supplying gas, have tried in vain to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas provided to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom has declared that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine, given that it has agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas coming from Turkmenistan.
The analysts have declared that it would include for Ukraine, an increase of 40% of the costs of imports originating from Gazprom.

The climate of Venus could be the future of the earth.
The scientists have yesterday said that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live.
The data coming from the European vessel in orbit showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the earth, contrary to what we thought beforehand.
Venus is the planet more closely to the land.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits Venus, well that is closer to the sun.
The scientists believe now that there are billions of years, Venus could have had conditions similar to those of the earth, and could even have been living.
But the greenhouse effect due to the carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion in solar expulsions at a slower rotation Venus has led to a different kind of development.
Today the planet is deprived of water, devastated by hurricanes and storms of lightning and has a surface temperature warm enough to melt lead.
The findings of come express, the of the European Space Agency, which has studied the planet for one year, offers a sad vision of the future potential of the earth due to the disastrous effects of climate changes.
The teacher of the Department of physical appearance of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of the come express, said: "we begin to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of the earth, although planets in them even are virtually similar.
"our new data enable us to establish a scenario according to which there are billions of years, Venus originally would have been the same as the earth, can be even with a living space.

Still open to all
Mitt romney said not to be up to the task, as candidate for the Presidency, to answer the questions of a fellow of snow.
In spite of this, the Republican candidates for the Presidency finally agreed to take part in the debate you tube, during which many ordinary voters having done their questions, subject to the candidates.
On Wednesday evening 28 November, no questions asked was also ridiculous that one solution of another debate you tube, when a fellow of snow has asked the Democrats their position in relation to the global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have reflected the conditions of the republican party, candidate for the next elections.
One does not know on what criteria, the producers of CNN, who has sponsored the debate, have chosen the videos of you tube to show the candidates candidates.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest approaching a theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the subjects the strong for the Republicans.
CNN has asked some voters to telephone when they would hear agreeable things: the control concerned increases approval when the candidates expressed in a crude.
The hardest exchange and the longer the party was between rudy Giuliani, leader of the Front national, and Mr contrite which is at the head of the important elections of the iowa and new Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that it was accommodating about illegal immigration during his mandate of mayor of New York.
It has attacked Mr contrite, showing the former governor of Massachusetts, to use clandestine immigrants with him.
The two fighters have become particularly fierce when they asked them if they would be willing to promote a "amnésia" (offering to clandestine a statute and the possibility of becoming citizen).
Minor candidates as Duncan hunter, a delegate delegate, Tom tancredo, one of Colorado, have managed to further into this subject.
None of them have the possibility of being elected, but both of them in the race, thanks to the fact that they have begun to fight immigration before and a more incisive than the others.
Generally speaking, the candidates, at least concerning immigration, have the same opinions: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for the immigrants.
This subject, combined with the anxiety caused in particular by the business of toxic toys produced in China, or other fears to the external world, support the Republicans to forget, or to minimize the divisions between the libertarians and the conservative Catholics.
But the debate has become particularly embarrassing when other matters have been raised.
Mr Giuliani was asked why it had previously supported the campaign for the control of arms.
John McCain and Mr contrite discussed to know if put water in the nose should be regarded as a torture.
One of the speakers asked if the candidates believed in its entirety, with the contents of the Bible.
This has led Mr Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his book, even if it is not on believing in the history of Jonas and whale.
Another speaker has asked Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
We did not expect to see Mike huckabee, - in pole position in iowa during a recent election, thanks to its Christian conservatism longstanding - to declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When they insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favour, it has started to laugh and has declared that Jesus is too smart to present themselves to the elections.
The human race is open to all.
The rise of Mr huckabee in iowa coincides with the recent extraordinary subsidy research carried out by the libertarian Ron Paul, and whistles during the debates on Wednesday.
These two there are nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protected from the party do not manage to come to an agreement to decide which is the more known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a unified the party in time and in a convincing thanks to a message of success on the American size approaching so the leaders.
This time, the party is divided, and the result is far from clear.
The pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation does not change.
In view of the tendency of the British scandals, this is not particularly profitable.
Not sold decorations, nor bills of Parisian hotel of politicians, not sucked up extra sucked.
But this is only a revelation certifies that a rich businessman would have hidden for four years, under false names, its contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £$(1.3m), that the party would not have declared: a new battle which Gordon Brown would be well spent.
Two months ago, Prime Minister has backtracked in his election project, insulting the British intelligence stupidly proclaiming that the opinion polls have not influenced its decision, and that he hoped to the contrary, to give a dense and efficient government.
On the contrary, such vince brilliant LEADER, the Liberal Democrat, has declared that the terrible Mr Brown has transformed to Mr bean.
The purchase of northern rock, a bank in difficulty at the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a fault of the directives and a poor judgement in case of emergency.
The inadequate proposals in favour of shifting the tax code have caused a coalition of the industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million data on the part of the authorities of the taxes, has been an administrative blunder.
A trio of generals in retirement launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditure: they have declared that to be a Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time employment.
At the present time, the distrust squint from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Secretary of the Labour Party (and its former head of vigilance) have made that they have had to resign.
Nothing that means that Mr Brown itself leads inevitably to go out.
However the governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to control.
The people do not like the politicians, and do not have confidence in them, but in general leave their doubts quotation at the time that a new government is in power.
It seems obvious that a Prime Minister can improve things, or even to control for a long time, in that it risks suspension: the public administration does not work any more; the offices of the Ministers assessment; the research of the bad news stories; and the government is on the defensive and without any more objective.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult, because in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot be praised to be a beginning.
Although it would wish Tony Blair, it has really been his superior lieutenant.
The problems relating to the northern rock and the data of taxes, for example, are linked to decisions of Mr Brown when it was Chancellor of the British treasury.
And even if it is not directly involved in the misfortunes of Blair, such long investigation on the funds of the party "cash for the Members of the House of Lords," the voters may think otherwise.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is not so tragic that it looks like.
The blunders are not so monstrous as the Members on the left of the Tories do believe.
As Mr bean, there is no victim or fraud.
And the remedy, although painful, could be to make real the Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown, always in favour of a reliable and slightly violent.
The new scandal in the settlements policy is a good example.
Mr Abrahams, a very particular character, which sees its donations to charity, has declared that it does not wish for any public recognition of its benevolence.
It can have its opinion, but this is not to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of wholesale trades of the politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: the public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who govern the country.
Mr Watt, who has declared to be in the course of the agendas of Mr Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, by consequence will be questioned, besides that jon mendlesohn, the representative of the collections of subsidies which had talked about the dubious settlements in October.
But even here Mr Brown is not involved: nothing suggests that it knows about these steps, even if the majority of the payments carried out have been made to the following its entry to the government in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister has made half.
It quickly condemned the legislative fault of his party, but it did not draw attention to the fact that the power of decision rests on a knack that it well, to make use of a committee of inquiry on this subject from a bishop in retirement and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been scorned, it falls within the police force.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr Brown must make, such as to find a permanent President of the independent committee of the standards of public life, without leader for six months, and to prepare a good reform on the financial, political parties.
That would make the Labour Party, in a time of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such Mr Brown.
But it should face certain facts in favour.
The party of the Conservative now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to recover the voters, and the only way to obtain a victory is demonstrating an irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Frauds of cards.
The crisis of mortgages contaminate the American market of credit cards?
When there is the blood in water, it is normal to see fins, whirl around.
Now that the US housing market runs through a critical phase, the predatory aim to the American market of credit cards.
The analysts from goldman Sachs, think that the losses linked to the credit cards could reach $99 billion if the contagion stretches of mortgages in other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in rates of expenses and insolvency, what measures the parts of the assessment or which are, more than 30 days afterwards.
Hsbc announced last month that it has taken $1.4 billion in its appropriations to the consumer, in part because of the weakness of the holders of cards.
It is still too early to panic.
The expenses and are still moderate.
According to moody, a tax agency, the rate of insolvency of 3.89% of the troixième term is inferior almost a point in relation to its historical average.
The deterioration of the rates is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in the law in 2005 in the United States, concerning the personal bankruptcy has caused an abrupt fall of the files of bankruptcy, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of files (and therefore of rates of insolvency) could increase even if the conditions of loans were to get worse.
The industry announced in addition to the fixed rates of payment, which highlight the sum of monthly debt that consumers need to regulate.
And the confidence in the sureté of the capital of credit cards is strong enough, despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured finance.
Dennis moroney of towergroup, a society of research, predicted that the volume of emission for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct links of infection amongst the crisis of mortgages and the market of credit cards indeed exist: the consumers would prefer to increase their debts now that equitable real loans have disappeared.
But the transmitters of cards pay more attention to the flow of cash rather than to the value of the heritage, and therefore the fall in the prices of the property has inevitably led to a change in the credibility of the borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to the transmitters of titles of credit.
The premiums to the consumers for the payment of mortgages fall if ownership costs less than the value of the loan, by consequence, the debt by credit card would become a priority to pay the whole again.
The transmitters of cards are able to respond much more rapidly than the ones and with more flexibility in such conditions of crisis, because they can change the interest rates or alter the limits of rédit.
It should in theory to reduce the risk of having a quick return of actions.
"We are not going to wake up one morning and to re-examine all the loans has declared Gary perlin, the director of one capital.
If a financial disaster of the market of credit cards is unlikely, there is a strong risk of having a consequent decrease.
If the lower prices of real estate and shrinkage in the credit market bring us to the recession, the industry will have to face a macabre future.
Pay attention to the fins well.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who had to go to manifest their roles in relation to a fraud committed by the previous financial director of Enron, Mr Andrew fastow, have changed their declaration, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David bermingham, Giles darby and Gary mulgrew were initially declared innocent of seven charges for presumed collusive fraud in 2000, made by fastow in a secret financial fraud in order to grow rich in spite of their employees.
They should be presented to the Court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by the American judge Ewing werlein jr, they are all found guilty of having made a fraud.
The three former frameworks of Greenwich natwest, a subsidiary of the group plc of the Royal bank of Scotland, became famous everywhere in the United Kingdom because of the extradition procedures which have lasted two years ago.
In the United States, their case is still an outstanding question for this inquiry launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges that were brought in 2002, have made clear to fastow that it was the subject of the investigation of the government in the collapse of Enron.
The charges against the bankers, called the "three of natwest" claim to have come in Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael kopper.
Natwest Greenwich has invested in a subsidiary of a partner of Enron controlled by fastow, which was the director of many fraudulent, who has helped it to the procedures of bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank had considered its interest for the subsidiary as any, but in fact the three British men already its value.
A company controlled by kopper bought the interest of the Bank of the subsidiary to £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to kopper as interest in this society.
According to the accused, fastow would have announced to Enron that society of energy was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich natwest for its actions in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, fastow and others again.
According to the charges, the bankers had obtained $7.3 while fastow, kopper and others would have gained $12.3 million.
In January 2004, fastow pleaded guilty for its active role in both conspiracies in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested after three months.
Fastow has suffered a six years imprisonment in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for three years and a month in a prison in texarkana.
The three British have been released following the payment of a guarantee of $each, which oblige them to live in the United States during the process.
Enron, before seventh largest national society, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting, could no longer hide his billion debt or even to propose its speculations can be profitable.
The collapse has caused thousands of redundancies, more than $60 billion of loss of value in the market, and more than $2 billion loss for the pension schemes.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth lay and the former President general Jeffrey skilling have been condemned last year, for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling has been sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against lay for conspiracy, fraud and other offences have been empty because of his death due to a heart attack last year.

The pressures on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject subsequent funds in the stock markets causing tension of credit, the fact that the rate of loans sorting monthly "libor" the British banks, have caused their higher growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong increase for the 12 November.
Britain faces a call to the sentence in relation to the criticisms of owais Shah and who bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, such a difficult as the other.
That will be the drummer N ° 6 for Britain to kandy this end, owais Shah or who?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first test on Sri Lanka, which will make the decision?
The second question is important because David graveney, the President of the sélectionneurs which was unusually there to help Peter moores, Leader and coach, Michael Vaughan, the captain, to take its decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the Director General of the England, begins to fill the application forms for becoming a national, at least part time.
The one that will not manage to take away the N ° 6 will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport is also.
It is never easy to overcome this, which allows a person to arrive at the top of its occupation for another will never happen in addition to the lower level, sometimes by lack of opportunity more than by lack of skill.
It is not only the cricket that the selection is difficult, because in the end, the sentence is subjective.
Is the right moment to emerge?
Is it just in relation to the Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, to choose between John edwards or tubby "tubby?"; both, new frameworks having acquired good certificates, professionals, should be promoted, but there is room for a single one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketeur unless we grant him at least a chance?
The figures are important in the decisions, but also the opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketeur must catch the eye of the captain, at the same time it must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the one day.
But to capture the eyes of the sélecteurs much more complicated.
Much better made last season, for example, James Anderson which seemed certain play the first test, even if Stephen harmison broke out in the middle of the form and continued in itself to be used.
Anderson took 32 first-rate doors on 33 turns to gain a place.
Chris tremlett took that 29 to the same average, but both of them have already lived their time of glory in the greatest level and hope to offer again.
If that will be Shah or bopara will at that stage, it is only a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build the career of a man, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth has played in each test and has succeeded well in the first, with five doors and 40 turns, but this was Paul collingwood, which also fought to emerge, who has managed to become the essential of test, and that, despite the fact that its double hundred marked against Australia in Australia can still be under estimated.
The likelihood is that graveney, Vaughan, and moores, after another debate after today's session at the stage, will follow their conservative instincts and will support the greatest experience of Shah against the exuberance of the young person.
Both of them have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, its bright and considerable beginning in innings of the test of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class against six to bopara, which in 22 years is seven years younger, and his excellent classification at the launch.
But Shah fact that ten rounds in its two in May on the Caribbean during the Lord test, the city of middlesex player, and that, to the immediate rejection by the sélectionneurs when Vaughan again form, claimed its place for the next game, seems to have upset his so evident in Bombay.
In contrast to him, the player of Essex is full of joy of life.
Nothing is afraid of a land of cricket and it has exaggerated when he recently collapsed on a 4x4 during a presentation of Volkswagen, sponsor of England.
It is reported that light injuries, has been shocked, even if the first thing that he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor on) and call Alastair Cook, its Member who looked at a distance, to ask him 's "he had seen that?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, its running appearance allows him to make the services which go to him, and he beats with confidence and professionnalité.
To choose the right man is one thing, to choose the right moment is another.
Is this can be the art of the selection?
I would be advantageous to give a chance to bopara, which does not mean that the Shah should not apply if, like the tea leaves suggest to him that this is bound to this end.
The bus bring back the people at work, and to fight against Al Qaeda.
The first bus full of refugees coming from Syria is able to yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or renewals of visa, or others still hope that the city found normality.
Some are back to fight against the activists who moved away from them.
The station of bus, even before the arrival of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses of official government, the final was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I have decided to go to Syria after they kill many doctors in baghdas" declared Sabah qubaisi, a doctor.
"I am back today because I have seen on the television and read in the newspapers, what has happened to baghdâd and saw that the city is more sure now.
"they say that the army makes no more crimes!" he said, referring to the militia of the ecclesiastical militant who has imposed its men to move away for the time being.
Qassim Al atwani, a teacher of 38 years of the area of amariyah dominated by the Sunni, is back with her two children, because it could not renew its aim and for the Syrian regime prevents the Iraqis to work.
Its neighbours with amariyah called to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, has helped to drive out Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited to come back.
One of the newcomers of Jordan is the leader of a tribe Sunni, Shia, who has had to leave their homes in the north of baghdâd because of an attack in the grenade after that it encourages the citizens to rebel against Al Qaeda.
But he had to return to fight.
Two days ago, some of my friends have called me and said to have put in place a militia anti in sleikh, and that they needed to me and my boys. "
This is why I return "today" sabaah obeidi, 62.
Many people say have attracted by the growing capital for the American troops have happened, and with a view to the continuous training of "groups of citizens involved" well armed and working with the American soldiers to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say have been forced to return because of the problem of visa and the decline of the capital of, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have escapes the past years.
Salaam al-samarrai, 51 years, father of three children, has expressed the distrust felt by all about visas for exiles that nouri al-Maliki, the Prime Minister, who would have asked the government to limit to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people would have run away from the country because of the sectarian companies of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki comes to Syria and encourages the government to do more to give visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq" has declared the pensioner Sunni.
"I cannot trust in a government which supports the criminals who burned my House when I am part".
The fall of violence in part can be explained by the fact that have been driven out of the areas of Shia and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
They fear that a sudden flow of refugees does not increase again sectarian tensions and to bring back the fighting.
Small Saarland, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in the matter of training, and shines even by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a field that a deficit on the of the, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I exliqué yesterday for the 50th time in a not -, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by, posts for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a large role in the system of training of Saarland, a system that is placed in the fifth monitor of the training of the Institute of the German economy of Cologne.
Thus, by tradition, schools would cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in sarrebruck by the French.
So far, the students have the possibility of ending their studies by a double, or even a triple certificate.
The well high 15.6 percent of foreign students.
The Saar led by elsewhere too, the children of the country to the higher schools in number higher than the average - many of them without a certificate of gymnasium.
"in Saarland, they use the system of vocational training", known as plünnecke, expert in training at iw.
More than a young person on five gets its way of studies in a vocational school, so the Saar is more than seven points above the national average.
As the possibilities of combination of a professional and academic are relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the panel of double programme is the second best of Germany.
In spite of a practical training and an increasing demand, the number of diplomés engineering has nevertheless fell by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education of the forced the higher schools to a marketing campaign in matters of the engineer.
"after the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in the general schools", known as a spokesman of the Ministry of Education.
So the Government has introduced in all the federated state of the tests of comparison.
So that the children begin earlier to learn, the last year of crêche is free of law - a model that meanwhile other federated States also copy.
Only of future comparative will show whether the performances improve in a sustainable manner.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the quota of students to risk has been reduced from 29 to 20%.
On the whole, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federated States.
The ones put through better.
And to the great frustration of of the, the knowledge in foreign languages are not measured by the PISA studies - one might otherwise gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbour is compulsory in the secondary schools - even if the of the are not French.
Rule watches.
In Venezuela, watches will soon make it than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will rise the half an hour in the country.
Meanwhile Chavez becomes a caricature in Spain.
As the Official Journal of Venezuela communicated, due to a new law, watches will be regulated at least four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the country obtains a schedule which does not exist in any other State of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified its position, inter alia by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
Furthermore, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the suspension of relations with the country, Colombia, owing to a matter of hostages.
The nationalist left announced that as long as the Conservative Alvaro Uribe would remain President of Colombia, it does not maintain relations or with the head of state, nor with the Colombian Government.
"I cannot, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez that a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by way of referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly its power in the country.
The element of this dispute Uribe was the decision to withdraw Chávez the mandate for negotiations in connection with the release of hostages with the rebels Marxists in Colombia.
Uribe "would spat at face" Venezuela with this decision, had been Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain also Chávez is on everyone's lips.
A new ring of mobile phone fact rage in the country: "por no callas you" (why you do not) is the sentence that already more than half a million people on the Internet.
It has been pronounced by the King of Spain Juan Carlos who, at the most recent summit ibéro-américain, was irritated by the constant questioning of the left populists and who said to him to be silent.
A reduction in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a forecast, a true of wage earners threatens the Germans this year.
Experts have named all kinds of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Foundation, the employees should expect a real reduction in 2007 on their card to pay compared to the previous year.
"The mistake comes back to the development of the low wages, to the increase of the value added tax and the rises in the prices of foodstuffs and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for macroeconomics and research on the situation, to the newspaper 'Bild ".
New expenses can also intervene in the matter of unemployment for the employee.
The Minister of Finance peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper 'Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung' that the fall of the unemployment of 3.3% for the new year was of course correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However the national agency does not have the right to be in trouble to ask the Federation of credits or financial assistance, according to the words of the SPD politician of.
They knew Tuesday that the explosion in the prices of foodstuffs and hydrocarbons had led to the rate of inflation at its highest level since 13 years.
On the whole, prices have risen to 3.0% from one year to the next.
Venus is the infernal of the earth.
In spite of its atmosphere hostile to the life, Venus looks more like the earth that what they believed until now: the European space "come express" discovered lightning in the atmosphere and of the wind in the Poles, similar to those which appear in the winter on earth.
For almost three decades, the scientists assume that there are flashes on Venus.
The European "come express" has now brought the proof - it has detected electromagnetic waves in the limit of the atmosphere: flashes on Venus burst at a height of around 56 kilometres of all in all, brings back Christopher de the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific journal "nature".
According to the famous theory of the cyprine, lightning would have revealed the life on earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans which have led to the formation of amino acids, stone of the way of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life there has been, it must have been a very old date of history ', explains Solomon" Carnegie institution "in Washington.
It should be today hardly living things to the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is approximately one hundred times more dense that on earth, it is sometimes temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus is perhaps the infernal of the earth, but it remains a twin", said russel.
Why Venus, which looks so much to the land masses and dimensions, has been struck an evolution so different, is the fundamental question of the mission.
The departure of "come express" in November 2005 was an important step in the research, since no more probe was bound to the exploration of this planet since the eighties ten.
In the opinion of the scientists, the most recent research results that have now been introduced in several articles of "nature" do not point out not only the oddity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the mutual interests with the earth from our neighbouring are more than assumed in the first place.
So the researchers have found, in addition to the wind known to the North Pole, a pole of clouds in the South, which is even more quickly.
The phenomenon of the drafts in the land hemispheres in winter, wrote a team of researchers around Giuseppe piccioni of Istituto Di spaziale e Italian.
The second of the solar has almost the same mass that the earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 measure the mileage, almost as great.
The qualified star of the evening or the morning revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
It is however much more slowly on itself: a hard day 243 days land.
Although Venus, with temperatures in the surface of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, recalls the earth, the scientists assume that both were formed in similar conditions.
On the two, the water is up and remained on the ground in the form of oceans, but got lost in the space on Venus.
And while the carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in the form of carbonate, it is on Venus the greater part of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends the meeting of Merkel with the Dalaï Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler requires the end of the parties to the dispute about the reception of the Dalaï Lama to the Ministry of Justice.
In an indirect way, he criticized the SPD because of the attacks against the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Köhler worries about the appearance of Germany and all the great coalition to close the quarrel about the reception of the Dalaï Lama.
"We must not present in the outside world a divided nation on this question," said Köhler in Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalaï Lama by the Chancellor Merkel (CDU) in September.
"the human rights are a universal validity, even if I have respect for the differences between cultures" Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should keep a sensitive balance in the field of foreign policy, underlined the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against the reproaches according to which it would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not taken its distance from the policy only of one China.
"China also knows," said Köhler.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs steimeier (SDP) indirectly had made known its dissatisfaction regarding the reception of the Dalaï Lama and had been attacked for that apart from the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier was complained in particular of the "policy front" of the CDU in the field of foreign policy.
After the reception of the Dalaï Lama to the Ministry of Justice, virulent were felt in the reports.
So the Chinese Government did not put off the German Finance Minister peer Steinbrück (SDP), but according to the news of the Spiegel, also froze the dialogue said strategy of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao demands consequently Chancellor Angela Merkel of reconnaitre that the reception of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refuses to that European politicians accept the spiritual leader of Tibet in its official duties, supported Wen Jiabao so the Chinese position.
The words and deeds of the Dalaï Lama would show that it tries to separate from China, Tibet and other Tibetans, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Street battles with the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against the riots as those of France.
Everything must be implemented so that the social discontent in Germany does not burst in the streets by violence, has required the German Interior Minister.
The barricades that burn, demonstrators who draw on the police with hunting guns: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU fears a similar evolution in Germany.
We must see to it that an explosive social contitue not also to us and is defused by violence.
We must take this seriously ", said to the 'Neue press" appeared in Hanover.
All young people do not manage to cope with the rapid transformation of the social reality.
The Federation, the federated states and villages already worked firmly to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
That would not only the integration of immigrants.
"summits of integration at conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it is still too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there has not sociological problems or from the point of view of the planning as in France.
In the Paris of the North, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater efforts of integration on the part of the German Government, this is what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan kolat.
Taking into account the riots in France, kolat warned against the "effects of imitation."
The situation in Germany would certainly not so explosive as in France.
But nevertheless it would remain a need to act.
Kolat puts the emphasis on the fact that the quota of unemployed with young people below 25 years resulting from the immigration would be higher than the average.
It is above all to ensure more places the training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give to the young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that a social control in families more took place in Germany, in France.
A lot of young people coming from the immigration do not want in addition to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat motivated: "but we must really be prudent."
It should be "quickly to give young people a chance to take part in the work and the training".
In the meantime, in the Parisian suburb of villiers-the-beautiful, all remained very quiet during the night.
Unity of police were in place, a helicopter flew across the area with the spotlight.
The authorities in post were part of three arrests as few burned cars and dustbins.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1000 security forces to ensure peace.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, announced the Minister of the Interior Michelle alliot-marie, after a suburb visit.
In the night of Tuesday, nearly 80 police officers have been injured during the riots in villiers-le-bel.
In the next night, the confusion overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots burst after a traffic accident in which two young people had died on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the floor, the police force is not responsible for the death of the young.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The utopian entrance Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the Fund - and that there is nothing more to wait for it.
In what country does this Chancellor exactly?
After his distressing intervention in the general debate of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it is necessary to say: no one here - not in the countries that should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach to concentrate too much on the policy has been rejected by Angela Merkel of a hard and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, she said, and has just shown by there that it does not want to understand what the criticisms.
In Parliament, it has made visible of to what extent this criticism was correct.
There was no concrete interest or hardly feelings for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela came as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, which runs away in the foreign policy and that even there remains in the approximation.
For example, the protection of the climate: in this field, it is still very pleased and again on the agreements with heiligendam, but does not say how the objectives on the climate will be achieved in our country.
The same, the praise of himself to have as little modesty, the leader of the CDU would still have refused it two years ago.
Now she herself to all made formulas, that growth touch people.
By there it destroys its image as a pragmatist, which resolves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the empire of Angela cloud, the problems of domestic policy are a marginal.
Poverty among children and the concerns of the workers to low wages?
It remains a few additional sentences for it.
In this matter is revealing the number of times when it makes lapses when it is a matter of family benefits.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to pronounce a sentence in half.
She staggers some ground, from the moment when this becomes concrete.
The attack branch
In the debate of youtube candidates Republicans in the presidential election, the two favorites and mitt romney devoted to a hard battle offensive - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension erupts already candidates in the first place.
It would have made in New York a "shelter for the aliens", reproaches his opponent rudy Giuliani.
This on its side by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own House was a haven for aliens" replies and reproaches the former governor of the massachussetts have used the immigrants without papers.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican basis has moreover not have official, eight candidates for the presidency will use the debate on CNN above all to discredit their opponents.
The amateur films of 30 seconds that the users of the Internet have sent via youtube are scarcely more than souffleurs.
"It is with this kind of isolationism that we have left to Hitler come to power", John McCain to its candidate Ron Paul, which is the only one in the round to claim an immediate withdrawal of Iraq.
Contrite also makes the lesson vigorously by the veterans of Vietnam, when it refuses to condemn as a torture of what they call "waterboarding", a method of interrogation where the drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the country go meanwhile beyond the war in Iraq and the debate on torture sees in the reactions of the town of St Petersburg in Florida.
That the conservative values are rented or that the future increases in taxes are refused, the applause breaks in the studio.
It is there that reveal once again where resident the weaknesses of the two favourites.
"I made a mistake in this era", explains apologetic and present his apologies to the Foundation and the public televised in 1994 to have again been a supporter of abortion.
Giuliani instead going on in a noose when they ask him for his opinion on interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf rule for the first time in office.
One day after its withdrawal as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the man of power Musharraf has been invested as President.
Thus eight years of domination by the army to finish.
The President of Pakistan pervez Musharraf has been invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
The television broadcast live the ceremony in the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf has sworn to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
Wednesday it had passed on his load of commander-in-chief of the armed forces in his intimate ashfaq kiyani and are thus forced to international pressure, in particular that of the United States.
Eight years after the seizure of power by a putsch without bloodshed, the former general rule now for the first time as a Head of State.
By this withdrawal of the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf was filled the principal of the opposition and the West.
Another central is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf was issued on 3 November.
Already shortly after his nomination Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to the public prosecutor malik Muhammad qayyum, and so will fill a requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, that Musharraf was held after the introduction of the state of emergency with lawyers of its ranks, was rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of head of state on 6 October.
Meanwhile five soldiers were killed in the region of the North in Waziristan tribal North in an attack on a military convoy, and four others wounded.
According to the indications of the spokesman of the army, a bomb exploded in a street near the border of Afghanistan.
The fathers of the krautrock make their return.
The supergroupes of Germany in the seventies: the three Members of the group have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return have appeared recording of their great success "live 1974".
Already at this time, they were much more known abroad.
The feeling envisaged happens afterwards in the form of three Messrs announced at the displays of the night.
Each has its small limps in front of him, his cable and above all its buttons.
Dieter moebius, 63 years, throne at the environment in a white shirt as snow.
It is thrown to the left of Michael rother, young person and in possession of a computer and a guitar.
With the right, observed by all the Studio, hans-joachim Joachim, 73, bends on his console.
Each contributes to noise, inter alia, even one.
And sometimes it is added through to a piece of traditional music.
It does not seem too moreover not disturb the Messrs themselves.
The fact that the group is once again secured some stir among the amateurs krautrock.
They have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name reasons in the collective memory of the POP, but in any case so lasting way so that this group is also painfully for 32 years.
But why would not German also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
So much more than what is called "krautrock misleadingly" has always more pleased in Britain and America than in the countries of origin.
Lorque the music industry has awarded price in 2003 echo to the survivors of the Group of Cologne can for their work, one has seen in the room German pop faces.
While the red hot Chile also have thanked the groups Düsseldorf and neu! in the praise, astonishment had more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael rother jumped on the scene of red hot Chile, as an old friend.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transformation into the unknown is the one and only.
The memory of this fact déja taken by harmonized, because the trio existed only two years and that during this period, the power of the impact that is felt was much weaker than what it has been allocated by the further by others.
Moebius and Joachim had already played with the artist Conrad schnitzler under the name of very promising cluster.
They played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the Church, for financial reasons.
Rother had fixed in kraftwerk and was finally made a name as guitarist with neu!, who was at the time, perhaps the most radical German group.
In 1973, rother followed the musicians of cluster nevertheless in exile in the fôrets of weserbergland.
There, in a previous farm of weser, a decline of the 16th century, they have lived as members of communities from the city.
Less ideological than in the Community kommune "i", where Joachim had the right to make torment as.
Rather an artistic existence in the way of spitzweg.
So-called was in the dustbin a flag of the society harmonia ottenstein and also a name for the art.
A lot harmonized far from it.
The first album was called "musik von harmonized", and the following "of luxury".
Because as serene and moderate that sounded music, the Group of misery suffered material.
The harvest did not serve to him alone in search of itself.
The CD "live 1974" which has just appeared has been recorded in concert with griessem in front of a public record of nearly 50 heads, as somebody believes to be remembered.
Emitted at this time the wish to force harmonized to train from time to time.
It was for Joachim and moebius an immoral.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the spheres of and assured its existence with albums as "flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster itself in the eighties and for more success than harmonized has ever had.
We must live in one of the griessem Herbert grönemeyer.
Its label has set itself the aim of keeping the krautrock as inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Joachim.
The physical resurrection takes place in the House of the cultures of the world in Berlin.
Subsidized publicly, within the framework of the festival.
Julian cope is there, the British, old and author of paperback "krautrock sampler".
There is also the inventor of the loveparade, Dr..
By which the whole of the margin of fluctuation of the influence of the krautrock be surrounded with regard to the future pop music.
The place left vacant by the group will be filled by harmonized.
The sentence of Brian eno planes in the room in the middle of the unique sounds: "the only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos which show the producers with harmonized in the part of the farm.
The other photographs in black and white tools wired in bazaar serve to the formation of the legend.
Before, the three veterans are again addressed to improvise.
But more in sticking to the microphones organ and the battery, to get to the instruments sounds thanks to the instruments to built effects himself.
Today, the electronic music looks to the electronic music.
In the three great meticulous of technology.
With that even the society of the House will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara morgenstern, one cough and whisper under the cloud of sound, and one sings to a pretty time "aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It is not a matter of rock.
The roots have been sought in the blues than in the music conservatories (can), in technologies (kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (cluster).
Whoever shouts' 68 "is not completely wrong, and also harmonized does not let Russia now more by that from now on.
But what is the more than one will be covered thoroughly on the scene.
Where does the music and where it finishes?
It can get on the nerves of someone (?) or grant of moments of great joy.
Richard gere is simply not enough cynical.
With "the party" and "fatal peace", two new films approach of the war in the Balkans.
But the two do not convince.
That is the rest of too much on action and on exchanges of senseless shooting or on the contrary they are too crying.
Here, even Richard gere in "the party" cannot help.
The good news first: of course the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic always hide in the mountains of the Balkans, but it is precisely here, in the hinterland of the war in Bosnia, that the actor Richard gere is then met.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because too many roles and futils in films to feelings for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism robbed the desire to show itself.
Today Richard gere suddenly is the most important argument to look at when even "the party" - while the hunter becomes the hunt (why the films today must be so long and confused that collective agreements of drivers of engines?)
It delivers a splendid presentation full of winks: basically, its character to defer war Simon hunt is what gere could have become, if the destiny and the film industry were not also benevolent: a man who has its best moments for long behind it, but that, even as a monument in ruins in decline, has however been visible in its former charm.
But in spite of this, "the party" continues together with the German production "fatal peace", which also goes out this week, the endless continuation of films failed on the war in the Balkans.
"fatal peace" they can do so quickly the process: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian topol, Max riemelt), which would save a Serbian one of the Kosovars, in which one of the two grave still promptly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not presented for once as the only cause of all the evils, this also flat that a film is lost far too quickly in action and exchanges of senseless shooting.
This is a kind of "alarm for Cobra 11" without motorway but with a war in place.
On the contrary, they can examine in the perfect example of "the party", why basically there has never been a good film on the war in the Balkans.
The history of the three American reporters of war, that condition to trace the high war criminal "the fox", could have become, with another director and another scriptwriter (both at the same time Richard shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are alike in a remarkable: both males go in small team in the forest, to achieve something that the soldiers cannot do and for the two male, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "the party" is that they simply do not let Simon hunt be the cynical deserted endowed with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must allocate him moreover a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered by the following.
Then "the party" is definitely wrong, while the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated procedure, guaranteeing that NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of premiums in the world have not succeeded in five years: to catch the criminal war and to allow for a fair revenge in Bosnian Muslims.
This is so poor that they should refer to the International Court of the Hague of crime against the film logic.
In this case, the film has a human too deep preoccupation.
It wants to report that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he accused the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally agreement) not lead the hunting of a rather intensive because of secret political agreements.
But the well-meaning and it is this so similar time that a famous poême of Brecht comes to the idea.
That speaks of a wooden mask a demon Asian on the table poête: "compassionate, I see the veins of the inflated, clearly: as it is to be malicious."
Films such as "the party" have exactly such heads, but that insinuate to what extent it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films on the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it has been brought in this paper that all the films on Iraq were large failures.
We can add: there has ever been good films on South Africa.
What is worth every time: when a star leads towards a home of crisis or on a minefield, it leaves then something like Patricia arquette Rangoon "with", "jenseits to go grenzen with Angelina" or "blutdiamanten" with Leonardo dicaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
At all events, the decades always passed before Hollywood can make a good film on the Holocaust with "the list of Schindler".
Certain films must still mature - those who are today classical works on Vietnam, "the hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "metal jackett" have in any case been unanimously in their time as leaders of work.
But perhaps know we now also simply too much on conflicts of the world, where each massacre comes on line on two screens at the same time to the House,
And this delighted to the lack of scruples which they need to tell Nice stories.
"to be or not to be" or "the dictator" are in fact become as good as because lubtisch and Chaplin still did not know to what extent the Nazi regime really prevailed.
Perhaps that it does not want to be good when one wants to do good.
Perhaps it is necessary to have regard to sarcastic artistic and left behind of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When one has questioned on the parallel between its historical novel "dictionary of lemprière" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "that is due to the fact that certain things that do not change".
"the big cities will always be awfully dangerous, men will always be slaughtered in a terrifying and the war in Yugoslavia.
Von beust crop criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The decline of the Mayor of with the candidature of Hamburg for Summer Olympic Games ran up in politics and the economy to virulent criticisms.
Many people want to continue to fight for the Games to the edge of the water.
But von beust calls the realism in the evaluation of the chances.
The main manager of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, Hans schmidt-trenz, represented on Wednesday a abandonment as being "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed all the forces of motivation in the city that idea.
"without this objective, the momentum would not have been able to be maintained in the same measures".
Schmidt-trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new point of departure in the longer term, "which takes as a point of departure another agenda".
The Mayor Ole von beust remained on Wednesday in its previous statements, according to which the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg which decides to an application to the Olympics, but the German Federation of the Olympic sports" von beust in online Welt said.
It renvoit amounts to the decision of the Federation of sports at the beginning of December, in connection with the application of Munich for the winter games of 2018.
This priority means for us, that, in the period of time that we had expected until 2028 even there, we will have no chance. "
However the dream does not belong to the past, von beust.
The Sport Federation of Hamburg (hsb) regretted the declarations of beust.
The impression is given that Hamburg does not want to put his candidature for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now", said on Wednesday, the President of the hsb Günter ploß.
An abandonment of the application would be in contradiction with the statements of the leader of the Senate, on the occasion of the reception in pleinière Assembly of the German Federation of higher schools of sport.
There, the von beust would have described the candidature of Hamburg in universiades 2015 as being "not a substitute" to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The confederation of higher schools of sport had initially in the past weeks nominated Hamburg as candidate city.
The SPD fraction of the mayor has accused the Senate not to have used this precious time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"the development of small grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it has played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," the delegates of the SPD Carola veit and Jan quast.
While the SPD has always asked for the small grasbrook a plan integrated in the Olympics and the use of the accommodation, the CDU would bet exclusively on the "factor".
The application for the Summer Olympic Games in 2012 for its part would have raised in Hamburg a great enthusiasm.
Hamburg was though against Leipzig.
This is not the cases of warhols.
The one which links Sweden concepts and wooden case, believe in Ikea, but not Andy warhol.
Or if?
At present, the cases in wood produced in Sweden throw shadow on the list of the works of warhol.
A large part of the ninety brillo-boxs of "Stockholm type" there are listed.
According to the Swedish newspaper "expressen" questioned some months ago the authenticity of the 1968 Andy warhol, the internal investigations of the moderna Stockholm today will lead to a result: six "brillo-boxes", which the former director of the museum Hulten gave in 1995 to the will, are copies - so that a large part of the other hundreds of "type of Stockholm", that circulate on the international market of art.
History is entangled, a disconcerting sequence of artistic and curatoric productions.
In 1964, warhol created in New York its first "brillo-boxes", of the cases in wood, which are based on the design of the boxes of soap powder "brillo".
An exhibition of its work to the will presented in 1968 - with the agreement of warhol - hundreds of cases brillo done box: these did not originate (for financial reasons) of warhol, but had been directly factory of cardboard.
It is not about works of art, but rather of their models, samples of exposure.
At the same time, warhol had given the approval in 1968, to produce a few cases in wood brillo in Sweden, which moreover was not exposed to the will.
Witnesses to the time talk today about fifteen wooden cases which at the time would have entered right in the history of the art and bid, as original of Andy wahrol allowed, with the appelation "type Stockholm".
Some of them have reached in the auctions more than 100 000 dollars.
The problem now is that the legendary manager of the museum hultén claimed, wrongly, later that approximately one hundred cases in wood had been produced and set forth in Sweden in 1968, that warhol would then have given up.
In truth, the 105 cases of hultén have been produced in Malmö in 1990, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
At this time, warhol was already died for three years.
Lars byström, conservative as leader of the moderna will, has examined, next to the six brillo-boxes of museum, three other of private collections suedoises, both of which have been made in Stockholm in 1968: their plates were initially printed and sanded, then they applied with a brush paint white.
The copy which date back to the year 1990 reveals that, in the paint has been directly applied without layer of substance on the panels, with the help of a roll of painting - moreover it is not a matter of a paint, but a acrylic.
"these cases have not been allowed by the artist and should be removed from the list of official brillo-boxes Andy warhol", implies the director of the moderna will, Lars nittve: "if the 'Andy warhol art board' in New York did not come from another decision, the moderna will classify the six cases in its collection as copies / material of exposure."
Already in July the board of course has announced that he would investigate the "heavy charges" which will be raised in the matter of the cases of soap powder.
But since they will ring over there.
