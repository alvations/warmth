The Prague stock market falls against closing time into the loss. 
After the steep waste in the morning the Prague stock exchange to correct the losses. 
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business. 
The Prague stock exchange together at the outset of the Tuesday business to the collapse of Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points. 
This time, the reason for the collapse was because of Wall Street. 
In the Czech Republic, demonstrated that the reaction of the market to the outcome of the vote of the U.S. house of representatives, which had refused to support a plan for the local financial sector. 
The case of shares in Asia 
The shares on the stock markets in Asia has seen a dramatic event on Tuesday, although the figures in the day to offset some of the losses. 
The index the trend Seng stock exchanges in Hong Kong lost in the course of the business day almost four percentage points, was part of the losses, but later make up for, it has reduced the drop to 2.5 percent. 
The index mood Seng China Business, which is monitoring the movement of the Chinese shares on the stock exchange in Hong Kong, fell by 3,8 percent in Shanghai was closed the markets. 
The shares on the stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent reduced, but the loss of 4,3 percent. 
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell after the local index by 3,6 percent. 
“The timing for rescue operation in the united states is uncertain and the financial markets worldwide will affect”, as the head of the monetary authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam. 
Hong Kong says, although it is part of China, its monetary policy, regardless of the Chinese central bank. 
Interest rates in Hong Kong are on the same level as in the United States. 
The American lawmakers should return to the Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd as quickly as possible to the negotiating table and adopt the draft of the financial system. 
Otherwise, it is likely that other countries would be affected by the collapse. 
A massacre of American shares 
The U.S. house of representatives rejected the plan for the support of the financial system in which up to 700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kč) on Monday, should be spent. 
The legislators ignored at the request of president George Bush to support the plan. 
Bush's after that the plan would regulate and would help the underlying causes of the financial crisis to stabilize the entire economy. 
The American shares experienced carnage on Monday, and the most important share indexes made the biggest slump in more than 20 years. 
Of the Dow Jones index fell by nearly seven percent, a similar slump in the year 1987 was last seen. 
The index had sunk before the vote, but there were no signs that the bill in the Lower House would not pass, saw the index a free fall. 
Congress makes concession: US Government 700 billion dollars to banks pump 
The highest representatives of the U.S. congress and the government of president George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial aid for the American financial system. 
For it to be a vote is at the beginning of next week. 
The American legislators have achieved in talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to the American financial system on a scale of 700 billion (about 12 trillion kroner) a breakthrough. 
But this is still a victory. 
The congressional representatives must negotiate a few details of the agreement before they can publish and vote on it the final version of the law. 
The plan to support the financial system on Monday in the U.S. congress. 
On Sunday, according to the chairman of the committee for banking and financial services Barney frank of the agency Reuters. 
In the senate could be voted on various reports as well at the earliest on Wednesday in. 
According to a report economists should be that the plan is adopted, the first important psychological factor for a revival of the financial markets. 
Then come but a “disenchantment” because of the complex mechanisms to help the markets in practice. 
Paulson: The plan must be effective 
“We have made significant progress. 
We have made clear our different views as a package to stabilize the market is looking,” said the agency Bloomberg the democrat Nancy Pelosi. 
According to their words he could come on Sunday to a final vote. 
Representatives of the legislators gathered at night on Sunday with the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government funds in its final form. 
This includes a purchase of unsold mortgage action of the finance companies covered the financial firms in heavy losses and threaten the stability of the whole system. 
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective in the market. 
It is the reorganization plan would continue to go, but I think we are at the target” that Paulson. 
A signal for Asia business 
The global financial crisis is clearly in the stock markets, which are falling sharply. 
In the words of the democratic senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, according to are to be reached the lawmakers tried before Sunday in congress at a final agreement. 
So we want to reassure investors down before business on the Asian financial markets, which are the first time belt, where a decision by the congress could affect the business on Monday. 
So far, however, is not yet clear when both chambers of the U.S. congress will vote on the law, it is unclear whether the negotiations could not be last-minute still because of a problem. 
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days. 
The law is still had some changes. 
The total amount earmarked for helping the system will be divided into two parts. 
The initial 350 billion dollars are as quickly as possible, ready to be tried, as called for president George Bush. 
The congress to block the payment of the remaining money if it gives the impression that it does not meet its function, with another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars. 
Bush rates progress in negotiations positively 
The president has with this decision a veto, but the congress can outvote its veto. 
Despite these changes, but the idea of the program is insists remained, which was founded, finances for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, whose value fell to win because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to their mortgages to pay back. 
“We have everything. 
The house of representatives should be able to vote on Sunday on the bill the senate on Monday,” the republican senator Judd Gregg. 
With the progress content was also president Bush. 
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was with the progress of Saturday and “estimated the shared effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.” 
Restriction of golden parachutes 
The chairman of the banking committee of the senate Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said the legislators on a responsibility for the money, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the conclusion of privileges and a timetable for the financing of the plan would have agreed. 
The new law is to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the scheme and uses a committee that the supervision of the fund will be up to. 
The finance ministry is to lead them. 
“We have worked and a great progress toward an agreement reached very hard on it, and that works for the market, is important for all Americans” in order to Paulson. 
The plan also expects a help for houseowners that have problems with the repayment of their mortgages. 
The government should negotiate new rates with mortgages, which they are buying up, with the goal of reducing the monthly cost of debtors and making it possible, their homes to meet. 
Marek: Psychological help 
The proposed plan is after the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek a good idea, but it is very difficult. 
“Because you do not know what mechanism and at what price the problematic active is purchased. 
That will be crucial, like the financial sector and the government the loss of shares,” said for it to Marek this week the server iHNed.cz. 
If the plan is adopted or at the beginning of next week, is not decisive after Mareks opinion. 
“Much more important that the congressional representatives agree on it, is to be endorsed the plan and that it as quickly as possible relief. 
The psychological importance of consensus that there will be an approval, is at the moment, the most important,” said Marek. 
Duel at knife-edge: MP3-Player against mobile phones. 
We advise you to your election 
While nearly every mobile phones can play MP3-Dateien, still no MP3-Player can telephone. 
So it is, of course, in such a way that it is better to buy only one telephone. 
Despite this, there are plenty of reasons why we should add to its own player. 
The choice is completely dependent on the nature of the use and the future owner. 
It is certainly not buy at home for a mad expensive record player in order to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc. 
Once such musical novelties seem not to LP and qualitative because there is no objective reason for it. 
But if you LP with kind have rock, jazz and Blues on the shelf, probably dream of at least one. 
It is also the music on trips, with compressed music, simplified said, music in the MP3-Format. 
There are to price and quality categories. 
It is perhaps not acceptable to spend on a player eight thousand kroner but also a pink Floyd fan will hardly tolerate headphones for twenty crowns of the market. 
Two extremes, among whom there are enough to each area. 
The choice is wide. 
The life of the batteries is crucial. 
Some good Music players can play much more than music, but they do not even create what mobile phones can do suggestively. 
No modern equipment to be used as universal as the telephone. 
Besides the primary functions, telephone and that windscreen frame sections, can it music and video shows, both include, it has a better times a worse camera and could perhaps navigate. 
And if there is still the Smartphons and communicators, there is almost a small computer in the bag. 
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can photograph crickets and no television. 
But the universality of mobile phones will also bring disadvantages. 
The benefits, will have the more you more functions you on your mobile phone but reload. 
And playing music is one of the biggest Energiefresser. 
Only a few mobile phones can play music more than ten twelve hours, mostly are much less. 
In this regard, Music players (special easiest) are much more efficient. 
So you should count on the cheap mobile phones that they can not play more than a few hours of music. 
If you still telephone now and then, bought for security rather than a battery charger for the post - applies even more expensive equipment. 
With MP3-Playern you will not tolerate the less good this problem at least 9 hours of continuous company with a trademark loading. 
Another problem is when you want to overact music on the mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, only a small part of the equipment has an USB conclusion, but each mobile phone without special software can not be directly linked to a PC. 
Of course we can overact music directly on a storage medium, but few card readers will be finished with no reduction in the tiny memory cards, which are used in mobile phones. 
With players, you do not need special software except for exemptions (iPod). 
They need to feed the equipment only on USB haven with music from your PC. 
The most mobile phones and players even put on a music regulatorily library, according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the category or, for example, the assessment by users. 
Some equipment illustrate the tree structure of the list, such as the Windows Explorer, some can both (more iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system). 
Players are easier to use mobile phones can more 
With the selection of specific equipment, you should ask especially after the life span of accumulator, storage capacity, the quality and the type of noise and, of course, the control of comfort. 
If music is above all façade for you, and if you hear it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, reaches a mobile phone, which plays MP3-Dateien. 
What really knows almost every mobile phone. 
They do not have to control, especially, a mobile phone or a player who music formats can process. 
MP3 create all, and most music that you get, will be especially this format. 
The format was one of the most common, and most devices also music in the WMA format can play. 
AAC (a format that Apple use and iPods) is less than usual. 
More mobile phones are also the purchase of music for online. 
One need only to call on mobiles Internet the pages of a provider (or another supplier), and already you can buy a song or an album. 
This service can already be in itself a blatant argument for why we should add a music mobile phone. 
Unfortunately, it is bad supply of providers and is usually only limited to move in quickly radio. 
The prices are not even the lowest. 
Generally, however, it is expected that this kind of sales of music (it is on Internet GSM, or wireless Internet) will control in the future the music industry. 
Most of the mobile phone. 
If you want to listen to achieve a mobile phone in the jacket pocket, while the player is forgotten at home. 
It depends on whether you always wearing headphones or at least a wireless free speech mechanism. 
If not, you can use the integrated loudspeaker that almost every mobile phones, but only a few MP3-Player has. 
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music mobile phones will be for many in the price. 
The cheapest normally cost less than three thousand crowns. 
For three or four thousand kroner you have already quite decent Walkman. 
The biggest handicap will be for most that no proper headphones are there. 
The best and most technologically advanced phones with a normal 3,5-mm-Öffnung headphones cost up to fifteenth out ending crowns. 
The advantage of the players is again in the easy operation. 
Anyone can really serve the simplest and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players. 
A minimum of works, the similarity during the operation with earlier normal Kassettenrekorder or, for example, the record player is obvious. 
No collision in form one threatens mistakenly employees of mobile Internet and then a horrendous bill for communications. 
For the equipment they should do now 
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a Slot for interchangeable storage media (type microSD M2, etc.). 
Even if you buy a card but two thousand crowns are sufficient. 
But attention. 
With the basic models usually only cards with a maximum capacity are supported by 2 GB. 
Only the most expensive too can read 8-GB-Speicherkarten. 
If you want to have a mobile phone and to buy a cheap MP3-Player, then you have to Cowon, Creativ, Sony and Samsung, Emgeton or more iriver. 
Depending on their capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to put any more than 1100 kronor on the table. 
If you are among the more ambitious listeners, take more specialized mobile phones, Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung). 
These devices have independent operating knobs for MP3, and the control of comfort approaches to individual MP3-Players. 
Here is the furthest Sony Ericsson, whose mobile phone from the series Walkman has the same user interface as the MP3-Player sold separately. 
The same services at the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long accumulator life-span (normally 15 hours, up to a maximum of 35 hours) MP3-Player manufacturers' abovementioned carries out for you. 
The first virtual supplier is already this year to the Czech Republic. 
Perhaps 
The mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, the Czech providers offers a virtually all services, how they are offered by their partners in Western Europe. 
However, this is not a little, a virtual supplier, forcing the classic to lower prices. 
Perhaps that will no longer be long in coming. 
The Czech mobile phone operators work on the most expensive in Europe, we have often Mobil.cz reported. 
This confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price for a SMS here is higher than in the rest of the European union. 
After the final stages of the European commission in the adaptation of roaming charges so it is probably a paradox, for some customers of the Czech mobile phone operators SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home. 
How is it that prices are so high in the Czech Republic, compared with Europe? 
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition, which really is a challenge. 
Perhaps it sounds paradoxically, in the Czech Republic, there are three mobile networks and the enforcement of more than 100%. 
The mobile phone operators grumble opposed happy about the fact that there is a lot of competition in the Czech market. 
Often, the chairman of the council of the Czech telecommunications authority (ČTÚ) agrees with Pavel Dvořák, which has often expressed in the past that there is no place for another supplier in the Czech Republic. 
It is true that a classic supplier with its own network does not have any more particularly many opportunities (it would probably find little frequencies). 
But there is another possibility, a virtual supplier. 
The access of virtual operators on the mobile phone market has a clear price reduction in itself, including the classic mobile phone operators then had to react. 
There have been similar votes before the access of such companies such as Tesco to mobile or Virgin Mobile market in Britain as in the Czech Republic. 
But it has been shown that there is room for such suppliers and that they can really be successful. 
By the way, you need to look for a long time, for example. 
This February we spoke at the start of the virtual supplier Mobilking in Poland. 
In just six months, managed to this supplier to win more than 100 thousand customers and become in such a way to five-largest supplier of the country. 
Behind the Mobilking Penta- banking association, which stands for US in Czech Republic, among other things. fon has. 
The advantage of virtual providers lies with the fact that we can focus on a much more specific target group. 
In order to be able to operate effectively, virtual providers need much less customers as a classic supplier. 
They need a relatively high costs of the building, the company and maintaining a mobile network. 
In the world, so the virtual providers are normally themselves as Low Cost companies, they offer cheap telephone calls and SMS, what is often accompanied by a less extensive service. 
For example, Tesco offers mobile in Britain SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors. 
However, as an example of Mobilking points to Poland, it can also be a good move to put on a plateful not targeted. 
This supplier is directed specifically to men. 
“Real chaps Mobilking - elect the supplier who made them and what they can trust,” David Seibert, the CEO of the mobiles entertainment company, the company of this virtual supplier. 
To say on whether a similar approach could gain in Poland in the Czech Republic. 
The press spokesman for Vodafone Miroslav Čepický doubt: “The Czech market is relatively low for a market segment in which most virtual operators are based. 
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the perspective of service.” 
In the Czech Republic chanceless, mobile phone operators believe 
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile phone carrier conquers Czech Republic that will not be Mobilking. 
“We are talking about an extension of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic negotiations do not look particularly hopeful. 
It will come to a market access for Mobilking in other countries in the region,” then Jana Studničková, press spokesman for the banking syndicate Penta- says in a telephone call for Mobil.cz. 
Indirectly confirmed that the current mobile phone operators have not been particularly prone to the Czech Republic that idea. 
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything to ensure that any potential competitor. 
Their interest in the launch of a virtual mobile phone carrier shows for a long time the group of GTS Novera who want to take another step towards a real competitor of Telefónica CO2 in corporate clients. 
“We have a strong interest in it, our customers not only fixed network to offer but mobile telecommunications. 
And the sooner, the better. 
On the way we negotiated repeatedly with all the Czech mobile phone operators. 
With some of them we have already achieved negotiation progress”, so the press spokesman for the group of Pavel Kaidl. 
Perhaps now better times. 
With no official information indicates that the first virtual supplier is to be expected by the end of the year. 
So far, however, it is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence. 
“At this moment we do not trust in the Czech Republic held for a full virtual supplier. 
The Czech market has great Specifics compared to other markets. 
So far, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area, means” in its statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil Sršeň from the press office of Telefónica CO2. 
The specifics of the Czech market continues providers. 
The press spokeswoman von T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with the declaration of CO2: “So far we have found no viable and reciprocally favourable project, which could be built.” 
And he adds: “In the network of T-Mobile until the end of the year, barely a virtual supplier will emerge. 
At the moment, we must have a concrete offer to attend to think all short-term.” 
Vodafone is drawing more attention to meet the needs of its own 3G-Lizenz. 
Miroslav Čepický resources: “For negotiations with potential virtual suppliers, we are open, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure. 
We see this from the perspective of the customers as the best. 
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is in the search for a partner to build a shared network for a quick mobile Internet.” 
The responsible authorities, with the suppliers hand-in-hand 
The trial of the mobile phone operators is easy to understand, another supplier would mean more competition, this to falling prices and to a drop in profits would lead. 
So why should we make the market access for such a competitor? 
The fact that the operators can work together, if it is something that is also the long back and forth by the emergence of US: fon. 
Perhaps the most pressure toward ČTÚ at present, as US: fon on the market, from society T-Mobile got along. 
The publicly - available information occupied by the ČTÚ websites. 
But now it is suitable American: fon as a reason why we should not allow a virtual supplier. 
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has recently strengthened by the market access for a fourth mobile phone operator. 
Given the nature of the mobile phone market in the Czech republic, it is clear that a new player would make high demands on the market and in particular his services.” 
In light of the actions of the mobile phone operators, however, the absolute lack of interest in the Czech regulators surprises. 
It is not just about the attitude of the ČTÚ who do not have the authority to Czech people unfortunately, in contrast to Britain and other developed countries, to intervene in the economic competition. 
This is only the office for the protection of the economic competition (ÚOHS). 
However, this was a very typical attitude to the entire problem. 
“The market access to a virtual mobile phone carrier would be possible, after it came to a conclusion of a contract, the infrastructure needed between a mobile phone operator and a virtual provider on rent. 
So far, none has concluded that treaty because the offer of potentially interested was probably for the classic suppliers not sufficiently interesting” that in his response to our request Kristián Chalupa of the ministry of foreign - affairs of the ÚOHS. 
Representatives from the providers such wording would not surprising. 
An authority that consumer interests to represent, among other things, it is to ensure that no one is abusing its position in the market, is this more than precarious. 
Especially if Kristián Chalupa adds: “Abroad, where virtual suppliers working quite normally, it is apparent that its market access contributed to a price reduction cell phone services.” 
But the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction do not belong to the interests of the ÚOHS. 
Almost shocking the agreement of the three mobile phone carrier already touching on this case, which results from their reactions, is real. 
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is obvious. 
In the same way that absolutely gasoline price resembles the gas stations surely only chance, and the result of a tough competition. 
“The authority did not discover that any signs that point to act against the competition, and therefore has no reason to intervene in some way in the matter. 
Neither the supplier has a dominant market position, so it is not the appropriate greater responsibility for his actions on the market. 
The necessary tools for an opening of the mobile phone market for virtual operators are not likely to the regulatory authority for telecommunications, Chalupa said in his statement. 
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious issues. 
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, prepared by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications from the perspective of economic competition is a single market. 
In such a market then, of course, none of the Czech mobile phone operators holds a dominant position. 
Some legal experts, however, offer another aspect of the market access to a virtual supplier has always supported by the network user is necessary. 
And the mobile phone carrier - logically, on its network the monopoly. 
It means that it will take a dominant position in a certain segment. 
Even if you do not go along with this reasoning, it should be for the ÚOHS at least a warning that three mobile phone operators are remarkably similar. 
Complaints of a series of interested parties ,including the society said GTS Novera) show that they encounter with negotiations with all providers very similar obstacles. 
The transfer of the responsibility for the ČTÚ is in the telecommunications a perfectly normal trick with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole affair. 
This has been seen in some similar cases. 
Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in getting the recently adopted amendment of the telecommunications law extending the authority of the ČTÚ in terms of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts that it had promised to improve the situation. 
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know that all too well, but they have other interests. 
It is as if no one looks 
A functioning any remains ignored pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks. 
There are companies who spend own price lists on mobile telecommunications, which are only partially public. 
Normally it is companies that operate in the area multi-level marketing. 
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others. 
The price lists of these companies are usually only at chosen one. 
The joke of the matter is that with the company as an operator to traditional corporate customers, which has a large quantity of SIM cards orders. 
As an important customer then it gets special quotes (and other offers). 
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile phone operators ban a similar accounted for resale. 
“There should be cases that tell you, it is a violation of contract terms with concern, which we will look to” answered Kemrová Martina lead to an end to cooperate with our society to question on this issue. 
However, it is unlikely that it does not get around with the leaders of the mobile phone operators. 
Particularly in the case of the three companies said this may be thousands of customers. 
No operator opposes such a procedure. 
From the activities of these companies to their profits to be neglected does not flow, at the same time, in contrast to the actual virtual providers, not by real official marketing is compromised. 
On possible problems Miroslav Čepický draws attention: “The law allows such kinds of speculation, despite all the services of these companies by only a very small percentage of clients. 
They must also accept that the SIM map does not run in his telephone on their names, so it can fully on it as ordinary customers of the mobile phone operators.” 
Alone, but the ČTÚ would have to occur at least strange. 
In addition, another question for the ÚOHS opens. 
Do the mobile phone operators before such a procedure close their eyes, why they fill out against a virtual provider? 
It is to be added to the fact that the ÚOHS has very strong authority to detect such activities and if it does not want, does not have it with the declaration of the suppliers, you would know nothing themselves and their business conditions that would ban would be met. 
The Czech Republic is not the most expensive longer 
As has repeatedly emphasized in the text, the market access of virtual providers brought a sharp fall in prices in the various services. 
Virtually all countries where virtual providers emerged, the traditional providers tried to prevent whose emergence practically more or less. 
The argument that they were virtually identical, too small, or too much saturated market, problems with the quality of service, and so on. 
In the developed countries but has engaged in these moments regulatory bodies that did not try to protect the interests of the mobile phone operators, but those of their customers. 
If it is formal action or not-formal pressure, they have achieved the first virtual operator developed, and further followed this. 
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies to throw out the entire case like a hot potato. 
On the basis of our experience, we can not the impression to get rid of this ambiguity is as good as the authority in these cases. 
But we do not throw the gun in the grain. 
If the background is accurate and soon a virtual supplier arises, the Czech mobile phone market will contact may soon. 
If a supplier allows the emergence of a virtual mobile phone operator, the ÚOHS will not stand idly by when it comes to other interested parties to refuse to discriminate against (). 
And the Czechs will not last longer telephone more expensive than in the rest of Europe. 
The new Czech anthem has four new versions. 
Choose the best 
Maybe the four versions of the new Czech national anthem. 
On Sunday, prime minister Mirek Topolánek asked the new photographs of the national anthem at the time of the day of the Czech statehood in a ceremony where is my home. 
The anthem was brought in by the orchestra of the national theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek. 
Four versions are available, with male or female solo song in chorus version and in an instrumental version. 
The song version took over Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka. 
The editors of the anthem versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček. 
On the server iHNed.cz you can hear directly all four versions. 
For Bělohlávek the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful anthems. 
Previously he had told the Czech radio, he was elected representative voices are salient and popular for the solo variants singers with young. 
“From the beginning, I tried to both and then with the chorus to keep a clear diction so that we understand the text, together with an agreement to develop”, so the conductor. 
The Czech national anthem next year is celebrating its 175. Anniversary. 
The song Kde domov můj rang out for the first time, 1834 on the stage of the land theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka of Josef Kajetán Tyl, music came from František Škroup. 
It became popular, and people accepted it immediately. 
The first strophe of the song would then after the emergence of Czechoslovakia during 1918, an organic part of the national anthem. 
One of the seven state symbols stayed even after the emergence of an independent Czech republic. 
As the “new” anthem sounds 
The Prague of transport services bears on Wednesday for the first time on a chip 
The Wednesday, which will be 1 2008, history of the Prague of transport services as the date on which into an underground, tram or a bus passengers in the first champion who wear an electronic coupon in the bag, rather than a paper ticket. 
About a hundred thousand people can buy at present, those who have the smart card Opencard. 
The passengers can buy a 30-Tage, a 90-Tage or a one-year coupon (force from 1 2009) and let them on their smart card game at the same time, in the info centres and branches of the transport services at the underground stations, Muzeum Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka. 
The coupons are available since yesterday on the Internet on the part of the transport services www.dpp.cz. 
The service was included in the afternoon hours over four hundred customers. 
Those who use the Internet sales, really can forget the spending window in the underground stations where they had to wait until now regularly in long queues for their paper tickets. 
They buy the coupon via the Internet, are played by those on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the municipal library. 
“In these places a desk with trained personnel to the passengers, who is interested in the Internet shopping and also on the map, as the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný plays a coupon. 
In addition to the library one may be able to play the electronic coupons at self-service machines at the Opencard annexed in some U-course-Vestibüls. 
How do such machines? 
They are red, recall fahrscheinentwerter with passengers they may have in the underground stations, Roztyly Budějovická, Ith P. Pavlova, and Florenc Vltavská notices. 
“There are currently eighty in the town of five of them, at the end of the year, but it should be” adds Opatrný. 
An automat controls the coupon instead of the driver 
The operation of the machines, which will tomorrow function is simple. 
It is only the smart card would bring in, and the before acquired coupon is played by itself. 
The electronic coupons are regarded as of tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also in the environment. 
In the suburb trains and on the bus lines with paragraphs 300 and 499 above all the inhabitants of communities in the region of central Bohemia entering the capital. 
“In the aisles belonging to integrated traffic in Prague, the train companions have readers with which they can” to declare examine the validity of coupons after time and zone Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid ticket control. It makes the timetables for the Prague of transport services. 
The suburb of buses have card readers at the cash with the driver. 
When entering the smart card does not only have to be presented with the driver, but the Opencard is to be placed on a marked place at the side of the cash. 
Thus, the driver who controls the validity of playing coupons. 
“Wants a passenger to investigate the validity of playing coupons, is nothing less than the driver for this information to ask” so Drápal.

Referendum Sudetes demanded by the united states 
The Sudeten Germans had asked for 1945 for belonging to the Bohemian Forest to the United States. 
Such a letter that stores in the collections of southBohemian scientific library. 
If we can not be part of Germany and Austria, we would like to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America. 
With such a desire 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans at the US presidents should have appealed. 
This is partly from a letter that remained in private archives, which is now being kept in the collections of southBohemian scientific library. 
The german Krumau ask in the letter, the American president, it is the return “Sudetes gau”, which has taken on the basis of Munich agreements by Hitler - Czechoslovakia not to allow. 
“We wanted the situation correctly understood and we really the words to make sure that the American forces did not oppressors and enemies in German territory, but as liberators,” it said in a letter that with the words “people, to whom the fate of Sudetes is concerned about” is signed. 
In the context of Czechoslovakia the Sudeten Germans, with knowledge of the Czech national character, leaving to assume that they would expect brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, asks the authors of the letter, the American president to take over for today and forever the protectorate over the Bohemian Forest. 
“We do not believe that you award without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million people in this area to a state strange for us which oppresses minorities and tried to remove and absolutely nothing to the victory of the allies did not contribute” to read the letter. 
The reason why the authors can not sign, was allegedly the fear of Rachegelüsten of “Czech oppressors.” 
If the american president has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, there is enough if it would launch in Bohemian Forest gau referendum on whether the people wanted or under a protectorate of the United States to live in the united states. 
Although the text of the letter in today's knowledge of post-war may seem a little naive, it provides a good picture yet, according to some modern witnesses regarding expectations at the time of the Sudeten Germans. 
Even if the Bohemian Germans had to guess at least that one should negotiate about his expulsion from the republic confessed only few from such a possibility. 
Some have maintained that the United States and Britain for Sudetes would negotiate a kind of autonomy. 
Others believe that they could be easy in Czechoslovakia. 
The famous Austrian journalist confirms Gustav Chalupa, which dates from Budweis. 
It was used in the war as Budweiser German at the navy at the Baltic Sea. 
When he came at the end of the war in British captivity and put it into a prisoner-of-war camp after Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him, he had to Czech to teach. 
“You think when they came home, became the Czech too fit come” Chalupa. 
None of the German prisoners of war, who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, expected after his views on carrying it out on the basis of the Beneš decrees from the republic. 
You do not, then pay. 
An emotional campaign is aimed at drivers 
Most expensive action for safety on the roads in Czech history. 
The emotional media campaign would then be characterize that wants to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday. 
The authority of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to divert drivers of dangerous conduct behind the wheel. 
The campaign for 150 million kroner will run on television, radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyern. 
It is to divert the drivers of too fast driving fashion and alcohol and driving. 
And they also point to strap itself before departure. 
The campaign wants to talk mostly young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least drivers in the conscience. 
And, as reported in the spots? 
Especially stories of people who call at emotions. 
It also “bloody” slogan of the whole campaign witnesses: 
You do not, then pay. 
The words “do not think” stand in capital letters on a kennzeichenschild. 
And in a puddle of blood and then the word “pays”. 
This means that we can pay a moment inattentiveness with their own lives. 
The spots “will shock” viewers to 2010. 
The Ministry could inspire from similar campaigns in the anglo-saxon countries where you can see quite normally pictures with dramatic photographs of casualties. 
It promises to the fact that the accident figures and the number of deaths on the Czech roads falling. 
The spots were ordered by the agency euros RSCG. 
The carrot and stick to the drivers 
“For the drivers the slogan carrot-and-stick applies. 
Carrot means they when they drive for example at the red light spare time. 
The whip is the threat of a penalty or an accident. 
The driver must be reminded of risk”, so the transport psychologist from the hospital and Martin Homolce Kořán. 
And that is why information campaigns are in the press and above all the negative publicity, mean the psychologist. 
Already are less effective he feels boards, which draw the attention of the drivers to a threat. 
“It imposes a static board, which warns of danger, they probably soon with the environment will go through, and that is not to say” drivers Kořán. 
Olmert would return nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace 
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert spoke to return virtually all areas that have been fined 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan heights, if we can make peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it. 
He said in an interview that was printed on Monday by the newspaper Jediot Achronot. 
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, so it means that it is necessary to return areas almost all (occupied) if everything” did not even say Olmert to the newspaper. 
“We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to the Palestinians a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) transfer, because there will be no peace without it,” he added. 
He acknowledged that a possible return will also include East Jerusalem. 
“The person who wants and above all does not want security in Jerusalem that tractors and bulldozers hand-rolling Olmert said in reference to his feet, as has happened to one of my best friends without a part of Jerusalem to do will have” on two attacks in the city of July, in which several people were killed and dozens of people were injured. 
According to the Prime Minister will be needed to find a “special solution to the temple Berne and sacred and historical sites” on the territory of the old part of town. 
“The person who wants to preserve the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city, will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs. 
That will not work” to confirm it. 
Withdrawal of the Golan heights 
Olmert called for an israeli withdrawal from the Golan heights, which according to him, a prerequisite for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria. 
This would require but certain effort on the part of Damascus. 
“My proposal is not made, with Syria simply on the basis of a withdrawal of the Golan heights make peace,” Olmert said. 
“The Syrier knows all too well that they must renounce to get back the Golan heights. 
They will have to do without their current relationship with Iran; they will have to do without their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to provide” concrete, has to do with terrorism (Shiite) of the Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (holy war) in Iraq without the constant support the prime minister. 
Questions about the accident. Stewards are illegal in the bus? 
The law does not know it, in a remote coach is not allowed to run 
In connection with the tragic accident involving a bus in society student Representation in the vicinity of the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and passengers can go back and forth while driving in the bus. 
“We wanted to keep strictly and formally the legislation, the work of a stewards contradicts the law on the road,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka. 
The accident, which last week a twenty-two-year old hostess died, was probably caused by the driver of the Trucks, which crossed the bus. 
The young woman sat at the time of the accident, next to the driver, at least the safe place in the car, although she had two other positions. 
However, a bus or may have sharply brake at the moment an accident in which the steward is delivering coffee or newspapers. 
A role, whether the bus vehicle registration is equipped with standing rooms after another. 
If this is not included in the bus passengers must sit. 
The remote coaches of student Agency have no standing rooms; the director of the company, confirmed Radim Jančura, opposite Aktuálně.cz. 
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and it did not agree with the movement of passengers. 
Later, they took it back, and we have reached a consensus that passengers can go while driving on the toilet, if they have their headquarters”, he told his position. 
The law does not know a steward 
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a stewards, no legislation describes this role. 
However, there is no law, which forbids the winner to provide services. 
The law on the transport knows only the concept vehicle companion; his rights and obligations, but it is not acceptable”, a spokesman for the Ministry Hanzelka clearly. 
The director of the department of transport vehicles of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný but means that the law later covers this problem. 
“It depends on whether the bus in the product approval has also standing rooms. 
That is all,” he stressed. 
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, transport buses with standing rooms and a higher allowed speed and remote coaches without standing rooms with the highest permitted speed and seats, which are equipped with safety belts. 
As the plane, expert says 
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards aboard a bus. 
“With a liquid driving fashion many risks, the situation will not threaten are similar to the service on board a plane. 
Is not safe again when turbulence, and the hostess can override the head.” 
“But a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics. 
Just as in the city bus or in a tram. 
The security of the stewards to clarify the winner by internal rules,” says it and also means that this problem from the point of view of the law is not completely resolved. 
Jančura is prepared to remove the services 
Student Agency provides services of stewards as the only bus company. 
The company employs about two hundred people in this job. 
The director does not consider his career after the accident as risk pregnant. 
“As soon as I get the impression that the occupation of the stewards risk is pregnant, I will remove. 
Coffee and newspapers can receive when passengers arriving. 
That would lower, means” the costs. 
As interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses. His company has only a fraction of the lines in comparison with student Agency. 
“We do not have hostesses, on the other hand, we are right from the start. 
Sooner or later this ends with a fatal accident,” it a year ago for Týden.cz had not fully said. 
That was an enormous tragedy 
In the crash of a bus to Naples a young hostess from the region Pilsen had had an accident, who had worked for two years to society. 
The slovene truck was bent and had blocked the trip to the bus without probably flash from standing tyre. 
The driver of the bus tried to escape from a sharp manoeuvring clashed with the right front part of the truck. 
The fact that the two places for the stewards were sold denies Jančura. 
“These bodies can not be reserved for remote links, they are blocked.” 
The company wants to sue Truck drivers. 
With a compensation for the families of the young woman, the agency for the court decision not to wait a financial compensation expects it but also on the part of the blame. 
A law change? 
Not in sight 
A more detailed regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal system, in which a thirty-member expert panel of the Ministry of Transport is already working for over a year. 
“But even arrived at no definite conclusion. 
Buses are not completely on the agenda, but the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the trip” for specialist Hořín. 
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards as something that could endanger the safety of passengers significantly” so Hanzelka, taking control of the security of the buses lies in the authority of the police and the industrial safety authorities. 
Düsseldorfer hopes resting at Frankfurt 
At large said it is not missing in the letter of the WestLB executive committee to the staff of the house. 
It brought in on Monday to become known letters from units Düsseldorfer of bank in Frankfurt Deka bank can “the central capital market house jointly by the bank banking association” arise. 
The WestLB would bring a “authority to block” sustainable yield capacity in such a deal. 
And all this can be a decisive blow to further bundlings in the regional sector. 
So it is when an executive committee wants to demonstrate in difficult time ability to act. 
Because the bruised WestLB still is under enormous pressure. 
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also by the Federal institute for supervision of financial services, which made it clear to the government recently, the time of pressure to find a solution. 
From there, as always, any link between the Deka bank savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and which is WestLB but for some time, the speech at Frankfurt. 
Deka bank head of Franz Waas let highway with a regional, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, in a merger of the house in Mainz, is familiar with the presentation of the annual figures half of August he no sense. 
But the board of directors of the Deka supported ever half by the regional and the clubs of savings banks, gave the executive committee to lead the WestLB of discussions on joint business activities. 
This could be capital-market operation or parts of it. 
The talks have undoubtedly, it is just beginning with the financial centre. 
From the Deka bank, one of its 3000 staff among the more important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not for the first time to talk about consolidation in the bank sector. 
2003 long it looked at such a time, as if the Deka bank with the regional and the Helaba could fuse. 
From this three-federation whatsoever. 
The plans were hardly be publicly declared itself the government against a part of the Helaba in it. 
The other two houses did not find it to each other. 
The regional Rhineland-Palatinate went instead to the regional baden-württemberg in Stuttgart. 
But it was thought play again and again on a combination of Deka bank with regional. 
But Günther Merl, chairman of the Helaba had spoken out against last planning games on bringing together with his house. 
But the reality is independent mature that moving closer together the various houses of the public sector is needed. 
Now that the election of the past is in Bavaria, linking the BayernLB with the regional could move closer baden-württemberg first. 
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news. 
If the pressure should rise to further mergers, you go out gradually partners for it. 
In the south, it would be more junior partner, although they got through the financial crisis so far, far better than have the houses in Munich and Stuttgart. 
Once again, the bank and giro centre association hesse Thuringia involved with 85 percent of the Helaba, placed at the beginning of the year, a stop to unite forward with the west LB. 
The north would if necessary remain LB. 
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side. 
On the other side there is the question of how the various business models of the individual homes fit to each other. 
June expressed Merl, which is not a crucial issue that business model, the future of the regional is guaranteed by the German savings bank and giro centre association previously responded. 
In the end the dismantling of the west LB could face, but it certainly desired. 
Like that of the speech, it is certainly a “overall solution” for the house is sought in the letter of the executive committee. 
How can bring about the unifying of individual units with Deka bank, will still be seen. 
The second Octoberfest weekend is known as a “Italian weekend” 
For Elena it is first already Luca, for the third or fourth time. 
But this time is Elena as his friend, and so it is different, says it. 
Behind them, with the five-litre beer keg of mark emperor, is a major built bearded and proves that about 200 Octoberfest travellers, how deep tones his throat to get out. 
Elena are only a flip to Luca, then a kiss. 
From Bologna they came to Verona. 
From here, the bus car park alongside the station Puorta Nuova, arrived at 6,30 o'clock this evening at 23.45 four buses, “destinazione Monaco festa della birra”, expected to start noon. 
Three buses are mainly the Italians reserved, in a bus travel exclusively Brazilians. 
In a corner of the car park already sing the south Americans alongside their flag, celebrated them at night. 
And so loudly, Marco Guarda, that says nothing is for Italians. 
The buses are Marco, which has a long coat with Pelzimitatfutter and glasses with broad silver bars. 
For five years they drive three routes to the Octoberfest, be it this year alone. 
At night, during the day at the Octoberfest, at 22.30. 
To stay hotel Marco would mean, says only unnecessary costs. 
75 Euros the trip, the Willkommensumtrunk with emperor beer brewed, faithful to the Bavarian purity regulations, costing the health insurance and the german-speaking travel line, Marco visited a language course in Frankfurt, including. 
And the coaches already roll into the night on the Autostrada direction “Brennero.” 
There is no beer, yet. 
It will soon be in the bus, sleep passengers. 
And so, they will still need their forces. 
Is held in Brixen and wood churches, where some other buses with Italian characteristics of the highway 8 insert a break near Munich again. 
When Marcos group finally arriving on schedule around half seven at noon early one the Theresienwiese close to the car park, there are other buses from all over Europe to 50. 
Elena, Luca and others collect themselves, Marco hold a final statement, explaining the plan of attack. 
First: The yellow Käppchen. 
That is in addition to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency is focused on the left of “Octoberfest” in fracture: “conoscersiviaggiando.it.” 
Two: “If the doors to the beer tent come up, according to run. ” Marco calls in the morning. 
“Racing!” And the posts in the rear part of the tent filled. 
“In front, otherwise we will not block, and not all yellow caps on the same banks in the area to distribute!” 
The measure, roars Marco, cost 8.25 euros. 
And tip do not forget. 
“The security personnel it shows that we are behaving well. 
Once they leave the sites, are they go!” 
Three: “Appear again here tonight point half eleven!” Understood? 
And it goes to the Octoberfest. 
Unterweg binds yellow caps as a way to mark the trees, and even some evidence to the election posters of a large Bavarian people's party. 
We want to be prepared for the withdrawal. 
It is the second Octoberfest weekend when “Italian weekend.” 
There are no specifics about figures; the talks about 50 of,000, which make themselves and to invade the beer tents on their way through the alps, ten percent all visitors is this weekend extra from Italy to have visited. 
Munich police will be strengthened, Italian volunteers supported by seven policemen from South Tyrol the Bavarian red cross, resulting in a nation statistics, in which the Italians before an englishman (about 60 deployments) and Austrians (80) with about 200 medical supplies the first place occupied. 
With the Italians Hofbräuzelt is especially popular. 
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo real Estate 
The German banking system passed relatively stable, said Finance minister Peer Steinbrück only in the week. 
As well as the politician used and even enwove the word “relatively” that the German banking sector is not spared the crisis-charged developments. 
Because they arrived at the weekend. 
The DAX Munich real estate financer Hypo recorded real Estate (HRE) receives from a consortium of German banks a billion-credit to shield itself from the turmoil in the markets. 
One of the things people trusted Reuters said on Monday, the credit aid amounted to 35 billion euros. 
The Hypo real Estate has to pay interest on the part that she also addresses. 
The money comes from both private and public banks. 
Background are losses in the daughter Depfa. 
The Staatsfinanzierer had refinanced itself extremely at short notice, according to a newspaper report for long periods projects, for which he received money, which is now no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets. 
In the first half of 2008, the cash reserve bank had shrunk, including the equity capital quota slightly from 1,6 to 1,45 percent had given way by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros. 
The current earnings and net proceeds from financial transactions were over the period last year zero, the proceeds from attributions of demands and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of reserves in the loan business by more than 70 percent to 5 million. 
Only thanks to higher returns from refunds of stored accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as from the reimbursement of interest for the tax code and the management of secretary of state enterprises, the yield on minus 16 percent had to be even moderate. 
That former Staatsfinanzierer had made a bad speculation after its privatization in the year 1990, first with commercial real estate loans, which had been separated in the Aareal bank. 
Because they earned too little in the classic state funding, the Depfa was then strengthened in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state committed (private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversifizierrt. 
The value of the daughter the Hypo must make real Estate now write-offs, which will have a “substantial material effect” on the profit and loss account of the group, called it a vague. 
The fact is that the dividend was removed. 
For 2007, it had been cut by two-thirds. 
The Hypo real Estate has since the Depfa took an important state and Infrastrukturfinanzierer. 
It is more than other institutes at the refinancing at the interbank market because it does not have a client deposits. 
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago credit under the banks is largely dries up, so the banks their liquidity strongholds. 
The Hypo real Estate needs a year for a part - approximately 50 billion of the loan portfolio of Depfa short-term funds for refinancing. 
After report of the Hypo material, the financial needs of the group with the credit is in the foreseeable future covered for Property and the company “of the influence of currently largely nonfunctioning international money markets” protected. 
From other sources, it is said that because of the money the refinancing of 2009 is assured. 
The HRE CEO George spark said, however, that the Hypo will not have to take real Estate Group included the money markets in the foreseeable future. 
Federal Bank and the Federal institute for supervision of financial services (BaFin) assume the marketability of the Hypo is real Estate group now. 
That stands for shareholders and creditors of the bank of hope. 
But given the momentum and uncertainties about the crisis there can be no certainty. 
It is not inconceivable that funding does not have to be included in its entirety. 
However, the opposite is not auszuschleißen. 
After Sunday on late evening after hearing the bank stood before the bankruptcy, at least temporarily rescue is not able to reassure the mood. 
The share price breaks in by 75 percent to 3.30 euros. 
Against the lending rates remain quite good. 
If the priority debts last themselves barely moved show, giving the courses of Nachrang loans. 
Above all, hitting the loans from the former subsidiary are Württemberg Hypo and understandably journey times beyond 2009. 
If Hypo real Estate loans appear before a speculative plant alternative, their value to the significant increase in banking crisis and the institute, which had just caught up with the takeover of Depfa crisis in the house when dependent on the stability of the international financial system is considered. 
As long as the central banks, government and less bruised commercial banks in support of the system is ready, it can be stemmed from a period-fristgemäßen repayment of pensions. 
And it is one that hardly anyone dares to look at the moment, that the financial crisis is bridge over the next 15 months. 
But given the messages to assess the partial nationalisation from the probability bordering security only a legitimate hope is currently. 
This should prepare especially some sleepless nights with the decision for long-term creditors, whether they are separate from its liabilities. 
Short-term investors can use a line for a loss brought forward from previous accounts for the future of paying off tax payments on gains in later years. 
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento box 
When Sylvana Hiltrop, is to imagine 16, on the first day of school to the Tachibana Highschool, the girls catch on too kichern: The German is total “kawaii”! 
What this means? 
Sylvana knows the word from a gas, in the new exchange that she tells of Japan. 
“The first day of school in Japan. 
I was excited. 
Even before the way to school I had Bammel. 
I live on the fringes of Tokyo toward Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes, the Tachibana Highschool. 
I had to find the way alone, fortunately, I have not got lost. 
Beginning of instruction appears not strictly defined as the Tachibana as at home in Lower Saxony. 
The pupils roll up after eight o'clock until around twenty nine a brief discussion round begins with the teacher, the “home room.” 
But before school started, I was in turn to me. 
I am not the type who likes to talk to people, especially in a class of 40 pupils. 
Because I have not had a school uniform, I had suffered an old rock of my guest mother, however, blue blouse knee socks and black leather shoes. 
In the elevator I asked myself and therefore tried before the desk to make everything properly: “Sayonara where she Sylvana…” I hot Sylvana, come from Germany and have in one week birthday. 
At the moment, I was very pleased that I had already begun before over two years to learn the language. 
The 31 girls in the class gossiped secretly, and gekichert gewunken and I keep the word “Kawaii” all heard. 
I already knew that from my one gas. 
It is a critical vocabulary of Japanese girl and means “nicely, sweetly.” 
I am quickly flitted in my place. 
The girl grinned beside me, i thought it was rather an extensive credit that the exchange student alongside it should sit. 
The rest of the time was more calm, but when the gong sounded, I was stormed outright. 
All the talk in disarray and kicherten and asked me holes in the stomach, genuinly it is difficult to understand Japanese English. 
In the break all their unpacked Bentos. 
My guest mother had made such a Lunchbox for me, that is times something other than desert German break bread. 
I had rice with herbs, small small sausages, salad from cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the Tofumantel. 
I usually do not have a pale embers, what I eat here in Japan. 
Things look strange and taste entirely new. 
What is clear is that all genuinly more delicious. 
Naja, until the salty inserted plums, perhaps brrrr! 
The Bentos is at Japanese schools, not just the lunch. 
Sometimes it is the fact that a girl gives a boy a Bento even prepared, which is preparing her then skilful, particularly in the hope that closer knows the boy with the break snack to learn. 
I was in my Manga comics. 
I am now interested to see if I can also see here. 
“Why calculated Japan? ” my friends asked me when I told them that I want to go for a year in Tokyo to school. 
I always said: 
“Because it fascinates me.” 
Finally, I read a gas for years, most of all. 
And so I the comics and culture in better understand, I also took some time to get a little Japanese. 
For me, it was clear that I had to travel at some point here. 
Because I have a Faible for traditions, habits and customs. 
And it is a great value. 
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strictly, disciplined and traditional. 
And because it is so well organized, I did not feel here yet lost, even if Tokyo is the largest city where I ever saw.” 
Also rats have feelings 
A rat or a cockroach flees with danger is that it is also fear? 
The neuro scientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Too many animals have feelings. 
Just as they were investigating whether the same feeling when they behave as we? 
In the Internet magazine “Edge” are published for several years of contributions of famous scientists. 
Spiegel online presented in a series elected answers to the question “what you believe it to be able to prove without it?” 
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness, unless I or anyone else to show where we could even to prove not to be able to other people have consciousness. 
But in this case we must hope at least, since all human brains are the same basic configuration. 
As soon as we are, however, other species and questions of feeling or generally awareness address we enter hard-to-travel area because the hardware disagrees. 
If a rat is at risk, it is the same as many other animals: It is dead, flees or attacks. 
People are similarly, some scientists close on comparable subjective experience. 
I do not think. 
Two aspects of the brain structure, making it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to of animals. 
On the one hand, almost always the circuits associated with human consciousness close the lateral prefrontal Cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the remark/control functions). 
This vast region is much more sophisticated with people than with the other primates and appears with other creatures to be missing. 
At least with those aspects of our awareness to plan and decide which depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among them is the knowledge, who we are, and the ability to think that people are very different from the other primates. 
Another dramatic capacity will be in the linguistic human nature: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said, awareness depends on it. 
In this case, it could exclude animals. 
But even if awareness did not depend on language, this would undoubtedly influence them so that animal awareness may also be accounted for, like it, probably a lot of most of our awareness of differences. 
It is difficult to determine how awareness may look to other animals. 
If it is something at home and subjective, neither nor study, let measure because of the special hardware, on the basis of our own experience, with its research before major problems. 
Most of what i refer to the content of deliberate experience, but there are beside it another aspect of awareness, which should be scientifically more easily accessible. 
One could investigate the consciousness of animals without regard to their content, and what happens studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly in the case of visualization. 
But with this approach, Christof cook and Francis Crick followed, it is about the neuralen korrelate awareness as the causal mechanisms. Both must be identical or not. 
Interestingly, it also stresses the importance of the prefrontal Cortex to visualization. 
What is now the feelings? 
I attribute it to the fact that an emotional system is activated like that fear in one of his own work conscious brain. 
What we call “fear” is the mental condition in which we are, if the activity of the system in the brain (or their consequences, how physical reactions) main memories occupies. 
In that sense feelings are closely tied to the regions of the Cortex, what distinguishes primates and especially people. 
Combined with linguistic nature fine gradations of feeling result, because we can distinguish categorize conditions and with the help of the words and grammar, in order to put them together with us to others. 
In contrast, for example, Antonio Damasio means that feelings emerge from more primitive activities in the sense of body parts of the Cortex and the brain stem similar Jaak Pankseep that focuses more on the brain stem. 
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not very much, it may well be involved in genericspreading feelings. 
Purely theoretically can not I disagree with that, but it seems unprovable. 
Pankseep argues, what with rats and people like fear it may seem to feel well in both cases so: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same if they behave like? 
A cockroach flees at risk if it too scared feels? 
In my eyes mere behaviour resemblance to show no experience equality. 
The neurale compared to help: Rats and people have similar brain cockroaches stems, however, not even a brain. 
But the brain stem is responsible for feelings? 
And even if they could prove to people: How did you want to prove it with rats? 
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), feelings. 
But I do not know how I should show.

By taking a flight tactic of space probes with which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a heavenly bodies, such as the earth. 
So the probes can save a lot of fuel. 
The euro-american research probe Cassini Huygens used this physical trick, like the solar probe Ulysses. 
The researchers, but for years surprises: The missiles are not behave 100-percent as one would expect it after the ancient law of gravity. 
Instead, there are irregularities in the pace. 
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower. 
So far the physicists could not explain this effect. 
They baptized it Swing through anomaly. 
Some experts fear that perhaps the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of governed by a curvature of the area could not be entirely correct. 
The American physicist Stephen eagle institute for Advanced Study from Princeton still believes strongly in that Einstein did not mistaken, to explain and seeks a Swing through anomaly assistance from the so-called dark covered the astronomers in space.

From the existence of the dark subject space researchers know only for ten years. 
From an apparently attractions, whose effect on other heavenly bodies can be observed. 
However, it is quite invisible, so it is sending and reflects an electromagnetic radiation, in particular, no visible light. 
According to the calculations of scientists, the dark subject still account for almost a fifth of the entire mass of the universe.

Obscure roads in the city, often forget and may soon to sell 
New York city has thousands of major roads, avenues, side streets and other by-pass roads, which some famous and others are only convenient. 
However, it is even experienced taxi drivers and local people in many years difficult to say where There is additional, simply because most have never heard of it. 
This tiny road is in the East Village and runs from the first Street lines between the north and Bowery Second Avenue, without achieving the Second Street. 
They are 30 foot wide and 120 foot long and look more like a dusty lane as after an active used passage route. 
There are no road signs. 
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard STR eating plan. 
The road is his admirers. 
For example, Avalon Bay, a building contractor, which recently luxurious buildings on the first established Street. 
It wants to pave extra Place in order to create a safe passage to the shops and fashion shops are expected in the new buildings. 
The other Verehrern neighbourliness for many years, which says, it is fascinated by the short lane, simply because it is one of the remains of the last of the building blocks. 
But the city administration department responsible and is responsible for the road for protection and construction of housing, does not want to receive it. 
During a meeting of the committee for land use of local councils in this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the street by building contractor. 
The committee that the road remains in the hands of the city, prefers and for a new plan asked to be presented next month, so Susan Stetzer, the district leaders in the municipal council 3. 
“Very little room left and we want in possession of the city that extra Place said further,” belongs to the city. 
“There could be offered for repairs and runs the road, which could be settled by Avalon, but we also want the public access is guaranteed.” 
Avalon Bay earlier announced that pave and setup to seat small road again, which is meant for a café, among other things, to which the company area lettings would like. 
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the streets, was made public for the first time during the meeting later this month. 
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that the company wanted to use the road, but it wants to do. 
“The main objective of the Avalon Bay is to be renovated this lapsed lane and made a public meeting place,” he said and added that the city had proposed the sale. 
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the department for building protection said that it was actually the desire of the city, which stressed road to sell and, to develop the task of the department was the real estate as to administer. 
Compared to its colourful neighbourliness The Bowery, maintain special Place some of its historic impression. 
Some believe that the road got his name in the year 1802, when a large farm, Philip Minthorne belonged among his many children was divided and a narrow strip country was claimed by none. 
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument, which was closed in the year 2006, opened the Place and the road is undoubtedly at best known as façade for the photo on the Cover of the album “rocks tons of Russia” from Ramones. 
The sticking plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, which had made the photograph in November's 1976. 
The road was full of scrap metal, rag and parts of barrels, Postern, leaves and ropes. 
Some people, including bloggers who write about the gentrification in the East Village, have the idea of selling by additional Place rejected that argument that the public property is modest, as it is to remain open. 
Others praised additional Rather than a rarity - a virtually unchanged cluster of the city, which in peace should be abandoned. 
Jeremiah Moss, which runs the blog called “Jeremiahs disappearing New York” (untertitelt with “the book of complaints: A bitter nostalgic for the extinction city”), issued a part of the discussion of the urban history on extra Place, which was published in the magazine “The New Yorker” in the year 1952. 
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: “Additional Place is a small close impasse, even during the day remains bleak and by rusty metal door of the storage rooms, closed at windows and rainwater gutters flying week-old newspapers last marked”. 
With a few exceptions, the road was just as recently as one evening. 
A rat went through the back part of the street, not far from the door, which had previously to CBGB, where a more expensive dress business. 
Graffiti has to be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottles was on the ground not far newspapers discarded by a fresh set of. 
Some passers-by said, they would have thought, but proposed rarely about additional Held that the road could be polished up slightly. 
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the attraction of the street in its current constitution. 
The best years of my life, said he was in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.

Bar rack's Obama's suggestions about education is a case in point. 
Obama's campaign referred to successfully conclude “the likelihood of afro American and Hispanic students school is lower than with white pupils”, which is right. 
In order to close the performance gap, Obama's education plan recommends a bilingual transition in training for those who learn English only particularly among others. 
The question for Obama is whether his commitment to the bilingual education, which focuses on education in languages other than English is contrary to their interests, reduce the gap in the school performance. 
We take a primary school as an example “Sixth Street Prep” in the eastern Los Angeles. 
The majority of the pupils are Hispanic and come from families with low income. 
More than a third pupils, many of which are only recently in the country, learn English. 
However, in 2008 astonishing 100 students of the fourth class insisted the state review in math at a good level. 
Similarly, surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year in the English review as good were assessed. 
This amazing success has been made in other ways than those who are preferred by Obama. 
The school Sixth Street puts its focus on review and exercise, constant monitoring of the knowledge and an attitude that do not tolerate exceptions. 
Furthermore, the school early practices, after which the training in an english-speaking environment. That is exactly the point that Obama has to consider, so the head mistress Linda Mikels. 
This approach stresses the almost exclusive use of the English language in the technical information. 
She Mikels who rejected the idea of bilingual education, told the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only just before from Mexico. 12 Months later, it has entered the classroom and him longer to see no. 
“It worked,” he said, “it worked for us.” 
Obama would take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools in much of Latin - American and other English to learning pupils? 
The performance of the school would make the answer to that question easy, but the educational positions within his own party (national Bildunsgvereinigungen support for a long time, the idea of bilingual education) and its own strong support of the bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain. 
While it agrees to the point that immigrants should learn English, it trivialisiert recently the subject of identification that people should stop, concerns about the legislation aimed at “only English” makes itself. 
Instead, he said: “You have to ensure that their child Spanish can”. 
Obama if it really wants to close the performance gap, he is to consider carefully education models that function, instead of her to despise and trivialisieren. 
The price of oil is falling due to renewed fears about the economy 
The price of oil is on Monday because of fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough the economy to encourage, fallen sharply. 
The crude oil option dealings with the New york commercial exchanges are in the morning session by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. 
Since last Monday price fell by more than $20. 
In the last two weeks, the commodities markets were shaken by both the financial turmoil at Wall Street and by powerful hurricanes in the gulf of Mexico. 
After prices had reached its peak of $145.29 per barrel July, they are in this month to almost $90 per barrel fell to rise again, as a result of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets. 
On Monday, investors have already shown concern, though congress representatives had announced that it over the weekend on a rescue plan had agreed to be the biggest in history. 
That message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from complete. 
As for the time being last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a report by government on Monday that Citigroup the banking Wachovia company to buy up. 
In the meantime, Belgian and Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis. 
After analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place and led to a rescue plan on the weekend, apparently failed to encourage the mood in the markets. 
Since the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including for oil, will continue to fall. 
Analysts at deutsche bank wrote in a report investors, the outlook for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates were very uncertain. 
We believe that continue to write them that the commodities markets will be affected. 
“From the perspective of the commodities markets, we are most concerned about it, whether American virus spreads to US throughout the world, especially in China.” 
The analysts bank downward correction, and lowered its forecast for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20% his expectations for the oil consumption due to the weak economic growth for the coming year. 
Team record by series in the second quarter aufgestellr 
Interior defender Shaun Ellis thought that he would have seen everything after he accumulated in the last eight and a half years more often than anyone in the jet jersey. 
Then he saw the second quarter on Sunday, in which the jets turned a game without result in a triumph. 
“I did not see,” said something like that ever Ellis. 
After a sloppy game between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals who responded to the bad weather, the second quarter began. 
But when Quarterback Brett Favre passport Lavernues arrived with a Coles 12-Yard-Touchdown, that marked the perfect start to one afternoon to its developing cooperation a giant step taken. 
Coles Favre found in this quarter for two Touchdowns, the times as a consultant for the defence slipped and the other a time of 10 seconds before the end of the half. 
“I did not work,” said particularly Coles about the passports to Coles went. 
“He is a superplayer. 
The vote was right, no matter what the people think.” 
While Favre and Coles catch played, the defense took Quarterback Kurt Warner apart. 
Advisor to defend Revis Darrelle intercepted a had an accident and turned him a 32-Yard-Touchdown. 
Libero Erik Smith came to a passport and intercepted. 
David Linebacker Bowens provided for a loss of Warner. 
The last ball loss, forced to Bowens, was probably the craziest. 
The Cardinal had the ball with 10 seconds remaining in the game conquered the jets the ball reconquered and Jay Feely, a 20 yard shot for 34 to 0 leadership. 
That was the most points the jets in a quarter had ever made. 
As he was asked to explain the madness answered Erik Mangini, the coach of the jets “the second quarter or the third quarter?” 
To answer both because the jets could reach 21 points in the third quarter too without one, said Mangini: “Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than third. 
A lot of points was within a short time.” 
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record 
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why him some of the best long-distance runner of all time to hold after he broke his own record in the Berlin marathon on Sunday, and people first became who created the distance of 42.2 km in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes. 
With the victory on the flat course at 2:03. Gebrselassie its previous result of 2:04 has 59: 26 by 27 seconds improves, which it had achieved last year in Berlin. 
Gebrselassie, 35, has its 26. World record in his varied career sets in which it achieved or set a world record one world cup title at a distance from a mile from the marathon at least. 
Last month, Gebrselassie the olympic marathon in Beijing, out of fear, which was then perhaps excessive that air pollution could aggravate his asthma problems. 
Instead, he registered for the match in Berlin. 
In almost ideal conditions, with sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the goal, Gebrselassie won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile. 
There since then course runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya on long hauls changed, are the record time for marathon in the last 10 years is about more than 2 minutes, while Ronaldo Costa made of Brazil in the year 1998 in Berlin the result 2:06: 05 won. 
After his victory on Sunday Gebrselassie told the press, he would have had and could not cramps in his calf two weeks ago, so one week not train. 
Obviously it is refreshed and not rusted not returned after recess. 
“I am so happy,” he said to reporters. 
“Everything was completely. 
I training a week ago and was still some doubts, but in the end it all super.” 
He was criticized for it, especially in Kenya, Ethiopia rival from East Africa, that it excessively orchestriert his racing runs, many world-best of marathon star generally it avoids, on the current leaders relies too much, as if it were a course race, and places world records on the match. 
But it hardly harms the size Gebrselassies as long-distance runner. 
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday Gebrselassie had the heart of the distance at 1:02. 04. 
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have Gebrselassie further provoke, after the pace producers had diminished. 
A little more than Gebrselassie made three miles off the complete his last start to separate from Kwambai to than second at 2:05. 36 and his record arrived by almost 5 minutes. 
Kamathi was third at 2:07. 48. 
With women Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now Germans, completed a remarkable year by her 2:19: the 19 seventh-fastest result of all time showed. 
The world record of 2:15: Paul Radcliff from Britain is 25. 
In the last spring was 36 years old Mikitenko surprisingly the London marathon at 2:24. 14 won. 
He missed the games in Beijing, because of problems that has been described as a back injury. But she recovered to win in Berlin and to improve its record in their third marathon about five minutes. 
It provided his skill, run by a quartet of runner within just let Ethiopian and Kenyan peel off, but ahead after 30 miles. 
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second at 2:21. 31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya as third at 2:25. 01. 
Pride and strains in the life of the black population, in a city of particular type 
Hidden among the excesses of the recreational parks in the periphery of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, away, a quiet city is loud and gigantic driving with pride and the complications of American culture Afro show. 
Eatonville, the first completely black city in the country and the hometown Zora Neale Hurstons, are no longer as easy to describe as Hurston it in 1935: “the city with 5 lakes, three croquet posts, 300 brown fur, 300 good swimmers, more than enough Guaven, 2 schools and no prison.” 
Today, it is a pilgrim. 
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and rubin Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival intend to Eatonville around the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance. 
And still remains the city, which describes it, and it to a tourist destination of the outing made by including it in the Florida tour guide produced in times of depression of federal writer project, in many ways a place of the special variety. 
Eatonville is as independent, mother and private as into the 1930ern when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to sharing their true thoughts on the white man “so little about us knows that he did not know what he escapes.” 
Even today, in a year in a black Präsidentschaftskanditat, senator Barack Obama, an open debate about race conditions calls, is that many here still suffering by outsiders to be closely monitored. 
“We are very much on it mindfully like our history are told” so Hortense Jones, 59, from birth at a resident town and community member of the oldest of town. 
It must be right.” 
Eatonville was defined as paradox of Triumph and the fight. 
It is both a historic example of the black movement and a community of nearly 2,400 residents, in which the poverty rate is twice as high as the state average. 
It is a focus of the literature and the other is an example, sometimes praised, sometimes condemnation of the black culture of rural south, which has its roots in the American slavery. 
It is not surprising that residents are both proud and on the hat. 
And the doubts really started to really Eatonville's image with Zora, as all Hurston calls here. 
She presented her hometown in books, and were written into dialect of hearts in the world, as “Mules and Men” (1953) and “Their Eyes were watching God” (1973) 
Five sales in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road through the often-forgotten center of Florida, leading to the scenes of black history and human tragedy. 
Impudently like Oskar both in real life and in literature, led Hurston reader to load of Eatonvilles first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then more private affairs. 
“Cold on the road to the left,” he wrote, “those brown, white painted modern school, with their alleged gardens and playgrounds, more than ever, the Howard Miller worries, although it is difficult to read and write.” 
She also mentioned the new leader of widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “drinks of any kind and sold as always hourly rooms suits.” 
In just a few hundred words Hurston did so with Eatonville self-government, however, with illiteracy, second marriage and sex. 
This was definitely not travel guide. 
Indeed, this was not a portrait, estimated by all. 
“Zora explained things, like it was” so the old 90-year Ella Dinkins, one of the John on the girls' Hurston perpetuated by quoting the men who sang songs on its beauty, full of sexual allusions was. 
He added: “Some people do not like this.” 
One remembers still Hurtson as a lively Exzentrikerin who returned regularly, after his family had drawn after Jacksonville, Florida. 
Augustus Franklin, 77, thought that if Hurston entered the city gebraust, it usually without warning did, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and trousers dressed in a city that today rather imagines himself on his venerable dress style. 
According to mr. Franklin most residents were fascinated, while many despised them. 
“The people are always happy to see Zora,” said James Franklin. 
But “it is never too long,” he added, but when it in his chair swung, on a terrace located on the rear that looks at the Sabelia lake where Hurston was probably baptized. 
As Hurston in 1960 was poor he died and their books made a mistake. 
Along with the majority of the world's Eatonville seem to have forgotten that. 
Although she was once a famous writer, a Zeitgenössin Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at barnard university in 1920ern, was buried in fort Impact, Florida, where he lived in an anonymous graves. 
In Eatonville there was no great ceremony, no public readings on a large scale. 
“I do not think that they understand their contribution to the world or their heritage in the slightest” Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows”, a biography on the Hurston that 2003 have been published. 
The move came in the 1980s. 
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace the Kennedy boulevard, the slow two-lane main street of the community. 
Orlan DOS of suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 on the western outskirts of the city. 
The proposal was presented when Eatonville still recovering from a difficult phase in its history. 
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community. 
In the 1950s against racial hatred compound brought into the community. 
“At this time, often a bunch of white boys and it came threw oranges and things on people who sit down,” said mr. Franklin. 
“There was even once it, a woman was killed. 
They threw a wassermelone from car.” 
In 1955 Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel analyzed the demand of the supreme Court to force integration by revealing its decision in the case Brown against the school council as “insulting instead of my race respect.” 
Residents say today that although the lifting of racial segregation was in some ways positive that the group cooperation in Eatonville and self-confidence of its young people weakened. 
“Black children were used to be embraced, I recall, one embraced his teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening,” N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the non-profit group for the protection of the Eatonville community. 
That may be so long received, he added, teachers and students no longer did not come from the same place. 
“We did not embrace its white teacher, because he was a white teacher, I believe there is a cultural divide,” said ms Nathiri. 
However, the civil rights have contributed to that place for further Zora Neale Hurstons was created, as it did black authors, performers and artists who jumped on themselves on prejudice, with positive self-confidence and statements as: “As someone can refuse to the delight of the society. 
I do not understand it.” 
In the year 1975 was the author Alice Walker nameless tomb towards Hurstons and began to revive her fame to fight. 
Five years later much-vaunted Hurston biography of Robert E was found at the Hemenway bookshelves, and made it a part of the American literature canon. 
The freeway project was precisely at a time when the Eatonvilles most famous daughter once again in the light of the public. 
And Hurstons saw this time old neighbours it as a savior. 
The community has begun to show at 1988 in the planning of a Hurston festival in the district of the construction of the highway was destroyed. 
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening vent two years later, and each January return many for the ceremony. 
Later, the district turned a few years away from its road-building plans. 
“The plans of a five-lane freeway encouraged the city, accelerated with top speed, has attracted real national pride,” said ms Nathiri. 
She Boyd put it more simply: “Zora saved Eatonville.” 
The victory against the freeway project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city. 
Came more and more as course-traveled Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who is here since 1993 into the church, and local people began last estimate again. 
Eatonville was included 1998 to the national historical record. 
A new one-story library (of course, named after Hurston) opened boulevard in 2006 at the again-paved and adorned Kennedy. 
Nowadays Eatonville is still a feature in Florida: it can sometimes feel only 6 miles from the city centre Orlan DOS like a Hintergasse in summer rain, as small as at that time as it of only 27 black families into the 1880ern was based. 
(It is now black to 90%.) 
Prominent in search of history Eatonvilles and its significance with caution are often still treated. 
For most interviews permission before necessary and certain things, as the wall of painting Eatonvilles of oldest church, which has been removed from the whites, and with the agricultural work is black men, to be allowed to be photographed. 
Many in Eatonville, like ms Jones, a courageous, self-confident teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that their shielded community is misunderstood. 
And yet, at the same time, the festival Hurston bigger was born, including a high degree of national pride. 
Mostly young people tend to look like Eatonville Hurston their entire race saw: fine, with all its problems, neither worse or better and equally proud, creative and diligent in a silly and mix as any other race and popular party in America. 
It is a genuine love for this city in which the voice of mr. Franklins can hear nephews, the old 18-year Edwin Harvey, intends to university to Eatonville to return to work in the city administration or at the police, which could do something to help it. 
And even the younger people, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from winter park, learned to describe Eatonville correctly. 
“Most people who go only here, will think: “Oh, this city is nothing compared with all the others,” said Alondra Kenon recently on a Sunday after the church. 
“But if we really ends and one moment in its history, it is a very beautiful city.” 
Here in New York talking fluid financial latin. 
At first glance, nothing has changed. 
If tourists in Manhattan from zeitungsständen and giant television screens in the Times Square kept themselves away, they would not play at all that they are in the midst of a debacle. 
They would never think about their heads in the schuhschachtelartigen offices in the glass facades, bankers and Hedgefondverwalter, which have a monopoly in New York daily the worst nightmare day since the fall of 1929. 
The suppliers are still with loud rattling the metallic tea balancing along sidewalks and carry on trays Muffins for breakfast meetings are loaded. 
Latinos shuffle still between housing about, such as human cargo pack animals, including the 50 ironed T-shirts who hang on a yoke-similar bar on their shoulders. 
Office workers still really waiting on the sidewalks finding dinner conditions for their breakfast SBA gelatine and there are still not possibly at a day between 16 and 19 a yellow taxi.

They money away from so-called Thrifts (little a construction company equals), loan banks and the local savings banks, which have branches in only one state, had taken and say that their clients such as family to treat. 
Last year, 15 of these banks went and quiet failure.

“I have the framework behind the scene, by their nature to”, Günter brewer, photographer. 
No sales, no frill, no costumes for the appearance. 
To get the nature of the great Flamencotänzer who do and devote themselves to the interpretation without the concentration in a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man. 
On the one hand, artists 
On the other hand, personality 
I look at private lives in these moments that are alien to the public, I know that when I for personality typical gesture that depth of a stolen view or express strength of those who are concerned because they will not enter the stage, can find. 
In its project “Flamenco people” represents the German photographer Günter farmer abwechselungsreiche Theatralik of some production on the stage with singer, dancer and guitarist. From this side it was known for artists just a few. 
With this proposal the photographer creates a special iconography of Flamencodarstellung at different levels. 
The exhibition, which belongs to the schedule for the month of photography of Flamenco, “reflects the importance of Flamenco, which continues to grow from day to day,” says the artist and makes clear that “Flamenco people” 'no man can be, but if you look at the photographs, then the viewer notices that there is not a typical images of artist on the stage. 
Ordinary people on the portraits are artist who are unable to stage passion, sadness, to reach and joy to move the public. 
In order to be able to hold the personality of these artists, you do not have to make photos on the stage. 
Her personality and its nature are in their hearts. 
That was interested in creating an atmosphere that would allow me, with a photo camera the characters of the largest Flamencomeister festzuhalten'. 
Farmer, inspired by the festival “Cante Minas de read”, made up of 1997 on a long journey to host singers, dancers Gitaristen or with a digital camera. 
Thanks to the picture assortment of the camera and the existing material, developed by images reminiscent of traditional photography. 
The application of different stylistic means destroys the traditional base of the picture, modernity and the idea, as the farmer understands Flamenco, are awarded to the picture: “Music with traditional roots, changed and every day surprises”. 
These are not only the dance, singing or the instrumental game, but the personality of the artist, his character, which entices with his art. 
The search for the essential for certain something that can be seen in the form of the hearing, Seins, and was the target of this work, which is presented very soon in the gallery of the El Fotómata. 
Prominent personalities in Flamenco including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others that are among the close range almost seventy artists who were photographed. 
The project has become an anthology of Flamencos as soon as book, with all the portraits of the exhibition, will appear. 
Bauers passion for the portraits led it to resume and as “portraits the veterans of the sport” realize this idea of two years ago once again (“SportARTproject”). 
Although the concepts of the project is different “Flamenco people” then the photographer 'gives it too much i like to host the people they know to learn and me in their lives constitution to shift, it is for a brief moment or a long time. 
I think that in the area of photography the portrait is the most difficult type. 
You meet or discover people, people who do not know sometimes at all, or they leave you for a few minutes alone, in order to be able to make a photo. 
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer I always try to do my ideas. “ 
The survey by the portraits of Flamencos today with the title “Flamenco people” will be issued in the gallery of the El Fotómata, and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules in the streets of la calle de la Mata. You can visit the exhibition by 16. 
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma, which he writes that “a risky”. 
He does not know where the action of the novel takes place and what it means there, however, Mario Vargas Llosa tried persistently the project to move forward on how it works, a novel about the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland, who lived in the Amazonengebiet drew twenty years in Congo. 
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival Hay festival Segovia, acknowledged the preferred Nobel prize for the project, which is occupied “a risky” and “everything indicates that it would not have to write a novel”. 
“If I would be prudent, I would not have made, but I will do it, and hope to end at some point the novel”, he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thought and words were exchanged. In the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.

“Sangre de mayo”: Hero book of Garci 
Inspired by “Episodios Nacionales” of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in “Sangre de mayo” represents a new version of the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the french. That is an admirable film in the Filmografie, with about 15 million euro investment for the shootings. 
In this way the Cineast has tried “a lot of people and social analysis to represent” what it always admired the works of the famous novelist, today Carci said at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the start of a long list of performers. 
“Sangre de mayo” with a film length of more than two and a half hours, was presented and shown later on the station Telemadrid than a four-hour mini series this Friday in cinemas. 
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós assures that, thanks to this shooting his “childhood dream” went into compliance. That it owes to Esperanza Aguirre, three years of the autonomous community Madrid assigned to turn a commemorative film on the second century ceremony at 2 November in Madrid. Above all, because the story was based on the basis of “Episodios Nacionales” who accepted the order. 
The overall contribution of 15 million, which was made by the autonomous community Madrid for shootings, offers Garci, he added, “the unique opportunity” by decorations and proper clothing the image of “entangled Spain who chose the wrong leader for the fight, because of the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinands VII behind the people was to represent.” 
But the Cineast that they could not count de Goya” (twice as high as with “Sangre de mayo”) on the financing as with “Alatriste” or “lot fantasmas, regrets that could some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel which Garci worked almost his entire career, not be. 
For this reason, Garci, who was also a director of film in “Volver” A empezar, attended by his usual function: it has on stage at performers, with whom we must first rehearse before it is beginning to look for those who did not Go ahead, it seemed “humiliating” and respect that, “a part of the occupation of the director of the film is to provide assistance in the theatre and the cinema in order to know what the cinema industry, where it is happening.” 
Many performers, whom it discovers de in “Sangre mayo” must go before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo. 
Garci, OSCAR candidate in four nominations (from which it won one), believes and assured that none of the three candidates who represent Spain before the Academy OF Hollywood in this year is a younger generation of the Spanish Filmographie. Neither “Sangre de mayo” or “Siete mesas de billar francés” and, ultimately, not the elected film “a lot of girasoles ciegos.” 
For this film Garci does not expect awards. 
“At the beginning you work for descendants, believe later you say that it is only for a prosperous, and you are happy if they produced”, declared a film Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity. 
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia 
A Flamencotänzerin from Seville admires a dancer, also from Seville the strain. 
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: their father was a catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), it was born in the quarter of Triana and as it was three years old, her family moved to London. 
She was a dancer and an expert on eastern danced. 
It was an exciting life, it was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of women, like Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt. 
It was Buddhistin, vegetarian and set for the abolition of the corset that limited free female movement. 
The life of the woman who left its mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón. 
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and her to me this role proposed what i seemed impossible.” 
“We try not to talk about their lives, let us separate their ESPRIT to preserve,” said the Flamencotänzerin. 
Their dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco. 
“The dance of butterfly” seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or “the dance of the queue like” tango. 
She was dancing sensuous and told me that i told her dancing in this area aesthetic liegt'. 
The production is extraordinary cooperation on two: with Miguel Poveda, which will sing again for Isabel with one of his ideas, as he did it in “La puerta abierta”; and with Flamenco Meisterin Matilde Coral, who wanted to work together, except for one of its ex-pupils. 
'Tórtola Matilde plays a very mature personality. 
I am happy, because she has agreed to participate in my work and I feel very interesting. “ 
The production is counting on musical composition and Gitaristen Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, on the song of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa al Viola and cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, “the role of the companion of artists who were Divas, transfers to whom it again and again in love.” 
In this one is in a certain way of life of the woman who in places like India, located as far as we know, the United States or Russia and also in the whole of europe, although it normally lived in London. 
“I wanted to withdraw it, because I believe that it is out of the women, a huge influence on a certain age and their work today, none more so and even less estimate know,” said Bayón. 
The idea is taking place at 20:30 in the theatre Lope de Vega. 
The publication of the book “Diario de un poeta recién casado” also includes Triennium 
The presentation first edition of “Diario de illustrated UN poeta recién casado” in st. Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia, offer an appropriate atmosphere to implement planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian council for culture to celebrate the “Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón” (2006-2008). The goal is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the death of the two. 
So, “the Triennium is completed by Zenobia and Juan Ramón” with the new edition of the work of the international congress, which will take place in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez Zenobia and with the itinerant exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: “Aquel opened chopo de luz”, those in the Can and, after which it was, and is presented in the process of the international congress now New York in various places in andalusia. 
The Andalusian council for culture also received eight hundred copies of “Diario de un poeta recién casado”, published and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez Enciso by Pedro Tabernero. The goal is to become more aware of the person and work for Andalusian world poet. 
The united states can not imagine Paul Newman badly 
Sometimes ` God creates perfect personalities. 
Paul Newman was one of them. “ 
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with him in “tabloid reporter”, and then the idea of the american cinema, which left out in the cold, and was followed by came from all of America to Newman with his inspiring idea. 
Just exhibition, which cost him the OSCAR to give. 
And as 2007 withdrew. 
And he knew that it was very ill. 
That was a major blow for all. 
“It sometimes feels is a much more than one, and now I have a great friend lost,” said Robert Redford crying, “my life and my country were the biggest quaintnesses of his life.” 
None were afraid to either embrace ridiculous or exaggerate. 
When “father” of the cinema and the native country when he is a sad moment died in fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in that the depressed self-esteem of the Americans in the desperate search for reasons would recover. 
If this hard time without virtue only a few people who can be admire, remain, one must be not necessarily Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman. 
For all anchored it almost a Platonic ideal of beauty and the truth. 
He was officially enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered losses, like other both also profits: from the foundation, the fight against drugs used up and in honour of his son from the first marriage, who died at overdoses, one based on its own brand of home and organic products. 
All this is a gift to the country in which it cost so much trouble, against a deadly food culture to prevail. 
A huge wave of surprise raids on Hollywood decisively irrespective of nationality and citizenship. 
The latest James Bond, who confirmed Englishman Daniel Craig, that people did not die, but the whole era. 
The Englishman Sam Mendes, director of film and OSCAR winner, said that the work with Newman was not less or any more than the point of his career. 
Russell Crowe, who bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration. 
“The biggest one of us left us all,” confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dared to try to live like Paul Newman lived: high standards at the honesty, a reliable private life, far from the cameras. 
That is not easy or not always in today's media jungle. 
But there is someone who tried it, and Paul Newman was an example of this. 
It has a separate brand and was married there after fifty years with Joanne Woodward, it was faithful to who, although there were not many opportunities to be. 
“I should eat a Hamburger on the street, if I have at home fillet of? ” he often joked. 
In the sky will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same views as its fans who in America is not necessarily the case. 
“Of all major roles he played, none has been as proud of it as the faithful spouse, loving father, the attention Grandpa and those of the philanthropist”, he said. 
For the Olympic Games the roads are poorly in Madrid. 
However, perhaps, the dream of many of us is to organize some olympic disciplines in Madrid after the failure of 2012 to 2016. 
But I wonder: “We are ready for it?” 
Yes, we follow the example of the old roads, I say that it is not true. 
It was called, and my assessment after that was so perfect street it the worst street with everything and to which gave him. 
A lot of rubbish, if you would consider the evaluation and I could consider it, saying it would not go through something like that. 
However, we go through everything from the outset. 
Nonsense begins with the ticket getting that allows you to go first. 
It does not seem to be bad myself, but if they let go, then they should give you all (including chip to avoid the congestion on the road). 
After all not. 
Here they let you only get the ticket (the first nonsense, which is only going there) and (there after an infinite queue) is the surprise! The T-shirt existed only in the size of “S” (a second nonsense, because I need the crowd XL) 
Where do we live? 
Or is it like that, after the crisis decided only small to buy much cheaper shirts from less material? 
Well, things like these are a small matter compared with the days on the streets. 
Apart from the fact that we have to go very soon to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes, but you have to let the backpack. 
Waiting for more than 35 minutes took what is incomprehensible in the event of a road, where 11,000 people are expected. 
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road began had let our backs bags and we are not even if had succeeded, but to bring back would be even more difficult. 
He also sought to organize in those 40 minutes waiting period as rain, so that it came to the temptation, a popular uprising and attack the little house. 
I believe that morning some 500 people pneumonia will certainly have and some as I do because of this chip, which I have with the expulsion of are not even in time, I can imagine that the outcome was wrongly branded. 
Of course, if you ask me for a perfect road traffic, it would never happen to me. 
So I think we still far from a city will dream, which is well - prepared for the Olympic Games 
Microsoft in search of (virtual) a Rezeptionistin 
On the “Emergence Technology Conference” ALSO engineer from Microsoft, on the progress of the new image detection system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is able to repay some primitive tasks such as a taxi order (or, in the case of Microsoft that is a tour planners to move on the campus of the company). The system is considering what is in the entertainment. 
Thanks to a camera and a form and a face identification system, this “Rezeptionistin” can see how many people in the area who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and the watchwords of their entertainment understand. 
It can also make those present after the talks in the groups. 
In presenting the video “Rezeptionistin” plays a third person, but she understands that this person is not related to the group, which holds in their conversation, and that no firm employee is. 
The question whether the person wants and answers to visit anybody here that she will soon follow. 
All without the blue screen SHOT 
Impressive 
That is certainly the future. 
Now the company is better things that we can focus, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system. 
It was this week very superficially about the change of strategy of Microsoft. 
Windows 7 will be faster and not that many involved programs. 
Steve Ballmer said that if the computers would be equipped with the most necessary, instead of filling it with the commercial rubbish, five times faster would work. People, steven, it will be only a few. 
There is only one opinion, considering that Microsoft added another function and “extras” in Windows versions or. 
The change of direction is worth 
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing in importance, just like the software. 
When Google appeared chromium in the net, that was a part of the theory that it was the first step of Google, in order to compete with Windows. 
Sent many pointed out that the browser is not an operating system. 
The operating system when an indispensable part will always be necessary, so that hardware and software can work at the same time. 
The operating system meets the work that can be compared with the work of his wife and her husband when it comes to inform his mother-in-law. 
That is true. 
The system will never go away, but you have to his death “,” does not reflect an absolute, but as a relative truth. 
Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea. 
People are always less attention to the operating system, the more the Web browser. 
The computer is just beginning to get around the Firefox, the Explorer or chromium and every day we spend more time at surfing than the environment of the “windows”. 
What is half in the computer of existing applications serve? 
Less is more 
And Windows 7 must more compactly, many more than its compactly Vista. 
More easily, did not exaggerate, less complicated. 
The interest of Microsoft is more to integrate its online services as an alternative to Google eventually become. 
In reality they undoubtedly need that. I have a small example. 
I made a photograph of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation areas for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month. 
On the soft drinks dispenser a sign is moored: “Your search. Our future.” It prints a request to use their own tools for online search. 
In the year 2006, an independent study came at the end of that at Microsoft, Google for searches in the net used the 66% workers. 
Moreover, last week was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is lagging behind. 
It will not appear at the beginning and end of 2009, rather than 2010. 
Microsoft is looking at the possibility of launching Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time on the mark. 
The telephone every day is turning into a computer. 
That android and iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost. 
Le Fabuleux Marcel 
Pablo Picasso, wore pinches Leonardo di Caprio had this time in “Blood Diamonds” by Edward in Costa Azul, exactly the same as Al Pacino in “the godfather” by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it is a clothing and construction minister. 
If we start the countless star appearances to list, then we can go back to the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, which had raised heavyweights in a travelling circus. 
Basically, that is sleeveless and tailliert typically male T-shirt from cotton. 
The english-speaking people call it “tank”. Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands. 
First of all, because of its great name, although it is mentioned in the narrow circle “Marcel.” The legend tells the name emergence is linked to the lover of singer, Edith Piaf strain in sports and by the boxer Marcel Cerdan. 
“La Marcel” towers mainly because of its outstanding cotton, because of its distinguish Unisex cut and is marked by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as much at the neck cutout. 
And attention, the Belgian company is focused not only on the production of “tanks.” 
They have also college Sweatshirts, boxer Retro, Cardigans and Kaschmire, trousers from cotton, T-shirt with strip babies, short Shorts 
And modelled consents underwear. 
Although it is regrettable to use it as Unterbekleidung. 
They are very attractive. 
“I want to be a young mother; the candidate, I do not worry” 
Their big appearance with her sister, prevented him not to build their own personality. 
Mónica Cruz is delicate, but full enjoyment of life. 
Currently, brothers and sisters Gruz take their new activity in the fashion very seriously. 
For Mónica that is much more than a few rich and beautiful girls who maintain its reputation. 
It was moved in Paris with the promotion of the company Mango, since its establishment and also makes the presentation of the most important contributions in the way that the Spanish fashion house sponsors. 
Compassionately and shyly, winner of the short distance. 
Tell us what you do in Paris. 
I came to the new collection for this autumn/winter season, my sister and I Penélope for Mango designed to present my presentation of the second edition of “Mango Fashion Awards” visited and at the Dinner with Valentinos took credit. 
A very hard work, which is at the same time exciting. 
They work for the Spanish house, which is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango? 
My sister, both as I have the cinema and of the 1960s 1950s fascinated; we find many ideas. 
I would like to go through a city women and see how they are dressed as their clothes to combine, often make it. 
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you have a very diverse woman is not true? 
I believe, but in the end, everything is in these areas and has many similarities. 
Since I was a child, I was excited by the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around the dress cabinets of my aunt and see their clothes. 
That was super to be even better than in a recreational park. 
Even later than dancer, I tried to pay attention to the clothing. 
You know, we must dancers so far have our own style in teaching and with the samples in order to look at mirrors and to feel like us well. 
When one shifts actress, if you get the costume, into the real actor role. 
Finally, everything is combined, it is like a lot of respect for the costume designer and professionalism. 
Recently, did you, you have no crisis fall to 30? 
Oh. 
I feel better than ever, than thirty years I feel well. 
I think the woman will come, experience and can live with fewer mistakes. 
I am not afraid because of my biological clock. 
I have made the things that were already low since I, whom I wanted to do and that was very happy home. 
So, you remember to become mother or not? 
For a long time, I know that I will be mother, because that my body and I want to be a young mother; that I want to escape not. 
What is the candidate, because I do not care about me. 
I will make and educate them with a lot of love, very lucky feelings for my children. 
As for the film art, you keep in mind the work, in which you were involved and what was turned last year. 
Exactly the same, and I would like to see they are presented to the public. 
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, is very impatient and jerkily and everyone wants to have at once, which of course not immediately can be. 
I wish that “La are for the first time set última hora” and “EN busca de la tumba de Cristo.” 
Some see as you toppled 
The other day did you seem, will vote on the run with stairs Naomi Campbell that? 
Is good, do not say anything like that. 
It is not so I went on the run stairs, too modeln. 
Naomi Campbell, which I know for some time, and called on London simply invited me to take part in a parade for the charity meeting of the organization “women for a better world” and the clothes, we show. I know that two clothes from our collection of Mango were auctioned to collect money for Naomis NGOS. 
People do not know Naomis good heart. 
Many things are told about it. I, as the person who knows it, would say that they are not right. 
However, I will support this good thing, in which it is involved. 
He asked me to participate in the parade for a noble cause, but if it comes and asked me to do, I will do that. 
In order to support women in the third world, which is also necessary. 
The drivers who because of the alcohol level to become backdue can become the “Alco close” to install. 
The authority is that the driver who had three official penalties because of alcohol in his car installs this system, which it forbids starting in the drunken constitution car. If it is under the influence of alcohol, the car did not start. 
The initiative in the last month reported June and have been a part of the report that attorney general sheep is already. According to his information, it is a pilot project, which will be for one year. 
The purpose is the Resozialisierung of the driver, why this gets a course for the re-education of conduct in traffic. 
But the chief prosecutor, according to experience in the Ministry of Transport and the foundation of the technical institute for security of the cars will participate. 
Set taxes, according to statistics, between 30 and 75% the driver, who was displayed on more than one occasion for driving under the influence of alcohol. 
The “Alco close” to prevent that, because it is a system with the car, it measures the alcohol content in breathed out air and prevents autostart when the driver made alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is established, which is higher than allowed. 
It costs more,000 euros, the cost of that to over 1, which makes the sanction. 
In this context, a study carried out by the united states at 2007, showed that with these devices equipped cars already stop in the first year after its introduction to 65% of the violations. 
In Spain, one expects annual 115 lives could be saved. 
The measure is limited to the administrative penalties for two reasons: to tackle this conduct before it becomes a crime. 
And in order to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform in the normal way can be implemented, and a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the prosecution process. 
Even the equipment on the Spanish markets, but no business is available, although it has been built into some commercial vehicles and vehicles of public transport. 
Just tomorrow, the Lower House will vote socialist labour party, which proposes crew this system in school buses because of the initiative that Spanish. This has already been made in France. 
In Mexico, and without “peep toes” 
With British punctuality, at 17:40 clock, by which time, which was planned by the program, landed the presidential hangars airport Benito Juárez de México DF alongside the flight of the Spanish Air Force, with the prince and princess of Asturias went. 
The sun went down, but their jets still forced to use the hand sun screen in order to see the royal couple that came out of the plane. 
Directly to passenger-loading stairs: the Spanish Ambassadors and other authorities 
A couple of hours before I a taxi driver on the street asked whether he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias visited the city in order to formalise the official visit. 
Ah, as well, so you can not make people forward at the airport by this time you  is here or   like that 
No, it is the spaniards, but there were a few years ago. 
"Oh so well 
But the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and travel knows. 
There are many who are waiting in the hangar at the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 soldiers from the navy, the official salvo delivers. 
The prince is dressed in smiling navalblue, and the princess, as long as the wind blown hair, without peep “normal” toes, may have been told that he expects a thunderstorms in DF. 
Before they enter the chamber, smiling and they are prepared for the photographers, in which the official crews waiting. 
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter of the Mexican television for her who makes willingly jokes, waiting. 
The best Premium the fashion 
Probably there was no place in the world as Paris to present a Premium the fashion and it probably has not significantly outstanding fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino. 
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition “el to Bóton Mango Fashion Adwards” for the promotion and international growth of recent language skills. 
This is awarded interest on loan of EUR 300,000.

In the vicinity of many famous people, the vorstandstisch organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular. 
Nati, with a heavy heart, which was broken by the pain because recently his brother died, tears themselves together. He suffered and some wore ELAH jewelry of the suit the fashion house, which was breathtaking.

In the sleep talk 
Some children speak at night 
I do not believe those who wake up and tell us something, what happened on the day before it, but the children who speak during the sleep. 
If it happens you for the first time, in the best case, it will be shocked, but the reality is not important. 
That is a positive sleep disorder called speaking to sleep. 
It is more common, especially with the children and young people. 
To be sure, more than one of you were told that spoke at night. 
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (a brand in life, for example, with high fever), or regularly (each day, once a week, once a month ), the next day the child can not remember. 
There is no reason that causes the phenomenon. 
Often links with other phenomena in sleep being sought, looking at night like nightmares, fearing that panic-stricken Enuresis noctura (would bed-eat at night), speaking to sleep, but there is no reason for it. 
As we said earlier, it can be very high fibre, stress situations or excessive demands. 
In any case, it is a little researched phenomenon. 
The frequency with which it is highly variable. 
It may be that they speak calmly in different words, whispers or it can quite the opposite be (cries, wines, long discussions ). 
In cases where it is very hard, advocates, to monitor and be dealt with a specialist child to investigate whether a problem that fear and will play in this way. 
We have said that it is a positive disruption, so it will not have to deal with it, they are sleeping with a nuisance, be treated can (for example, where sleep Apnoe or with the stress). 
What we can do is, a series of simple preventive measures: 
Do not try the child before sleeping on outrage. 
Select and stressful television avoid, calm game for the children who are too wild terribly and somewhat. 
With the nervous children who are relaxations detente recommended methods can be used to make in order to help them, some internal peace. 
That helps to sleep child calmly. 
When speaking to sleep occurs, peace is trying to preserve. 
He thinks that it is safe and will be able to the next day it of anything out of the child, what happened. 
Useful advice 
Do not give it up. 
It is useless because the child is unconscious, then it from their sleep will knock. 
Although the child, he sleeps, so it is based. 
Remembers when it points to a pair phenomena frightened, it is to be discussed or to find out the child for the fear is that reason. 
If they understand what says (it is not as usual), does not put pressure on the child not to carry out a hearing and to find out more information. 
So this is nothing to achieve will not, because if the child sleeps, is unconscious and to think. 
However, you will hear what he says, but it will not know what dreams and why says it, so they are cautious about the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that you learn from it. 
Perhaps, it tells the child not to hear what at night and his secrets to know. 
Not even as a joke. 
Many fear causes. 
So, you do not care, there is nothing wrong, that is a moment to take only a few minutes. 
Finally Illhäusern… 
After a long period of limited circumstances Illhäusern on the pitch is finite success. 
Without much effort erspielten themselves the many people yellow-black gateway opportunities and managed to turn to win and so the game. 
The pace of this meeting, where the attackers had trouble to show their skills was not very high. 
After the first attack on the guest captain Kauffmann, whose remote shot passed close to the spot, Illhäusern easily should dominate the game, and he has managed to only alternating Fonderflick with a remote shot, with a brain high-pass Romain, and with a shot at the tip of the foot to provoke the protection against Denmark. 
The opposing team blocked in the feldmitte and allow only the loud Riahi at the top of the storm. 
The start of the second half should be decisive in the first two by temp-oral Riahi and fought for gate opportunities, and soon after the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais was exactly right to accept a ball, which was rejected in a first attempt by thief old. 
But the illhäusische goal scorer should be able to enjoy a lucky not long ago and twelve minutes later on the bank be sent, and his team comrades were at stake numerically inferior. 
Denmark but did not use this and set illhaeusischen eleven no major problems in which only slightly, withdrew its defense “consolidates”, except in the final seconds of the game in which the ball passed after a big mess very close the slat. 
Sarkozy is furious Fishermen 
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a difference in Brittany.

The peninsula Quiberon was defined by a barrier. 
On Monday the sailors of their commitment expressed by burning from the early morning at tyre and pallets before the fuel depots in the port of Brest and Lorient, while in Concarneau or Saint Brieuc demonstrations were held. 
The movement for extended to other ports in the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, like Sables D 'in Olonnes Vendée, where the fish cutters did not carry out or Le Havre, where some twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant vessels. 
Fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening. 
From Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the process of the meeting on Wednesday in the Ministry before deciding on possible measures. 
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the Ministry of agriculture and fisheries in Paris planned debate. 
But some bretonische Fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement. 
“The strike will continue” because “Fishermen will not want to Paris to go”, announced in no position to” and “for example Liliane Cariou, president of the committee of Lorient. 
Employment fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel, the cost of litres currently about 50 percent, but they think that the limit of profitability of a boat can only be achieved with Diesel for less than 30 cents per litre.

Obama, winner of points in the first TV debate 
After the first debate of the two candidates for the white house on Friday followed a continued to find out who followed the winner from it, John McCain or Barack Obama. 
As expected, announced the QGs of both the republican and the democrats their own victory in this television debate, which should be followed by a third of American families. 
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although very much, not enough was “brilliant” to stop in order to make it possible for the decline in the election five weeks before the presidential elections. 
The institute Gallup, on Saturday, a poll published that Obama with five points is appropriate (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the democrats demonstrates the better figure. 
With the still indecisive voters, those on which it is now, Obama with 39% came out as a winner in the polls, but according to an CBS poll, 25% of them McCain see winners. 
Obama should be able to confirm its lead on Thursday with the good performance, which is expected to its competitors, Joseph Biden during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin, 
` It would be a mistake to underestimate them. 
It has good Instinkte', warned, however, this weekend, Bill Clinton. 
The seventy-year old McCain has not stopped moving its undeniable experience in the area of foreign policy priority clearly and underlining the “naive” of his opponent on these issues, which was the focus of this first TV debate. 
“Senator Obama does not seem to understand that…,” he stressed several times. 
“I think they are not that senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge about president”, he assured. 
A position that is preached since yesterday in republican election advertisements. 
Obama has stressed that he represents the future. 
He spoke briefly and accurately, without being able to be moved from the version. 
He moved his ability to make good decisions and the image that has the world of the United States to renew. 
“McCain yet understood for Obama, however, set for this weekend, a democratic election advertisements against it, in which republicans was charged, not the full extent of the crisis to have taken the burden on the “American road.” 
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain wore to say a lot of things about me, but nothing about you,” Obama prangerte yesterday 20.000 people who had gathered at an election rally in north Carolina in pouring rain. 
He did not even mention the words “middle class” or “workers”. “The financial crisis provides a clear advantage for Obama, most likely to consider the Americans to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss. 
“The next week could represent a major turning point” yesterday, estimated the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer. 
The democratic representative cream Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared the “good economic instincts” Obama's with those from Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis. 
For the democratic candidate for the current crisis is “the end of an eight-year bad economic policy, which has been implemented and supported by senator McCain by George Bush.” 
After he had reiterated that it would probably even manage to reduce taxes for 95% American despite the volatility of Wall Street said the senator from Illinois on the fact that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, together with the introduction of a health insurance system, would have a top priority for it. 
McCain against it wanted to build a plant from 45 nuclear power plants to 2030.

“Credit you notice that in Minsk an election took place?” 
Youth and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday at the main square of the belarusian capital in order to reject in advance the results of the parliamentary elections. 
Several hundred belarussians met Sunday evening since closure of the polling stations in the market place in Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections. 
Although no result was announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: “The dictator is to withdraw.” 
Some say that they did not vote at all. “What is that, if they make eh with my voice, what he wants,” says a young person. 
They do not believe that the regime that reflected the foreign observers in the best light, in order to resume negotiations with the EU is prepared to carry out a democratic change. 
The sanctions, including the Nichterteilen visas for 40 senior belarusian personalities and Aufeislegen of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were estimated the observers as clean. 
According to the opposition, they were not there. 
“We have been excluded and our observers were not allowed by the parliamentary committees to participate in the count,” regrets Yuri Potemkin, press spokesman for the union of democratic forces, heterogeneous union of twelve parties. 
This is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexander Milinkiewicz, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-european movement, because it is important, who is counting the votes, and that is the executive. 
If members of the opposition strike in parliament, because they were appointed, and not elected. 
But their arrival in the parliament can mean air time on TV, sitting in the regions and parliamentary bills. “ 
The opposition is a duty to intervene in the political game because 'dialogue with the European union must be opened. 
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted, into a crisis, Russia and we do not reform ourselves, we risk, a protectorate of Russia. 
Now, we are independently sein'. 
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and cooperation in Europe, which followed the election course of events does not recognize the election. 
He stressed that the turnout figures seem too high and that the expansion of the votes in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) paved the way for any kind of manipulation. 
Credit 'you notice that the election was held? the leader of the Social Democrats asks Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners who were released during August this year. 
In the polling stations were no one. 
And a maximum of five members of the opposition will be in the parliament, those who are most likely to comply with the views of the government. “ 
The silence of the night lowers again on the October. 
On television president Lukachenko and members of the central election commission congratulate themselves to their success. 
Discussion of the blood that have again safe 
Hema yesterday Quebec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its creation, and its president, dr. Francine Décary, had to be happy all because Hema Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world. 
And, above all, it regained the confidence of the public, which had been badly shaken by the scandal of the contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s. 
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the donation service of the Canadian red cross were during the 1980s with HIV and hepatitis the C-virus contaminates. 
In light of this tragedy and the dissatisfaction of the public, the government of Canada launched a public, by the judge Horace Krever led investigation, which had the aim to bring to light into the circumstances which led to such a tragedy to prepare and guidelines for February 1994 if another disaster of this kind to prevent. 
While judge Krever still hesitated to issue its report at that time, several provinces have put a committee on the ground, whose aim was to build a new system for the administration of units of blood in Canada. 
In Quebec Gélineau committee met this order. 
After the reports and Gélineau Krever in Canada two blood banks were created. Hema Quebec, responsible for Quebec and Canadian blood company to supply the other provinces and the two territories. 
'1998 when Hema Quebec started its work, barely 38% of the people had confidence in the unity of blood system in Quebec, remember dr. Décary. 
The situation was disheartening. 
The huge efforts to ensure the security of the units of blood to improve and the work in this area during the next few years, we have the confidence of the public zurückgewonnen', telling them before they stress that proudly now almost 94% percent of the population of quebec Hema confidence in Quebec had early 2008. 
Dr. Décary keeps but knowing that “confidence is something very fragile.” 
Since its inception, at 28 1998 September Hema Quebec acts according to the principle of caution. 
At this time, we have seen the appearance of numerous cases of human variant of mad cow disease in Europe, a new kind of creutzfeldt-jakob disease, telling the woman who holds the line since the creation of 1998. 
'And we did not have any idea about whether the blood will be transferred to the disease. 
It was one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which it uses exclusion measures, if you do not know that, if an illness is progressing slowly, as it is clear that calls by degeneration of the brain, which will inevitably lead to death by creutzfeldt-jakob disease. 
They did not accept donations from people who had not given 1980 more than a month in the united kingdom April 1999. 
Now, a few years ago it was clearly demonstrated that the disease is transmitted through blood. 
So this event showed that the principle of caution that we would use is quite a sense. 
1999 appeared on the market, a much more accurate technology for the detection of HIV: The nucleic acid test (service), which make it possible to prove directly in the blood of donor the appearance of the virus and not the antibody against the virus, as it was in the tests used so far. 
The service has made it to shorten the incubation period those between the time that the people were infected and for that, if the first viruses can be demonstrated by our techniques in blood, explaining the specialists. 
This time could be reduced to a period of less than a week. 
So the risk that certain donors could be infected, without knowing it, and one that is not recognize could not substantially reduced. 
These improvements made it possible to reduce the risk of transfer payments on a blood transfusion in large measure. 
Nowadays, from 12 million people a risk to receive with HIV infected blood. 
', In other words, this means that we would have to distribute 12 million units of blood, before someone was infected with HIV. 
Since Hema Quebec distributes each year between 400.000 and 500.000 units of blood, it would take more than 24 years before it happens when HIV through a unit of blood to transfer. 
I think we can probably feel today, if you get or using a blood transfusion around the health wiederherzustellen', means the management Hema head of Quebec. 
'Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the security of our products. 
One never knows the pathogen can arrive in the system. 
Only last year on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus appeared, which is exactly the same as the west Nile virus transmitted by insects through the blood. 
We must constantly überwachen', continue dr. Décary before they stress that Hema Quebec alongside a safe to provide an adequate supply must make available. 
'The need arises, as the population ages. 
Since the treatments are more aggressive for cancer patients, often need new red blood or blood corpuscles panels. 
Ageing populations also affects the blood donor network, which averaged only 3% belong to donations the appropriate inhabitants of quebec. “ 
Each healthy people aged 18 years or and fairness that meet criteria to every 56 days, to six times a year, blood donations. 
14% Of the people who make their blood, are not accepted, on average, because they are infected with AIDS and malaria, for example, and to a country went where malaria is common, for one year from donations is excluded. 
'With these 3% we manage to an inventory, which meets the needs of the hospitals. 
Lack of reserves are extremely rare. 
But we need to renew the members of the donor network when they are older and no more blood to donate. 
It is difficult to convince the people to donate blood, above all, to keep them and bring it to regular donors. 
Life is now so hectically that you find the time rarely, an hour with blood donation too verbringen', regrets Francine Décary. 
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars Hema Quebec does not only produce units of blood, but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, used almost exclusively with heavy fire injuries. 
This tissue are under investigation, and worked on frozen, before they are stored temporarily with Hema Quebec, the only public umbilical cord blood bank of quebec administered. 
In the umbilical cord that sooner than biomedical waste was considered, rich blood, which can be used for it is serious diseases, such as leukaemia, to treat on stem cells. 
` Several weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood test, and we plan to develop a year more than thousand. 
“We should start well at the beginning of next year to make it available for transplants, continue to declare dr. Décary who describes this program the umbilical cord blood decline as very popular. 
“Many mothers are believed to have no access to it” because Hema Quebec lack the resources to offer this complex and costly program in all hospitals of quebec. 
Football - Slap in the semi-final 
Montreals Blow has yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1-victory (4 to 3 with all the gates) against the Sounders from Seattle to second and will play in the quarter final series in the Saputo stadium, where the total gate relationship predicted that half of the final round of the elimination games of the first league of the USL qualified. 
The midfield player Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth play minute. 
After a first half without gateway for both the people and on the other side, the midfield players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other takes on the formation Montreals. 
Roger Levesque was the only person who has matt to Jordan for Sounders along the way. 
We remember that in the first game Vor-und return match series was at 2 for the Starfire Complex on Friday in Tukwila Kick in a suburb of Seattles 1-defeat. 
In the semi-final Blow with the Whitecaps from Vancouver will measure. 
Saturday evening could hire a 3 for Donner in the return match in Minnesota to 1-deficit by 4 to 3-victory, but the Whitecaps drew with a total gate relationship between 5 and 4 in the final round. 
Blow will probably have face Friday and Sunday the Whitecaps, but the details of the game series are now set. 
In short, victory by gateway Kovalev 
The number of 1-trio Canadian team is ready to start the season. 
Last night advanced the unity of the attack on the panthers from Florida with a storm fire, formed by Alex Kovalev, Toma Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn, which led to a 3 to 2-victory. 
Kostitsyn, the star of the meeting, shot a gateway, Plekanec delivered two proposals and Kovalev turned a passport in this victory, the fourth Tricolore in six preparation games. 
Kovalev scored a victory by shooting the only goal of the shooting. 
'I am not ready yet, warned the Russian. 
I need another game, so I feel at home. “ 
` It set out in the first half, said Guy Carbonneau too much. 
But I think he is the end of the game. 
He received stormy applause. “ 
Charest relies on the north 
The prime minister does not rule out to begin before the end of the year. 
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was in the end, Jean Charest went after Jean talon in Quebec, where the new minister of health Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to today's teilwahl to be elected yesterday. 
“The process of our last major border in the north shift”: This is the long-term goal presented Jean Charest yesterday with visual resources at the general assembly of the liberal party of quebec in Levis, and he followed the guidelines entirely. 
During his speech behind it a kind of picture mill was projected. 
On three huge screens spectacular images swept through hydro-electric power plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in “Google Maps”, maps, etc. 
Big money in the legislature. 
Compared to the press, the prime minister, by the way, not only that it will keep the elections this autumn, although he said that his timetable was very full. 
The plan “north” is the fourth element of a “vision” that the prime minister for allegedly Quebec, a “new economy”, which provides for an agreement with France relative workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario. 
Although she has often said recently, in the words of the prime minister, the opening of the north, the northern region on the 49sten degree of latitude, had never been subject to a presentation. 
The prime minister was limited to explain why the north was “a jewel with enormous potential”, but no date, no investment sums or exact priorities for future projects. 
At the most some views on this, that more could be done: Particularly at the hydroelectric power, at the forest, but especially in the mining sector, favoured by the growth of developing countries and the renewal of the public infrastructure. 
Listing Mr Charests according to the north “nickel, copper, zinc, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond” has. 
This “area twice as France” 'is as much in the vicinity, is in Quebec. 
It is not only in the vicinity, it is in uns', stressed it to be shown on clearly that it seeks to create a national founder dream. 
Quebec grew, emphasized much of its relationship with the north it: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technology of quebec, James bay. 
“To us, it is our future,” he added, after he had used a theatrical break in order to keep the enormous card. 
The north, 70% of the territory of quebec, includes a section of Labrador, Quebec always called in, said the prime minister in relation to the press. 
'This is a traditional attitude that all governments have followed. 
There is a marginal line where there is no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity to let this stance on behalf of the government again einnehmen', he said. 
In addition, “with climate change, we must reconsider our vision of the north,” said it and talked about the northwest passage, which will be viable because of the ice melt the whole year. 
Before the new geo - political background, the prime minister says that it is almost an obligation to prove it. 
And the residents of the area, the indigenous people and the Inuit? 
The prime minister said that the government of quebec would look very carefully with them, and that they would benefit from the project, especially the young. 
Two former Ministers of different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former members of pekistischer Ungava) has already begun discussions at around thirty communities. 
A ministerial committee in which Julie Boulet (transportation and mineral resources) will be an important place, led by Benoît Pelletier, took up the work. 
The prime minister does not rule out a major event, “not necessarily a summit”, but an opportunity, “we will create a common vision.” 
The development of the north will also go in line with the principles of sustainable development. 
the plan north is discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly” to be, “he said. 
Jean Charest described this “vision” as if it was a continuation of the liberal prime ministers who were before it in the office. 
'Like the liberals who were ahead in the office, we rethought, in order to transform the challenges in new growth and Entwicklungschanchen. 
This was one again and again to the issues raised by the weekend, along with a cocktail party to celebrate the 50. Anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage one opened. 
One of the resolutions approved plans to rename the power station in Beauharnois Adélard Godbout dam. 
“In which Godbout hydroelectric Quebec create have Lesage, which reached the quiet revolution and the nationalisation of water, electricity, for Bourassa, which made the James bay, knew our party to plan, the future,” said Jean Charest. 
Compared to the press it took the North” on another, this time conservative project shopping, on the Streets “tons of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963. 
Regarding the project hydropower dam Eastmain1a-Ruper, stresses mr. Charest who is planned for 2012 its operation. 
“Remains among us, but I intend to be”, he charged to his party members who caused applause storms with that. 
The prime minister, who did not say April that there would be no 2008, and certainly 2009 elections, has the possibility of holding this autumn a choice as possible for the, yet excluded. 
He stressed that the timetable is full, mainly because of a mission of community council in China and a summit between Quebec and New York. 
The general assembly of the weekend provided a platform of nationalist plans, particularly from “targets” was the condition of the liberal party leader who were readily accepted: The PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the “feature of quebec” in the constitution. 
It also wants the fact that Quebec will appoint members of the council of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications system and that these decisions regarding the gefällten in Quebec holds a veto. 
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the plan north with scepticism were included. 
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, got the policy for the development of the north you Quebec again, which introduced the government Landry 2001. 
According to their liberal government, when she came to power, 2003, had to use them. 
If she had done, “would be much earlier today we also” judged wife Marois alongside their candidate in Jean talon (where the election will take place) Françoise Mercure. 
The ADQ proposed to support the adoption of a plan north by the government. 
“But what we want is that this does not become, said” only a great idea the party leader Sébastien Proulx in agency for Mario Dumont, which today is returning from the holiday. 
The letter, a country entehrtes 
Mr Vic Toews, ex “law” Minister (what irony) in the cabinet Harper was the last summer took the opportunity to say about Louise Arbour it was a “disgrace” for Canada. 
His wife, we do not want to fight for justice and all our admiration to meet with ignominy states as much about the people around the prime minister, as Stephen Parker themselves. 
We are dealing with a government that did not get their in the concentration camp at Guantanamo bay as the only from all the countries concerned compatriot trapped home. 
A government that does not even consider the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when things have passed, accused him. 
The only government, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva convention, their word breaks and a child soldier in inhuman conditions vegetate leaves. 
The only thing that is down to a law parody in order to gauge the fault of the accused. 
Let us remember that above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the combination of the Canadian lawyers call for Omar Khadr home in order to get a fair trial in Canada. 
The government also closes its eyes to the torture: It concerns it little that a young adults will certainly be always mentally broken after so many years of the agony. 
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing a here just insidious capping of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy”, the word that is now Harper constantly like a flag ahead, and which sounds from his mouth so insignificant. 
So the time in which there is no moral more: You can use a Canadian citizen arbitrarily, torture and to shut down after the discretion of a head of government, supported until now only by the minority (he must include after 14 entirely to the minority…). 
Many voters believe to find their welfare at a party the virtue, law and order preach. But they do not see that this government itself renounced of what the reputation and the dignity of our country. 
The scandal, mr. Toews, does not say a lot, or anywhere else. 
Freedom of expression, the orwellsche speech Barrick gold 
In its spending from 17 September Le Devoir issued a letter from mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice-general manager of the Canadian gold mine Barrick gold. 
This confirms, and has a orwellsche logic that the largest gold production company in the world has a libel action on six million against three authors and small publishing house without money, with the aim of a “public transparent debate” to open. 
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, they do not see the truth, especially in the case of libel actions, but of the law. 
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely hidden by mr. Garver. 
As for Barrick gold is to be the best form a public debate on everyone to drive to ruin who dares, one of their opposing views. 
Whatever the process that the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada are large sums of money to spend to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers who are paid by the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine. 
Tactics with these unequal fighting is often to ruin the defenders in order to force an amicable settlement, which makes the opposite side silence and everyone deters who dares to return to the issue. 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present their views to the general public. 
In contrast, which is common, is that in many countries in which Barrick gold works in Canada debates normally through an exchange of ideas and not by club blows delivered. 
That would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed and had opened a genuine debate its books and documents from the newspapers, media publications and financing of independent inspection teams that could have brought light on this issue. 
But Barrick gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement. 
Perhaps could Mr Garver explain how he can at the same time to please the views of a “public” debate nevertheless and ignore the public? 
Apparently this word in the world of the vice-president only covers the generous paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very good muted aspect of the term. 
In a democracy, even slanderers have to talk about the right. 
What does not understand Barrick gold, or not to understand it, is that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada does this mainly because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine. 
The public is willing to listen to Barrick and judge, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework, many as toggle complaint term (in the process of “public debate” Barrick gold has a call on the authors of Canada Noir, in which she calls for them, it no longer to use…). 
Besides the surreal Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick gold is a direct attack on freedom for academic research and the truth, which is essential for any democratic society. 
She denied the right to quote and discuss facts and interpretations credible sources that form the basis of the intellectual work. 
If it is impossible, such as Canada in a country to investigate and discuss issues, the rich companies in the world does not like who can do otherwise then? 
If Barrick gold really wanted a public and open debate, it might bring these by following the scientific standards that were used by the authors of Noir Canada. 
It has to answer a right. 
The university environment, to which we have known for a long time, debates and inconsistencies under control and to get to solve conflicts. 
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick gold clearly shows that, contrary to what exists, has no desire to open debate. 
This is a loss for the academic world, as well as for the public debate, and it is time that governments take measures that restrict this kind of unwarranted complaints. 
Rescue operation to Wall Street, democrats and republicans can 
The Bush administration and senior congressional representatives, republican and democrat alike yesterday, came to an agreement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the great depression of the 1930s. 
The new version of the plan by 700 billion dollars, which is to stop the financial crisis, has for months Wall Street shaken, must still be approved by both chambers of congress. 
The main content are: Better control of the members of the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public money, new orders, in order to reduce the number because of arrears seized homes, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies. 
The American financial secretary Henry Paulson, yesterday, announced a few minutes, the president of the chamber of deputies Nancy Pelosi, and with the negotiations before representatives of the republicans, senator Judd Gregg after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon. 
“We have made great progress toward an agreement that will be market effective”, a representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson. 
“It was all about the real economy and the American people against the crisis on Wall Street to protect”, said the democrats. 
“This is the key point: If we do not do that, trauma becomes, the chaos and enormously its”, the republican Judd Gregg said the unrest in the daily life of the Americans. 
The negotiations had accelerated themselves during the last two hours, for fear of the impact that could have had a second failure on the trend of investors. 
The period, which had been agreed, was the market opening this morning. 
The two American presidential candidates who participated late in the negotiations, has been more as supporters of the agreement to express without missing, however, their dissatisfaction with the fact that we had to meet them in this extreme. 
The democratic senator bar rack's Obama insisted on the addition of certain contracts to the agreement to keep their houses above all those who is to allow the owners, and those that concern the salaries of the executives of the company saved by the state. 
'When the taxpayers do not ask to take due to the irresponsibility of certain people extraordinary measures is that anything that could be congratulate ourselves. 
But these measures are notwendig', declared it on American television stations. 
When he was asked to another broadcaster whether he will vote for the proposed plan, his republican opponent, John McCain replied: 'I want to know the details, but I hope it. 
'The guiding principles that I read [show] that this is something that we all have to digest, and we are going to move forward. 
The option for not doing nothing is not simply akzeptabel', he said. 
The 700 billion dollars plan is designed to it, with the taxpayers' money 
He is 14 months to a crisis, by the collapse of a real estate bubble released that led to the collapse risky mortgages (Subprime) before it extended to other forms of more spread loans (PCAA), and finally to freeze the financial power and to ruin the banks and banks are included. 
A group of republican members who let last week, the first attempt failed to agree. 
Since then, accepted the democrats that certain “toxic” active of societies in distress only by the government and to be bought are not, we think the impasse escaped. 
In order to round the positions off for all in congress, it also added an order, so it means that, if the government with this program should make losses within five years, it can raise new taxes, to get their assigned capital. 
The new plan provides for the payment of a total of 250 billion to 100 billion will come when the president considers it necessary. 
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved in a fresh vote by congress. 
In return for his help Washington gets lots of supported companies that make the case of profits dividends, and what it can sell again for him, if the storm ripped past. 
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to set the seizures procedures regarding the homes, which are linked to the property loans affected by this plan to stop and deadlines for the repayment and the compensation paid to the executives of the companies concerned. 
The developers of the plan would like them to be in the chamber of deputies already vote on it, and the senate on Wednesday. 
Despite all their efforts, it is still not sure that his plan green light. 
Other voices actually rose yesterday against this project, both on the part of the republicans and the democrats. 
“Whole clearly understands Washington us not”, said the republican Scott Garett, member of the finance committee of the chamber, his constituents. 
` Yes, we have a huge financial problem. 
Yes, there are solutions. 
But not those who is the taxpayers to pay too bitten'. 
The democratic delegate Brad Sherman, head of a group in congress, “the Kaukus of the doubters” means, represents the things differently, but to the same conclusion. 
“Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel Laureates, wrote to tell us too: We ask the congress not to be able to be pressurized too and carefully consider which way to go,” he said. 
At the same time we got the evidence in Europe that there is a global crisis. 
At an emergency meeting of the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the bank group Fortis for 11.2 billion (16.3 billion dollars). 
Intervention by the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would do without it, to buy their competitors that is in serious trouble, since her 2 billion (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis by the risky real estate loans in the United States. 
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the two major European banks and the ten largest insurers. 
“That is not lost money, said yesterday, the dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos. 
To offset we have a right to vote and an influence in the bank. 
This is exactly what the savers and households, uncertain times now announced there. “ 
During that time, the British government was about to nationalise another bank made by the financial crisis in trouble on the other side of the English Channel. 
According to the English press the government would take on all current credit with the bank Bradford and Bringley, over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate lending. 
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and the customer accounts of the British bank. 
Bradford and Bringley would be after Northern rock the second bank, which must nationalized the British government since the beginning of the financial crisis. 
Paul Newman (19252008) - death of a dedicated icon 
The beauty of the azure eyes has long been a trump card, nobody would say, its weakness. 
Had the American actor with the charming smile rid itself from the narcissistic mirror? 
Yes or no. 
Its subtlety, his sensitivity and an obvious talent kept it probably also away from a powerful position that brings the truly awful monsters to the world. 
But what a great continued runner. 
On Friday at the age of 83 from the effects of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut's the deceased Paul Newman remains one of the last icons of the American cinema that golden years. 
It was less than monumentally Brando, which he had enough, and that is what this time a kind of a rival on the screen was more cautious in its game, it is probably more fragile, but exactly the same an apostle of freedom and explosive up dramaturgical conventions. 
Miscellaneous blood items are often wonderful children. 
He was born in Ohio 1925 as the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother. 
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream should develop. 
Without excessive ego, extreme quality criterion. 
Because it is a whole country was reflected again, which was in love with Self made it into the fighter who was injured in the Pacific war in combat, that in the early 1950s game art in Yale studied and then the Actor's studio in New York visited before he had success at the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema. 
The man who fought for the civil rights, was also the driver, who was 1979 when the 24-Stunden-Rennen von Mans second, and a sex symbol, although he lived together with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958 in a presentation relationship. 
It also disappear unknown aspects of this mysterious reserved, committed and star hypersensitive to the glamour of show Business, whose mystery you will never fully resolved. 
A decent man in the purest sense of the word. 
Death Paul Newmans postponed the cinema lovers this weekend in tumbles, while in the dark screen memories of all the major roles were played. 
More than half a century of American film art in constant change that goes with it. 
Then again, the charming cowboy from “urges Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” (1969), and the young man who rejected his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) into the cat on the hot sheet metal roof, 1958 were filmed by Tennessee Williams. 
A much more in the past has evoked memories (1990), which met the not all of its sensitive mr. Bridge, who is upset at his old age by a wedding, their promises. 
So many other Paul Newmans gave him in the course of history. 
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Someone UP There may be ME (a handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was meant to James Dean, after their death again took up and who admit Newman 1956 correctly. 
This pleasant hoodlum in leading The Sting (Clou), who was excellent 1973 with Oskar for the best film. 
As a bitter and vengeful billiards players in the wonderful The Hustler Robert Rossen (1961), 
The head of the times, that he was. 
Yet it. 
In his personal record eras. 
The youth knows it mainly from the cult film Slap SHOT by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox coach of an ice hockey team. 
His supporters have recovered 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers. 
In the last part of 2003 as the godfather of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes circles closed. 
Unlike many cinema myths, which withdrew early enough from the film world should remain Newman for a long time in the saddle and Hollywood, its assets, its splendor and betray his concessions. 
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, not without humour when living challenge to the “Underplaying” when he felt his overly expression-strong achievements. 
The bar was not always easy for fine Paul Newman, who roles long zuflogen only in this way. 
But he played a rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: Neurotiker, alcohol, or Fieslinge desperate to perfect description he reflected his slipping and his rebel. 
As a producer revealed Newman unknown aspects of its true sensitive sensitivity. 
His Rachel, a woman fine-intimate portrait of full melancholy drew Rachel of 1968 (after the saga of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the leading role. 
He who lost his son Scott by an overdose, given that 1984 his film Harry and Son, a working full subtlety and sadness. 
With the flood of credit that yesterday spilled over Newman, his close friend and former comrade in arms, said Robert Redford (they had together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid easily) very moved: “Its current improved my life and this country.” 
Generosity and enjoyment of life were essential features of the late actor. 
Apart from its legendary career now also a great supporter of civil rights, environmental protection and the independent cinema, opposed the drift of Hollywoods goes through. 
We probably often felt it with the foot in full bowls pastry or other food goods to see, and this rather distasteful to Vinaigrette, sauces, although we found it even fun at first. 
The profits from its turnover resulted in his foundation for children in need. 
Instead of resting on his myth, committed Newman until the shot. 
He left a letter with these words on his five daughters: 'Always and in the end your father was incredibly grateful for his star. 
It was a privilege to be here. “ 
And for us it was a privilege to be able to follow the lives of such an intelligent and generous American actor. 
An exemplary citizen in the closest and broadly. 
Which produced in the bill factory of also &amp; CO.? 
At 8 negotiations start criminal proceedings against János well and his associates. 
The defendants in particular being involved in organized crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud and other criminal acts, including document forgery, have been charged. 
According to prosecutor funds for their own purposes, lukrierten from the tender, were used, while the services rendered were often filled with fake bills. 
National funds and subsidies for autonomy, a total of 65 million HOOF, are to be partially flowed into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part, to the private health insurance for individuals. 
As the investigating authorities announced, with references advertizing revenue fictitious invoices, and the clubs are not to have followed their obligations. 
According to the indictment, a majority of the bill is to have been rigged. 
The bill blocks were bought, let the round seals at the market by Józsefváros make one in Kiskunhalas. 
The decision on which companies bills are to be issued, has decided to send István Lados north of János also on that tour of the Lake Balaton. 
In the course of this “study tour” Lados should make pensions and restaurants. 
He called on the pits Konsumationen in order to be able to enact based on these documents bills for youth and sports Ministry, the Ministry of labor and social, as well as the autonomy of Budapest. 
These bills are said to have been manipulated by the majority by István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, the latter is to be responsible for our information on the condition of the reports. 
One of the goals of Lados' “study tour” was a beer restaurant. 
As two of CO and is to be taken in the year 2003 issued bills, catering company is to have the regaled ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület. 
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group not at once the restaurant would have set in. 
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 on the foundation labour Jövőért, later known as A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, were also serious form and substance mistakes. 
In a pension in Badacsonytomaj which can accommodate than ten people at the same time, only had three rooms and no more, 130 guests are to be under consideration. 
Apparently, just as no limits were drawn to the imagination of the bill counterfeiters, as it is the Pigal Kft. gone, a catering company, whose accounting records of clients jobs and Jövőért Hoppá do not even appear according to prosecutor. 
The secretary-general told Győző hvg.hu Farkas was immediately clear that it was forged documents, when the public prosecutor's office in a survey documents were presented to him. 
“Our company name and the tax numbers have been due to the brand.” 
And further: Apart from formal errors also was wrong that the company was to have held a hundred people, after they have generally eleven rooms, which may offer no place to so many people. 
Also on the bill food supply was quoted in the restaurant is for a long time in business. 
The busy bill counterfeiters also failed to verify that targeted the Budapester taken by offering travel agency exclusively trips abroad, and so it to Hungary trips to the cash payment bill, which also contradicted the accounting practices. 
What is known in the course of the investigation, to have it in addition to the pits the VAT afore-mentioned, although travel services, referring to a country outside the European Union, are mehrwertsteuerfrei. 
The size of the VAT was generally on four of the hotel Révfülöp Kft. the foundation labour Jövőért issued bills, so the company instead of 25, only 15 percent of VAT. charges, but also by the staff exclusively machine bills are issued, the forged documents were handwritten. 
Another mistake that has made the “Rechnungslegern” was that they had indicated the public prosecutor's office in a case “transport of goods” as setup performance, although the company specialized in investment advice is not offered said. 
It was due to further formal errors, false invoice format, false stamp - that at a Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as at XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont issued bills as counterfeiting to be exposed to. 
Also, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehértó whose secretary-general protested the bills have never been issued. 
A “mistake” is the counterfeiters with HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza occur: It was time (2001) in breaking up when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was to have eaten there, so the trustee in bankrupty indicated the bills have issued. 
Deliberately falsified 
The other group that are bill casual people, he was aware of who they would have to disclose fictitious invoices. 
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták issued the foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány bills for the foundation, A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért, at a cost of around 4 million HOOF. 
According to the indictment the Collab Kft. one of the accused, to the issuance of the fictitious invoices persuades Ludovic Györfi. 
It also bio- gate Kft in liquidation. is also well and CO. worked: In the year 2003 is the GmbH foundation labour Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the clubs and Egyesület Atlasz Vörösfenyő Egyesület in counterfeit bills in the total value of HOOF 5 million have supplied, not setup achievements. 
There was also no exchange, since the bills were removed immediately after the exhibition, which people in their documents forgot to comment. 
The third group that bill-casually includes people who are directly with the defendants. 
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian of the delta Trió Kft., a resident in Budapest, but not discoverable fuel and vehicle commercial firm. 
The company is to have issued several bills in the period of October until December 2005 on the sale of computer components in the total value of HOOF about 18 million. 
According to investigative powers since 14 September 2005 in liquidation cash current investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas as buyers of these bills worked. 
Of the company was a Romanian, for which the company documents should also be set by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005. 
According to our information Kubatov confessed bills on behalf of the GmbH during the investigation. the clubs and Atlasz Hoppá, as well as A Együtt Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány have issued and their value. 
The companies company-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the investment Jos Bt. are said to have been created by Romanian bricklayers on Iván Kubatovs express wish. 
In truth, none of these companies were active, which was under accusing because of a lack of contracts. 
However, it could benefit from the companies: To call it, such as his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was awarded the preparation of the formation of a company documents, on behalf of the companies bills to the clubs associated with this in connection with Atlasz and Y-Generáció. 
Overall, Kubatov is to have issued 15 bills in the total value of HOOF 14.2 million in the name of the companies' investment funds, delta Trió, company-Bani Jos, investment and Jos Linaxtrade to the organizations. 
The public prosecutor's office expects Kubatov could have taken 10% of the bill sum, as well as the VAT in each case. 
Kubatov is even the company Szi Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices abused, in this case the bills were attached to the applications by Biztos Pont. 
The company and Y-Generáció Szövetség A decaying Magyarországért delivered its applications in 2006 at the non-profit organization of the socialist party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (“TMA”). 
Both received 500,000 Forints each, but these amounts misused. 
In order to conceal this, they have the TMA five fictitious invoices of Works team Kft. . 
These bills were in fact guaranteed in search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Board of Education. 
With the negotiations by some defendants on a commitment by the approach of the bill forging - ahead of the public prosecutor's office has already made, are expected. 
A sensation could be when the principal defendant János also decided to a comprehensive confession. 
His last information was less detailed and, although it had repeatedly promised to report on fully all his confession is pending. 
The question remains whether it is in their interest, whether the socialists signed a pact with him on the compensation of the majority of the damage caused by HOOF 50 million, and whether it is in return, ready to take responsibility. 
However, it is quite possible that now “insulted” games, after their applications were met with moderating the arrest and the house arrest on deaf ears. 
While other criminals who caused and did not recompense these much greater damage with economic crimes, at large, or at least under house arrest, is also denied that option. 
The psychology of over-bidding, or why we are willing to pay more 
With auctions buyers tend to spend more and to exaggerate the offered for sale. 
Neurologists and economic researchers from the university of New York has now neurological-economic discovering the bases of the well-known and apparently irrational behaviour. 
According to one in the “Science” study want people in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, published magazine not beaten to give ourselves and are not prepared to pay even inflated prices. 
The researchers tried to explore the neurological scheme of this “game” with experimental auctions. 
A group of volunteers should play Lotto, while others took part in a playful activity, in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI). 
With both plays the players money could win, but increased activity Striatum, a complex was measured below the brain crust, with losers of the auction, which the opponent over-bidding plays a major role. 
Apart from many other functions that brain region is responsible for the “self reward” of the nervous system. 
The researchers said, the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of Striatums. 
In order to support their argument, economists in the research group employed additional studies of Nachverfolgung of money. 
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions. 
The value of the product was told the monitoring group, then to have its operations. 
Another group 15 dollar reward was promised beyond that, if they emerge as winners from the game. 
The third party received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game. 
The difference between the two groups consisted only of the fact that the emphasis on the one on winning, while the other one was losing. 
As proof of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists but the members of the group playing against losing” were for higher deployments willing than those in the control or “profit” group. 
“These results can be derived from a previous economic theory. 
They have watched the attitudes of auctions so far only with joy at winning, or risk prevention. 
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved, thanks to the picture-giving neurological procedures, so that we now have a third statement prepared” Andrew crushed stone, professor of economics faculty of the university of New York. 
Hepatitis: When is a doctor to be visited? 
Worldwide, some people with chronic hepatitis B and C suffer half a billion, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease among the leading cause of death is listed. 
The number of infected people will be treated in this country on a hundred thousand estimated, but only seven thousand, which is due to the fact that the patients often do not know they are infected. 
Hepatitis is the full term for through various viruses released, liver infectious diseases. 
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are frequent, but the cause and the disease differ from each other. 
According to the agent hepatitis viruses in two different kinds proliferate: with hepatitis A and E by the digestive tract (for example through contaminated food or water), with hepatitis B, C, D can be transferred the virus by blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, sheath secretion or saliva). 
A vaccine is recommended against the virus C at least gives passengers against viruses A and B it no vaccine. 
The symptoms of hepatitis A point about two to three weeks to consumption of contaminated food and win from uneasy constitution, weakness, bellyache and nausea. 
Then the jaundice on the skin and in the eyes, the chair is brightly, the urine dark, and the recovery can take up to two, three weeks. 
Worldwide, approximately 1 million people, the far more serious diseases of hepatitis B die such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver. 
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected in drug treatment. 
Including hepatitis C can have serious consequences: untreatedly it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. 
Most infected people do not even know about their disease because the virus destroys the liver cells insidiously, in many cases, the first symptoms point to 20-30 years. 
That is why timely contraception, such as regular monitoring investigations, is essential. 
There are three groups, where it is more often: those who underwent 1991 of a blood transfusion, drug addicts and tattooed. 
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C sufferers worldwide to 200 million. 
Since the disease has proven during a routine laboratory tests already, it is wise to visit with the first signs of unknown origin, the family doctor. 
In time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, with the risk of infection is avoided and prevented the formation of cancer. 
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, 2004 for the first time by patient agencies worldwide. 
The aim of the action is aware of these viruses caused by chronic liver inflammation to strengthen its creation and the importance of the screening. 
Have believer in less pain? 
The latest research results show that the religious faith works like a kind of “pain killer”, which is already have facilitated the death of catholic martyrs. 
Scientists from the Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment: It investigated whether the belief in God will feel the pain of man, announced the British tide “telegraph.” 
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation received 12 every believer and atheist electric shocks, while they studied a picture of the mother of God. 
The results showed the believers could get the most out of the pain. 
By means of a brain Scan technology could even be proven that catholics could activate the part of their brain, which is responsible for the painful adjustment. 
The investigation was first in a research project in which alongside scientists also thinkers and theologians of different sections of the university. 
In seeking the subjects sparkling equipment was put together by the left hand, which gave the electric shocks. 
The participants were asked to focus attention on two paintings: On the one hand, a picture of the mother of God, stripped of Sassoferrato during 17. Century and Leonardo da Vinci's “lady with Hermelin.” 
The researchers hoped that the sight of the virgin Maria under the believers would cause a kind of religious trance, while they elected Vincis picture because it hardly differed and was felt reassured than down from the other painting. 
The trial subjects spent a half-hour each in a MRI scanner and received at this time, a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they either religious or the other paintings should respect. 
Catholics reported them at the sight of the mother of God “in security” would have felt as if they were “umsorgt”, and they would have felt “peace and quiet.” 
During the religious painting they reported about 12% fewer pain, as if they had Leonardos work. 
The psychologist Miguel far iass, who also participated in the attempt, said that it could cause similar impact on other, pictures, working closely with the atheists, you would have the appropriate photo only to find. 
“We would have to find an image that is very positive feelings, such as a mother and a father, so the psychologist. 
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research. 
“Practicing the faith should change our personality, and do it in many cases” Wright. 
After these excellent results remains the only issue that effect would have a Madonna picture Leonardos or other similar painter at the painful adjustment of believers. 
Would the high-quality virgin Maria reach even better results? 
You are, what you say about you 
At the time of its tenth anniversary can join with Google and right to maintain: it is to be found in the pockets of people exactly as over their heads in the sky. They know where people spent their holiday, to go to experts, and that they are moving. 
And that is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one the Google. 
Towards doubters that are plagued by Orwell horror visions, it can do: This is the essence of the Web 2,0 overlooked. 
In an interview with the Financial Times Schmidt said recently that the main purpose of Google was to collect more personal information on users and so the original purpose of the company's move closer, according to which they make “all the details of this world.” 
Schmidt said, Google is after ten years of world-changing work still only at the beginning of the data collection. 
Asked about the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said: he desired, Google would be able to issues like “what I had to do tomorrow?” or “job really suits me?” in response, but software programs are not yet ready as well as they do not know enough about the users. 
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches search words were registered, as well as the IP-addresses, which was found, and that visited sides. 
For example, two years ago, the introduced “Personalized search” permits to store the visitors' its own search process and then go back to so that takes can be generated later many more accurately, and on the same logic, also known as the “Recommendations” is based on the system recommends tailor-made products and services because of the former preferences. 
Wonders users but, as in the case of a data abuse happened,“if you look at what I do” show some worried whether the Google data monopoly. 
It is in most cases, but rather the potential power that work fear exciting, represented by the company, and less guilt feeling or fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or uprising against power that encounter with many Internet Usern rejection. 
But it is a proven fact that the search words are not only stored, but are passed on to starter in the third case, and in these cases of law, there is no protection for the personal rights Internet users. 
A prime example of this was recently the case against paedophilia in Brazil, during his Google of the Brazilian government information, which was compiled by the Gemeinschaftssite called “and” Orkut also made an identification of pedophilias. 
By personal rights procured user could still in Can breathe a sigh of relief when Google has successfully brought together with civil rights organization EFF against the FBI in court: therefore, Google may be forced to continue with no point of the constitution to publish information the FBI in secret. 
(Though the Federal Government successfully reached the publication of 50.000 Web addresses and 1,000 search words with reference to years ago passed the protection of children and adolescents law, but you have become the list the individual users, or their Web search and word list on two months withheld retroactively.) 
Google image of therefore remains controversial: Those who publish their personal data reluctantly, because they fear the loss of their private and privacy by using the Google services, castigate the company with the conservative launching companies rightful indignation. 
Meanwhile, the American “Geek culture”, which is present in many countries and inspired computer fans, activists and user unites, sees the next generation of the “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is due to Windows market leader, even if they are fighting for the same purpose. 
A possible reason for this is the fact that Google does not call for his Usern unlike Microsoft identification codes and makes its services free of charge, so openly, constantly updated source code and software package appear to be far more attractive, more youthful and cooler, as the official practices of the software giant. 
On the other hand, the Geeks look through the problematic relationship of individual rights and the Internet razor-sharp - a relationship that moved in particular in recent years, thanks to the term “Web 2,0”. 
With the “Web 2,0” is it to trace nothing else when around collaboration, talk, the user left deliberately and uses the available channels of communication, and even if the proportions are individually different, the main issue remains the same to show that publicly. 
An average young person can at the same time manage on several community portals his profile, on Facebook Xanga, can this through other services, such as Twitter, or music services as last.fm to link, and can all in a Nachverfolgungssystem such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm eventually merge. They also can lead blogs, which automatically constitute the latest photo galleries are at geoconstant Flickr or Picasa. 
And a number of other exemplary cases shows: With the party photographs of the friend finds out soon, with whom she unfaithful boyfriend distracted himself, or who will lay off workers, because it allows air to his anger in his blog very honest about the management, one thing is certain: The term “confidentiality” has now been entirely new interpreted. 
Who is leading an online life, is what he surrenders from, so roughly one could put the philosophy behind the conduct of today's youth. 
And who is trying to keep a secret or the Google monopoly, can do so, such as with Scroogle intentionally, but no traces of tools, which hits the search engine of Google, leaves. 
Many people do not register deliberately at community sides, so they are not discoverable, however, online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic RSS tools and fed can deal with alternative versions, which are linked to a huge server parks and do not generate therefore the best performance of the user. 
Public opinion is now to avoid until Google shows its true face. 
With its current value of USD 156 billion company is appropriate for Intel (USD 124 billion) even before IBM (USD 140 billion), or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), advertizing space of AdWords/AdSense threaten the income of the advertizing agencies, and the faster introduced services are not only for Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches. 
Critical viewers find but also the disturbing antipols: For example, management of the group rejected a protest by the staff, after the charges of company-owned kindergarten have doubled, said the management, the repeated food supply of the staff is too expensive. All this seems almost mild against Google and has agreed to an agreement in the year 2006 before the Chinese government to its knees, according to which all regime-critical takes, or those who violate the good taste, were filtered. 
The internal regulation of the company is that in advance, no new service is found, but only if it is already available. However, the events in the coming months and years could turn back some strong: While some think of Google magazine paper and CAN or archiving project now accept proportions that the company would have to deal quickly with the supreme Court, are more because of the system “Health” affected others who makes the production of a complete health profile on the basis of findings, doctors and problems. 
And the fact that Google is developing a genetic database, provides for the next generation of Sci Fi authors have real - about “Scroogled” which describes famous novel of Cory Doctorow at best orwellschen manners a future in which people are frightening closable thanks to data obtained from Google. 
Two young people to help the double murderer of Ózd during the trail removal 
In connection with the double murder of Ózd police interrogated now two young people who had suspected of eliminating the tracks have helped the spokesman Polizeikommissariats Borsod on Tuesday. 
The young people were confessing, currently the assistance they are charged. 
According to the news agency MTI there are two girls who defend themselves at large. 
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years. 
The idea of double murder of Ózd, an old 23-year local man, was taken on Sunday in custody. 
The man is under strong suspicion of money greed intentionally several people have been murdered. 
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that 23-year old one the 53-year old more money had owed. 
The suspect refused to pay its debts, however, so it attracted its creditor on Wednesday in an area in Ózd where he killed him and his daughter of nine years. 
According to the MTI the man who planned the act carefully, this is also having the murders with one at the scene hidden weapons. 
Together with experts now police investigating the murder weapon, as well as the circumstances of their use. 
Bid to Prague stock exchange puts the Warsaw stock exchange 
The Warsaw stock exchange for a hundred percent purchase of blocks of shares in the Prague stock exchange offered some 200 million, or 5 billion Czech crowns. 
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw stock exchange, reiterated the offer, despite the fact that had put Poland that they were expelled earlier from the Czechs over possible owners of their stock exchange. 
This is because the Warsaw stock exchange completely belongs to the state. 
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish government, which wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months. 
After news of the Czech newspaper “E15” contain the offer that Poland the highest purchase price, which was offered for the Prague stock exchange. 
The newspaper says, the vienna stock exchange, the NASDAQ Transatlantic, put up to now, the New York stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the German stock exchange of offers. 
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague stock exchange said last week that of all the interested parties the Warsaw stock exchange would be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that in the future, even to close the Prague stock exchange could lead. 
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague stock exchange on 5-10 billion crowns. 
According to the agreement of the shareholders, 90% of the shares could be sold. 
Largest holder of the Prague stock exchange is followed by the 25 Patria Business investment bank in agreement with the participation of the Ceská Sporitelna bank with 14,7 and the tiger holding Four S.a.r.l with 13,5 percent. 
The financial crisis in the eyes of European newspapers 
In its international financial crisis has always commenting further exacerbating some leading European sheets spoke of “second 11 September” on Tuesday. 
The global financial disaster we owe to the American president, said about “La Repubblica”, which is not even a president has been able to his own party for the bill behind him to one that was to bring some relief to the frightening situation… 
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor” how the billions of investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, “second 11 September.” 
Parts of the press in Madrid locate the scapegoat in Washington. 
In view of the “El Mundo” the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now on the verge of collapse. 
The American financial system is threatening to break down more and more, including the whole world will suffer. 
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now faces after the vote in congress the danger that Washington does not have a political means to crisis management. 
The world economy hanging in the air, at a time when one of the biggest changes in the history of capitalism. 
You can not ignore the threat, says about the Geneva “daily indicator.” 
Some states could put rescue packages to their banks in guessed staggering and save the banks with taxpayers' money from bankruptcy. 
But if a domino effect is released and it to go more banks broke, neither further cash infusions, or other immediate help. 
In the long - term, the EU member states would have to take their shadow and to centralize control of the money markets. 
But on Monday, more than 100 billion euros were paid off, reminding on banks slacking off the vienna “standard”. However, according to the newspaper, the concerns are becoming more realistic that for the Americans, now the European taxpayers would have to do something more deeply into their pockets, in order to get out of the crisis. 
So far, the European Union did not deal with the crisis, which now like a tsunami on the old continent sweeps. 
The “saviours” would have “no” wag immediately several hundred billion, but it would be wise to keep in which case it would be wise, the taxpayers' money to touch to prevent an even greater damage. 
Smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee 
What is the best way for the development of new technologies to accident prevention, not to imitate if the barrier sensors from nature? 
For example, those of bees. 
With the CEATEC in Japan, an astonishing project was presented with Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in creating new accident of avoiding systems. 
In cooperation with the Tokyo university built steered organic MIME tables system of the type of Nissan BR23C autorobots that from a mini cars, equipped with the characteristics of bees, to support a goal, the development of a system that avoids any clashes. 
In the air each bee forms its own, oval “private sector, which is very similar to our own “shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR research and development, with the exhibition. 
The compound of the bee which can see in every direction and in a corner of over 300 degrees, plays an important role. 
In order to copy the workings of the compound, the researchers took up the idea of laser-steered distance area finder. 
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a visual field of 180 degrees within 2 meters, computes its routes and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which opens the collision-avoiding process immediately. 
The barrier is registered in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changed the course, similar to the movement of bees, by turning the tyre on the spot. 
Unlike past systems this ploy purely instinctive will take place. 
“If it would be, the autorobot could not respond quickly enough, around the obstacles to escape,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the “Mobility Laboratory” and the autorobot project. 
The system must respond to instinctive immediately and, since this technology is the home and most vulnerable part of the shield, for a class at present, within the accidents even as inevitable. 
The entire process must reflect the conduct of bees, if they avoid other bees. 
And that must be conducted in a fraction of a second. 
But can be avoided, unlike the bees, not up and down, or diagonally takes place, it can only be two-dimensional, only to turningability of tyre. 
While many opportunities for bees infinitely here openly in order to avoid another bees, the researchers could use of the rotating motion, or and accelerate the deceleration autorobot only. 
The BR23C polymer contains lithium batteries, which are easier and more energy efficient, and therefore a longer life span, than conventional lithium-ion batteries. 
Andoh said it arrives at the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store. 
This equipment must process some inputs per second only and respond to it. 
It does not have to store them, or to produce based on previous exercises an intuitive, logical response, so it is constantly only a handful of KB MEMORY. 
It requires no gigabits and megabyte-heavy MEMORies. 
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology that will be standard according to Nissan within the next ten years in production. 
Another application could find the technology with the GPS satellite navigation by driving and driving it in such a way to target the driver deliberately around obstacles. 
A name for the sündteure child 
Now the written version of the 700-Mrd-Dollar of heavy rescue package law, which will have to be used in several stages and the purchase of bad loans from the banks. 
In the first round, half the money should be spent. 
In a meeting which went on Saturday until midnight local time east coast, in the end, the congressional representatives struggled through themselves, announced after debates for several days to reach an agreement on the 700-Milliarden-Dollar heavy rescue package Reuters. 
“We have made,” said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president in the U.S. congress, and substantial progress, we need to get the agreement only on paper. 
Both presidential candidates supported the compromise on the rescue package, Barack Obama and John McCain. 
Finance Minister Henry Paulson meant to the result: The program will show it effective and efficient, but we need to do more. According to Pelosi it would affect rum-tear at the helm of the economy, not the rescue of Wall Street, however. 
The written version of the package was published, was released but no high-altitude flight on the stock exchanges time before the opening of the Asian markets, so that Washington Sunday evening 8 (Central - European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning). 
On Monday, the first of the Lower House to vote on the bill for the strengthening of the economy of 2008, the senate in the series. 
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday evening with Pelosi, and also the white house welcomed the news of the agreement. 
We are satisfied with the night at the progress and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our economy and protect our markets, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the white house. 
The program is different from the original recommendation by the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once on the purchase lazier, with loans from burdened securities. 
In a first Tranche not more than half of the 700-Milliarden-Betrages is to be spent, with 250 immediately available billion, according to the congress will vote as expected on Monday at the Causa. This amount is to be spent on the purchase of credit-burdening, bad securities, and that the president is to decide on further USD 100 billion. 
The program is being investigated by an independent commission, including the president of the Federal Reserve. 
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the congress. 
In the spirit of the law, the Treasury can use a combined tactic: It is at the same time, bad loans, mortgages and charged with mortgages bonds to purchase, or other “toxic” loans. 
The leaders of the Ministry reported that the purchase can take place in an auction, and directly. 
The law allows the companies can look to participate in an insurance scheme in which the Treasury guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies that pay for damage expecting similar charges. 
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary means that 700 billion dollars as emergency aid to the American financial system can be made available, it is important for the purchase of banned substances, their insurance, or prevent a systemic risk, which is caused by the collapse of a larger bank. 
We take the necessary steps to ensure that we are ready for the introduction of the law as soon as it was signed, so Paulson. 
The executives and now banks' ordered guessed in trouble at state aid can count on the fact that his handling mentioned in the overseas Slang in passing “golden handshake” are cut by the government. 
A cut in salaries will exist only in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury helps out in each case. 
Cuts is taxed essentially means that if the Ministry purchases in the context of an auction, so “golden handshake” unless the retired bank head into the pension is deported. 
In the case of a direct purchase of bad loans the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that the manager salaries are not excessive. 
The picture also means that the existing golden handshake contracts are not changed, the restrictions only refer to new agreements, so that all the more people to participate in the program. 
This is the first case in American history that cuts are governed by manager salaries by law, comment on the democrats Barney frank, chairman of the finance committee, the measure. 
The state wins equities at the participating banks, so the risk to the taxpayers sinks, since they can also take part as soon as the economy and the savings bank is better. 
The bill provides that the president must present in the next five years, a proposal to congress, as the taxpayers are again to recover their lost money from the financial sector. 
However, there have been on both sides sceptics who expressed their concerns about the plan. 
That is what the American people expect us to the plan is protecting the taxpayers' money under any circumstances, so the California republican Darrell Issa. 
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur said: The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visas to the united states from 2009? 
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the fact that the American-Hungarian visa agreement on the 12. Jänner will come into force, as the Foreign Minister before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago said. 
They believe that “now everything depends on whether electronic immigration or control system is overseas in time.” 
He stressed, however, that there will not be an entry permit in the new system, but would have the tourists in advance to register. 
The chief of the Hungarian diplomacy leads from now on negotiations in Washington. 
It meets with secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, who will present the “middle Distinguished Service Cross with star” to the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the advisers in foreign policy of the democrat Barack Obama and the republican presidential candidate John McCain. 
Barack Obama and McCain support rescue package for banks 
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the great American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the 700 billion dollars heavy rescue package for banks. But there are also politicians who demand the resignation of Finance Minister. 
The congress and representatives of the government announced after several-day-long marathon discussions on Sunday tomorrow that they came to an agreement on the bank rescue package. 
The crisis of Wall Street, as well as the thawing frozen out credit market has become the central questions of the presidential campaign. 
Obama and McCain, both claim to be better than the respective opponent likely to lead the country from the economic crisis. 
According to recent surveys Obama could expand its lead further, thanks to the economic issues, while Mccain's high, which gave the presentation of vice-presidency candidate Sarah Palin to him after the republican convention, there-melted at the same time. 
During an election campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday Obama expressed his hope that congress will soon adopt the law on the 700 billion dollars heavy package. 
He stressed that the plan included those passages of consumer protection that it supported by. 
“We must now act responsibly he said (...), your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened” before 35.000 spectators. 
It did not fail to designate Mccain's economic vision “obsolete.” 
In the station ABC paid interview said McCain: “We all too difficult to have kiefern… but doing nothing is certainly no alternative.” 
The republican senator said the plan also provides for the establishment of a control commission for the Finance Minister, as well as restrictions on the allocation of Top managers, something that he had existed. 
Obama, McCain told the CBS no definitive role would have played in the negotiations, while it, Obama, with the Minister was in contact. 
On Sunday, the spokesman for the house of representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that the Lower House will probably have to vote on Monday on the bill. 
Press review of the German-speaking countries 
The right side is intact, only the voters have become more assertive within the camp, “Der Spiegel” commentates the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria. 
In Austria are Haider and Co prepared to govern, in order to prevent a red-black coalition. 
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de) 
In the online edition left populated German news magazine Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his rule of “Bavaria revolution exterminates their fathers.” 
In view of the prestigious political scientist the erosion of the christian social union began long before the sad Beckstein Huber duo his offices took over. 
The Christian-social renewed Bavaria for decades, now the modern people turn away from them. 
The era break is also a problem of the Christian democrats, as well as for Angela Merkel. 
Quite a surprise the disaster of the christian social union did not come, but rather on Sunday in the end what gone, but rather than previously exactly ten years appeared: the unquestionable hegemony of a state party 
As for ten years, 1998, land the CSU with 47,7 percent and crashed here for the first time since the 1950s under the fifty-percent mark 
Repeated itself Stoiber era quoted three years ago with the elections 2005, that is still in the deal. 
The modernization consistently pursued by the CSU in the state wiped out their mothers and fathers at last. 
Sociologists had predicted, but the pace had much verschätzt themselves 40 years ago. But knew without effect secularization, educational success, which does not remain prosperous inlet by east and North German in those regions of Bavaria on the loyalty of the CSU voters. 
Modernisation always comes with option. And it has political consequences. 
The right side is intact, only the voters in the camp became more critical and more self-willed. 
It should be noted that in recent weeks almost classical citizen groups expressed the greatest distance from the christian social union: the professions, the commercial middle class and voters with Abitur such as graduates. 
Here the support of the CSU dropped to below 40 percent. 
The press (diepresse.com) 
The conservative vienna newspaper reports in their “with whom? Party chiefs cool in coalition issues” called articles on the chaotic internal situation in Austria after the new elections. 
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal affairs. 
The BZÖ points in all directions open to discussion, while the Greens do not want to commit themselves to a coalition. 
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on the public television, the party chiefs would hardly look into their cards. 
SPÖ boss Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to try to negotiate with the ÖVP. 
The SPÖ wants to show that the cooperation of both parties is perfectly possible for real in some states and in the social partnership that is already the case. 
Whether he left himself open a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, which currently ÖVP boss as vice-chancellors, could present Faymann. 
He said the voters would have voted the dish Molterer course. 
A repeat of this would not be eligible. 
Meanwhile, Molterer responded to red offers carefully. 
Cooperation can not be fruitful, it meant when Faymann attempts to interfere in internal requests from the ÖVP. 
If his party is in opposition, or in the coalition, is currently very open, and these issues should be discussed ÖVP internally. 
BZÖ head of Jörg Haider pointed out in all directions. 
“On red to prevent, we are ready to take over government responsibility” so Haider. 
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken 
I have today in the Paris European summit to equal opportunity, which will begin this year of the host country, France. 
In his speech to the house Lívia Járóka, Fidesz member of the European people's party, drew the attention of particularly education segregation since this is one of the most serious violations of what happens to Roma children, but this was the biggest obstacle to their eligibility requirements. 
The high-level meeting was opened by the French employment and Social Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, European commissioner for employment, social affairs and equal opportunity. 
Among the players representatives from governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and ngos in the field of equal opportunities. 
As the press office of the EP of Fidesz announces, Járóka drew attention to the fact that apart from discrimination in the workplace search, Roma were pushed out primarily because of their low level of education in the job market. 
“The vast majority of the Roma young people do not have middle school education, and thanks to bad basic education only a small part of it can achieve a university degree.” 
Further emphasized that Járóka education is a fundamental human right, that a key role would come during the enforcement of other human rights. 
Investment in the early training of Roma children the economy of the EU member states can strengthen. 
In view of the members, it is important that these ties as wide a circle as possible, Roma and non-roma - realize. 
Because the sooner the Roma pupil school begins, the more increases their chances to become productive member of the job market. and by income and VAT they contribute to the government spending. 
“As european citizens, the Roma, the right to high-quality education must be secured, bad and segregierte instruction must be stopped” so Lívia Járóka. 
As he said, a common goal and action-oriented action by the European union, is necessary in order to speed up the Desegregationsprozess in the education sector. In addition, the true compliance is essential existing and planned anti-discrimination directive. 
“We need the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment to break and Roma children democratic opportunities exist on the future of Europe as full citizens to contribute, called for” Járóka. 
Since the congress organized in Berlin last year the annual summit with the goal, a unique forum for making progress with the goals of equal opportunities and discrimination freedom at European and national level by bringing in the sense of the “European year of equal opportunities.” 
CSU: Mercy on time 
At the end of October on the fate of the fallen Beckstein Huber Duos deciding 
Despite the election debacle now no heads roll, at which point of the Bavarian CSU personnel debates was postponed. 
Party chief Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long the grace period. 
On the fate of the tandem after the disastrous 17-percent ballot loss at the October last weekend with the extraordinary Party Congress is decided. 
The duo much therefore we already see through that it does not want to stick to its Sesseln. 
They want to reassure the angry group and the party lines that after the Bavarian “tsunami” in view of the loss of the absolute majority personal effects demanded a day. 
Five years ago, admitted, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber standing at his career high point, the christian social union reached 60.7 percent. But now, they could provide a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of the votes. 
The CSU was 46 years “Alleinregierer” in Bavaria, which gained 18 percent of germany's Gross Domestic Product. 
The conservatives remain will have in the future to govern the dominant force in the southern state of important for the Hungarian economy, in a coalition. 
The first sign of the party restructuring the potential successors Hubers, also included vice-president and federal Agriculture minister Horst Seehofer into the investigation team that with the liberal FDP, or the “free voter right-wing” exploratory discussions about a possible coalition Munich leads. 
It is an irony of fate that with the list “free voters” that Gabriele Pauli arrives in the legislative period, whose anti Stoiber appearance used Huber Beckstein duo first in order to get rid of the targeted politician ruthless. 
The christian social union leaders are now concentrating all its forces on the strengthening of Beckstein. 
During this transition Stoiber, which held so far, the threads in the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called 28 September “bitterest day of his political career.” 
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic remarks towards the CDU, according to him, the CSU deserved more support from the sister party. 
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and hence at Angela Merkel. 
If the christian social union, which contributed 2005 at national level to success, not in a joint effort the legs to be asked, Merkel can not become the next elections 2009 September chancellor again. 
Merkel, who has made no secret of his disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the terrain loss of the christian social union will not affect the grand coalition in Berlin. 
But it is relative: The wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues. 
With 18,6 percent of the SPD achieved so far, his best result in Bavaria since 1946. 
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0 
With the elections on Sunday, it has created a member of the opposition in the Ukrainian parliament. 
Russian observers believe this is to illegalnesses because of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, the OECD suspected but during the counting of the votes. 
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections. 
De Legislatur of 10-million-inhabitant state gets along for decades without opposition. However, those expected the other party before the elections, yesterday taken under the name “united democratic forces” (ODS), insisting that Lukashenko, who has renewed his presidential mandate in the elections and negligent, thanks to a constitutional amendment 2006 for the fourth time this time, some members of the opposition in parliament “allow” has become. 
That is why the ODS took away from the boycott planned before. 
Ukraine is economically increasingly dependent, thanks to rising prices for natural gas imports from Russia. To alleviate the price increases even loans were included, and the country also agreed to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the country's top of the gas pipeline to the Russians. In the context of the expectations of the opposition was the hope that wanted to improve Ukraine their relationship with the European Union, after Lukashenko and other senior politicians have because of than anti-democratic classified political system in the European Union refused entry. 
For a temporary detente analysis of the election of the OECD, which was an emphasis on the positive movements, rather than on the shortcomings, such as only a third of the opposition candidates from the elections. 
But the high-speed report of the OECD has criticized the campaign, so opponents will not occur in the press, and especially the fact that on Monday, the opposition could not be present during the counting of the votes. 
For all that the opposition is able to an improvement in the political system recognizes: Political prisoners were set for instance at large, and Minsk is ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow, by refusing further appreciation of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of south Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia and Ukraine on paper forms a federal state, which considers both areas for a month as an independent. 
“We made two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union started,” said Alexander Milinkevich to our story. 
In view of the opposition candidate for the presidential elections of 2006 a continuation is desirable, although “got the powerful fear, only an opposition in parliament to leave.” 
The opposition does not plan protest actions in light of the results to show tried but rather the need for economic reform to the voters. 
“We have many problems, the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the distribution of obstacles in the way, but that more and more people support the change, however, see even the older,” Milinkevich said in reference to the fact that not even the usually-supported layer of pensionists agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only credit is the production of social security. 
“Thanks to the debt of the country and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before “social security with-suspecting, according to the silence of a cemetery began to crumble,” so to Milinkevich. 
Unlike the opposition politician Russian observers called the democratic elections. 
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the commonwealth of independent states Ria Novosti told the press agency: “People believe the deeds, not words.” The absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the belarus voters. 
Brunetta: “From now on, having breakfast before the work” 
For the first time in the history of the Palazzo Chigi there are swivelling doors for the entrances and exits of officials. 
From now on, the measure will step against that smartaleck into force which brand and go during working hours coffee only. 
The new "anti-sluggard law” was presented to the Minister for public administration today by Renato Brunetta, and by Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the presidency of the Council of Ministers. 
“Swivelling doors are a means to increase the efficiency of a higher profile quota and more services” that Minister Brunetta. 
“A new era of responsibility and transparency. 
This is” reformism underlines Brunetta again. 
With the Palazzo Chigi ends the installation in all buildings of the presidency of the Council of Ministers. 
Masi resources for this: “the choice of swivelling doors is symbolic of great value.” 
On the part of the staff there was no resistance, assured the Secretary-General: “This process has been supported by cooperation came from all sides.” 
All in all, there is now no breakfast during working hours more; End of Coffee or Croissant. 
Brunettas advises in connection with a smile: “A good cappuccino at 7 a.m works wonders.” 
During a meeting of senior committee of public administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione) 
in Rome, the Minister announces that “within three months, the absences of officials reduced to 50%, 60,000 people per year at work here.” 
It adds that it is necessary to increase the efficiency of public administration in Italy 
“their wage Dynamiken, so the Minister, was twice as large 8-10 in recent years as the private sector and the inflation rate.” 
Meanwhile, thousands of officials, together with the Brunetta decree within the framework of the appeal against input supported by Codacons. 
“During the Ministers for public service with figures on smaller absences in work formed, consumer center, says the people grows “transacts sluggards” steadily. 
Indeed thousands together right and valuable officials of the public service to declare the illegal standards of the decree war.” 
In particular, the regional Administrative Court (TAR) for additional financial reconciliations for work-related illness fighting; so the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick workers workers, who control during visits and other aspects of the innovations of the Minister can be challenged. 
Napolitano: “Prevention of industrial accidents is crucial” 
Each day happened in Italy 2500 accidents, three people die and 27 remain lifelong invalids. 
For the year, the data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirmed that 2007 fatal accidents were with about 1200. 
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that nearly twice as many deaths are caused by through killings. 
Today the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy, the 58 will commit. national day for the victims of accidents to draw the attention of the social institutions and media on this tragic situation. 
“The worrying data and the tragic news of these days spread by Anmil confirm how crucial question of prevention in the workplace. ”, the president of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his report to the president of the Amil (Associazione mutilati alliance party invalidi del lavoro) confirms Pietro Mercandelli. 
The head of state expresses his “great appreciation for the ongoing commitment to prevent on jobs, for the protection of the injured workers, to the aid for the families of the victims and the awareness of the public opinion.” 
“An angry “Basta” rose to that; understandably with tragedies that, due to their size, some stir in the media and release sympathy for the public. But the daily reality confronts us frequently with dramatic events that may even be repeated in their momentum.” 
Napolitano does not hide that “there is also a resource problem: it must be invested substantially in education and information.” 
The numerous initiatives for a more direct awareness take a special significance in school framework on the part of the young people who feed themselves the workplace, on. 
It is our duty to direct and not distract from his social Serious attention to this phenomenon. We must set and improve a legislative standard into violence. 
For its part, the president of the chamber Gianfranco Fini has stressed “like the phenomenon of work-caused deaths a pressing social emergency forms that insults and all institutions, forcing the conscience of all of us to work towards rules agreed with the goal, the problem to put an end.” 
“The data of industrial accidents seem to indicate a slight improvement, this does not exclude but that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,” says a president of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli. 
“We do not want this “positive trend meant” less attention. Causes at the end of the tragedy.” 
“As it believes that it is doing too little reason to counter the phenomenon of the accidents. You can fight by various actions against it. 
Stronger controls and inspections are our view as necessary that Mercandelli; but even stronger measures to inform the workers who are starting at school.” 
“Another effort is required, puts it, but also about communications and the awareness of the public opinion. 
But above all a greater sense of responsibility is in demand on the part of the employers with a phenomenon, which is a social hardship,”. 
Mercandelli arrived to refer to it as “the progressive deterioration of protection for the accident victims prangerte” and “the abolition of the social security system, which we are fighting over the last few years.” 
“The objective is not to return to the worker workers a guarantee to insurance in the fate of the victims of an industrial accident on voluntary or accidental donations, which are determined by time by a lawmaker, becoming dependent”. 
Mp3-Player under indictment: Risk of hearing damage 
Read music over a longer period of portable music devices such as. Mp3-Player to hear can lead to permanent marred hearings. 
It asks the European commission, to quote the opinion of the Csrseri (scientific committee on the current and recently identified health risks) by the European Union in a report distributed today in Brussels. 
“From the report, in a word, it is clear that 5 10% people who at least five years weekly hear more than one hour a day out loud music on portable music equipment that risks permanent loss of their hearing.” 
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who have usually portable music devices and mobile phones to a high volume to know irreparably damaged his hearing without it,” Meglena Kuneva. 
“From the scientific findings, as it says on the part of the European Union, is a clear risk, which is pushing to act quickly. 
What really matters is to make consumers and to make this information common property. 
We need to review the tax systems already exist in light of this scientific knowledge, they are very effective and with the new technology step.” 
Brussels had instructed the independent scientific committee in view of the widespread use of mobile music devices among young people. 
“The scientists, the report of the EU closes, confirming that it is right to be worried, and that the EU commission will investigate the necessary measures now, along with other European Union-members and people, children and young people are better protected against the noise from mobile music devices and similar devices will be able.” 
It is currently has a European standards, which limits the level of the noise of portable music devices on 100 railways. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise pollution. 
One can limit the damage, in which a range of solutions, such as the reduction of the volume and the length of the noise suspension. 
In its report, the scientific committee of the European Union, points out that, if the user hear of portable music devices only five hours a week loudly (louder than 89 decibels) music, so that the legal limits are already exceeded that hold relative to the maximum noise at work. 
Those who cross the border, music, putting the total loss of hearing within five years. 
That would affect 5 10% users of such devices, whose number of between 2,5 and 10 million people in the European Union can be considered. 
Roma, Alemanno gives the green light to the “commission for the future of the capital” 
Today we start March, should it be over, June balance are held. 
That is the procedures for the work of the “commission for the future of the capital Rome” set by the Capitol. The commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla hot springs. 
In six months, the president's Marzano and the other 49 members of the commission will prepare the leaders in Rome. 
As soon as the project will be completed, the city and the local council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present in order to be able to June, the strategic plan for Rome with the “official stamp” of the Capitol and the mayor Gianni Alemanno. 
“The commission is totally independent and all political, social and cultural views are represented in it,” - Alemanno stressed. “You proposals for a development plan for Rome will offer, whose political leaders and the city council. 
It is not a redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where we can build a great project for Rome. 
Their March job will be finished and the commission will again be dissolved, since such project must have a certain end point. 
For June, the mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan, in which we will use the work done by the commission”. 
Who questions the authority of the commission because they believe that lack of commitment, Alemanno answers: “Everything depends on the work that will bear the commission and the quality of its proposals. 
If, as in France, the commission, Attali supplies qualityful results, and this will certainly be in Rome, the case, then their contribution will be fundamental. 
Too often the policy is dealing with the day-to-day issues and concerns that arise from time to time. 
We, on the other hand, are to have a longer period in the face, even in a deeper perspective to the development of Rome and the future of the city of work.” 
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to determine the following “the commission is neither an ineffective mechanism, another wreck: it is not completely free, Roman citizens a cent and will cost us to thinking. It will make the best heads of the capital. 
According to Alemanno “it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static, to make it possible for our city a jump in quality, which he really needed, and such a step into the future to do.” 
A future, so the mayor of Rome, which are not only limited “the current local borders, but many will continue to look”, not just in the role of Rome metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.” 
Obama, the first anti-American president? In a statement 
A well-known American politician who close to it, as an independent, wrote: “Barack Obama becomes a second anti american president. 
The first was Jimmy Carter, that its decisions, the economy of the united states and decimated by befeindeten Islam maintained relations (and this very day as a private citizen is).” 
The attacks against Obama are becoming more sharply, right now, when the elections approach. 
A woman from Miami wrote in a web page: “This person is full ambitions. 
Obama is very outrageous: he thinks it the highest office of a nation will receive a total of those two black governors and five black senators saw!”. 
In fact, these attacks do not have to say much; this is a racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the electorate: he will be a good president? And then there are the questions; all say that Obama with a big lead will win. 
In this case, there are people who speak with heart and not in the head. 
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deep south of the United States, wrote in her in the Editorial: only in the voting booth we will probably know the real American patriot will give its voice to whom. 
A mentality of the united states shows that was followed by lastly hidden. 
“Say what you want, then we will decide, for whom we will make our Kreuchen whether Obama or McCain.” 
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will migrate from America. 
Something that we have never before, but now that the success is sure to black candidate. 
In any case, despite all the considerations, the ultimate weapon for democrats is George Bush. 
1500 People were asked: The mistakes have Bush committed during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq. 
America changes. 
The nation has lost 50000 soldiers in Vietnam and with a kick in the back was sent home. 
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers have died and the Americans forced to tackle. 
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of the weakness by Bush. 
That will take its place, faces a formidable task. 
The united states. The financial collapse has left its mark on journalists: In the newspapers one can feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the “murderer” of the written press. 
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by the PEW Research center on their situation and their mental control in the future. 
Today, nearly all journalists are pessimistic that their future. 
But they did not explain to people responsible for that information about the real concern because of the general credibility. 
They do not feel alone as before. 
The problem for the American journalists is the money. 
The 2008 crisis is for these journalists a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed. 
In addition, the major problems come through the cuts in the area, meeting the Newsroom, in which journalists working for making the newspaper. 
This is a problem to be solved, so the interviewten journalists, if one wants to ensure that the traditional journalism, as the great public understands it passes not significantly. 
A clear but complex pessimism meets today the American journalist. 
Six of ten journalists and senior Executive of the written press are of the opinion that the journalism nationally on the wrong way. 
In the local area there is with the Executives even to the 65%. 
Printed vs. broadcasts. 
It is not difficult to journalists to imagine the direction the Web. 
The most important publishing groups to clear the way for the Internet, which is considered the written press by many as the “killer.” 
The “economic pressure” that the journalists, rose by up to 79%. 
The 500 interviewten journalists admitted to want to join the new technology in hope “bring something positive for journalism.” 
The biggest rift is the American journalism today between the editors-in-chief newsroom and reporters who work for it. 
56% of the editors-in-chief nationally are safe, their reporters share their values with them, while there is locally only 23%. 
Some think it has with “security in the work” to do. 
To lose their jobs within three years amount to 47% nationally have the plant manager, fear. 
With the journalists there is 30%. 
The issue of the “safe” work in the team (our “editors,” said D. Talk) is always in the united states a current issue. 
Only 13% of the journalists working under contract. 
In a vast nation, as the united states, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers and magazines, radio and TV-transmitters and Internet service providers, offer employers like it to them, it is a question of take it or leave it in such a way. 
Getting very often very high salaries, the editor of it sometimes only 10000 euros per month can get the editors-in-chief, pensions and insurance premiums. 
As for the holidays, the issue is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after third, in order to achieve after a number of years 15 holiday days. 
But the American journalists will admit, like them, in the course of the year, often “sick”. 
It is a question of climate. 
UNIPOL: THE IN COURT ROM: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA 
The president of the second criminal courts of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent. It had requested from Grottaferrata to Rome to be moved. 
It becomes bank red against Coppola because of within the framework of the investigation into the Gegenvereinbarung in the case of the takeover of Unipol Bnl. said. 
In the course of the trial in the last week, his release from house arrest was transformed into a residence forced into Grottaferrata. 
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent of the provincial town in an apartment in the capital to be moved. 
According to the court such transfers (against the public prosecutor's office had spoken out) would give it the ability to influence its society and to reach it suspects evidence. 
The elite is in danger 
The phenomenon had revealed a few days ago, when the chamber of deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar austerity package of the white house: Much of the Americans was and is more interested to punish Wall Street than the economy to save. 
This confirms the spending of yesterday by the New York Times, which reports of it, like the crisis in the laufschritt republican party shared that divides more and more in its old and moderate East Coast soul that always encouraged the national institutions and business community and that neoconservative, to “those in Washington,” and the financial world hostile and voter wins v. A. in the south and central to the states. 
That part of the party owes its ascent v. A. the voice of what I mentioned above. 
This just mentioned example is now only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even is already: only in the united states, including in the entire west and perhaps even beyond those that they will not be affected. 
In both states and in Europe the crisis seems to accelerate the long feared events that accept and come to light in these new conditions finally taking shape. 
The first of these phenomena are the latest discovery, the outrageous Renaissance of the state in connection with a sort of re-nationalization of the economy. 
Indeed, the crisis is a collapse of the banking and financial institutions that close links to the outside world and have a tremendous amount of the fortunes of private households managing at the same time, living in a single state. 
This means a direct political problem for the governments: indeed, as compared to the families concerned to withhold applies, whatever represent a huge mass of voters. 
The crisis is so global economically, politically against it is almost purely national. 
The political internationalism appears to have actually been lagging sidelined and its right to speak have lost: The obvious evidence of this was commissioned by the European Union, which does not know how to find a common way because of its division into different national and international conflicts. 
That is why all now count on the intervention of the state; Rescue plans, new rules, and v. A. distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis has become more serious, the united states in the economic situation will only be saved without foreign aid. 
And apart from the money they have also this legitimacy to use: not so two conditions, under certain circumstances, which can be exaggerated, an international organization or otherwise market will probably be able to draw in a similar manner. 
The new emphasis on the national-national element, moreover, is in complete agreement with the increasingly important, which has recently moved into the economy with one on closest relatives sector in context: the territoriality. 
Paradoxical way is it just now, when we were so convinced, long an interconnected global empire to have entered into an empire of technologies, always differentiated non-material one that we must determine at once, how our future will depend more and more on the main material things: Water, harvest and oil. 
They can certainly be transported across a place at the others in the world, but are still at most associated with a narrow described piece earth, a territory. 
So what has such a territory, is another opposite who lives in a crop yields, waterless or oilfields free zone in the advantage. 
Turning to the second novelty, which requires a brief modules. 
The territory, which says government who says politics, it also Leadership. 
In this sense, the financial crisis appears to produce two converging phenomena. 
On the one hand, there is the awareness of the need for eighth Leaderships, hence the need for anyone who knows how to govern. 
On the other hand, now a wave of indignation insists that the existing leadership, v. A. economics, as inadequate and full black spots appeared. 
In addition, a deep finally more lange and aspect still worrying in some sense: A loss of confidence, an intolerance, a picture of the inexpediency, a feeling of distance, all together towards a whole class of managers of the western countries. 
It is clear that the conviction in large parts of the population in the way that not only the actions of the social elite, but his idea world, their Way OF Life, their culture are in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is largely as increasingly strange and more traditional. 
The demand for Leadership that feed a tube branched but powerful movement of the withdrawal of the power of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unexpected “revolts” voter and the sudden reversal of the collective heart condition of the last time: beginning with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, on the collapse of the labour party in Britain, for the uprising of the American members against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right here in Italy plays a part). 
One wins the impression that the old elite, their parties, its programs, but its rites, magazines, intellectuals lender, has some people would say its format, more and more understanding problems and thus less representative worth about what is and is strengthened and driven up to about dimensionality from the financial crisis today in the lower social classes of the west. 
In light of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a “uprising of the masses.” 
But the eye to keep a wide open but it is certainly not. 
The superadhesive that leaves at walls lift-off 
To defeat and walls to climb up the forces of the force of gravity, thanks to an adhesive like Superman. 
This is the subject of four American research centre, one of which are now apparently almost at the end. 
With one on a surface adhesive applied to only 2.5 qcm researchers have succeeded in drawing 100 kg heavy senkrechten body on a wall. 
That STUDIO, an American magazine, the results of the researchers at the university of Dayton, Akron, Georgia institute OF Technology and the air Force Research Laboratory published. 
The real invented by the research team is an evolution of the adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, already used, called carbon nano-tubes. 
“We can present the principle of adhesive like a series of a pile of Spaghetti ranked tubes”, declared themselves Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia institute OF Technology in Atlanta. 
Scientists are the feet of the Geckos covered by microscopic villi be inspired by giving a complete halt to the animal. 
The tests with different materials such as glass and teflon sandpaper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times higher, as the ability to preserve the feet of reptiles and at the same time, “easily from the wall to leave” Liming Dai, researchers of the faculty for engineering sciences at the university of Dayton. 
AT WALLS ENTLANGWANDERN? “It could be used as a crime,” adhesive Liming Dai rates. 
Currently up-happen in order as Spiderman at walls? Perhaps, but the researchers believe instead of a less exciting use, such as the context of electrical appliances, because the nano-tubes are as leaders of heat and electricity. 
Other areas of operation could fall into the area of space. 
For the moment the superheroes are still waiting. 
The OTHER KIND of RESEARCH, including the university of Berkeley, California, on a new kind of adhesive. 
In an article of the American Chemical Company the California scientists present an adhesive from microfibers like hair by movement on the surface of the dust clean and so perfect liability always intact. 
Drug: never with fruit juice take 
Caution before grapefruit, orange and apple juice. 
These drinks that are consumed by their refreshing quality and its vitamin wealth v. A. in the summer, can cause serious health problems when they were taken at the same time, with some essential medicines, since they can affect the inclusion of these by the body in extreme. 
David Bailey, professor at the University OF Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to risk more wrapped like fresh fruit juices in connection with medicine income. As part of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia it beat alarm again: A glass apple orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the capacity of certain essential medicines so far that these are virtually eliminated and the health of patients at risk. 
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion to be responsible for the consequences of some drugs such as antibiotics, Antiasthmatika, cardiovascular anxiolytischer medicines and neurological means to rise up to toxic levels. 
MEDICINES IN DANGER - the same agency of the drug had warned and had stressed that Mixes in a report of two years of doctors and patients before the dangers to pay attention to what is drunk in connection with resources such as Diazepan or Metadon. 
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT, listen to the experts also contain orange juice and apple juice substances which could hamper the drugs. 
The list of molecules restrained by fruit juices is long. 
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, the director of the Università Statale di Milano: “These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who it is open to change the consumer information. 
It is always wise to read and, if there is still unclear, no shyness have the package insert a pharmacist or a doctor asking” emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency. 
Nobel prize in economics at Paul Krugman 
The Nobel prize in economics is the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activity. 
The 55 year old Krugman is a neo Keynesian, that at the university of Princeton teaches and known for its regular articles for the New York Times. 
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of economic and foreign policy of the Bush administration. 
A few months after the attacks of 11 September 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, had Krugman an editorial in the New York Times said, the second event has been crucial in the history of the united states as the attacks. 
A perspective that did not receive little controversy in response, and the economist still years later they claimed, but today it is absolutely right. 
“I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron and Worldcom from the public attention disappeared,” said Krugman at the end of 2002. 
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the executive board of the European central bank is Krugman a “economist of great value”, but also a Banalisierer with a “very aggressive style, particularly draws up against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.” 
Open Office, it is the third version of “anti-Microsoft” package 
The day of the publication of OpenOffice.org 3,0 arrived; open-source software is a growing number of Usern, both at home and in the office as free replacement for Microsoft Office, both in free support and in public administration. 
After a year of intense work by voluntary developers, which is controlled by Sun Microsystems, the new open Office is the public with some novelties: apart from a revised and now more Spartan ordered primary menu, finally one reason is made to ensure compatibility with of Apple operating system Mac OS x, as well as the support for the new ODF (open document format) 1,2 format, the latest standard ISO version. 
In addition, eight were around on the compatibility with Microsoft Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx.xlsx.pptx) by OpenOffice to be read. 
Some also interesting new phenomena, one that will allow it to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations that such an easier way via e-mail. This is also the possibility pdf files counts in diagram working on modules to import and at the same time, the original appearance of the side to preserve. 
So now “hybrid” Pdf files can also be generated by extending the typical diagram of Adobe format by the elements of a table and a text processing system. 
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of applications: Tables can now more-handle by various Usern to be handled with conflicts have avoided when change; in the case of the text processing system Frabe is assigned to each editor to ensure better corrective action. 
Some companies are about to publish other functions of OpenOffice over the Internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks, the final result is to be made public. 
The Italian version is available on the left to download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. It follows the English version on Friday mirrors. 
Except for Windows and Mac OS the program is available for the Linux operating system. 
Following a request to be able to send the installation cds home or in the office. 
Meanwhile, if the freeness can be an incentive for the spread of the program in the private sector, it is precisely in the area of the Business, where the OpenOffice great success could manage: finally, already various mechanisms of public administration and schools switched to OpenOffice. 
In fact, it is not even a lack of training offer, which means an optimal support for small and medium-sized enterprises, and even business prospects. 
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, " appropriate Texterstellungsprogram; The Calc Tabellenprogram aimed at a forced repatriation of Excel; Impress, for the production of presentations with Powerpoint; Dbase for the operation of databases, instead of the more well-known ACCESS; and last Draw a diagram modules. 
The goal for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads, a goal that can be easily exceeded 3 million have already achieved and 600 thousand. 
Also tested positive Kohl and thus fourth case of doping 
A new case of doping mi framework of the last Tour de France opens: this is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, that as third-classified and winners of the jersey of the best mountain climber. 
The news published the newspaper L'Equipe on their website. 
The 26-year old Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver who positively to Cera, which has been tested Epo of the third generation. Before this already angry with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, as well as the German Stefan Schumacher. 
The analysis of the blood tests Kohl among those who were made in recent weeks by the laboratories fate and Anna Chatenay Malabry. 
If the evidence to confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and for two years from the race to be excluded. 
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and inform according to Associated Press the Austrian leaders. 
In addition, the 26-year old Austrians rose behind the Spaniard carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium and claimed the jersey of the best mountain climber for itself. 
TOPIC IMMIGRATION: NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: ITALY IS RACIST ONE? 
Italy, “the former country of immigrants has recently became one of the key countries for immigrants” who are accepted only reluctantly. 
This from the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is the New York Times in a long article devoted entirely and starts from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre born of Burkina Faso on the issue of racism in Italy, a month ago in Milan, was killed after a packet of cookies had been stolen. 
The case shows what calls the Times “paradox of the north”: the northern regions are those in which “most integration and employment opportunities exist,” and “the highest degree of anti-immigrationistischen sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega nord to register are”. 
As confirmation of the growing tension between italy and immigrants, the Times refers to further episodes of intolerance of Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno. 
And not just that. 
The new legislation on immigration and to accelerate the expulsion of illegal immigrants from the Lega, is described as a sign of climate change in Italy. 
A movement, whatever the Pope and the president stress: “Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope during a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between church and state to combat racism.” 
Students victims of the rental prices high until 900-Euro per room 
The market for housing for students do not know crises. 
According to a recent study by the Sunia tenant, the trade - union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome. 
“This phenomenon has already very serious courses. All students in droves so actually losing their right to study, as their families are not able to it in this amount to back - up to the leaders of the Sunia, Laura Mariani,“in those cities have the great demand on the part of the students to a deformed of the market, which damaged the other residents. 
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations. free contracts, missing filings without rent border, bad subtenancies. 
For the Sunia the need for exceptional measures that result from a review of taxation to lower rents. 
During closer inspection of the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a sleeping in the Brianza approximately 450 euros are needed; a single room begins with 650 euros (in the quarter of gang Nere) and ends with 800 euros in the quarter, Lambiate Fiera Udine, or 900 euros in the Vittoria. 
In Florence, a sleeping place costs, a room 700 on average, 350/400 euro. 
In Bologna, where the students focus in the districts of the university, 250/280 euro for a sleeping place of emergencies, 370 to 500 for a single room. 
In Rome, the prices in the districts be higher at around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping in a double rooms. 
Rents are only a little deeper in the districts of the other universities in Rome. 550 Euros in Ostiense and Cinecittà. 
Only those who evades in outlying districts can save money: 300 Euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar accomodation. 
In Naples need one 300-450 euros for a sleeping, for a room is the price between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive districts, the Policlinico, and Vomero Colli Aminei. 
In Bari a sleeping place costs, a single room at least 350 to 250-350 euros. 
In the smallest towns prices are lower, but they greater weight in the urban economy. 
In the cities, where the phenomenon of letting is more frequent to non-European students, such as in Perugia, another anomaly even exists: the rent 25-30% be above average, by foreign students are required. 
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso, the towns close their historic cinemas 
The historic cinemas close due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas. 
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.” 
The image of the producer Giuseppe Tornatore describes in effect that currently in large urban areas of Italy, and also in the provinces, happens. 
The process of the exclusion of cinemas, with the birth of the great multi-hall complexes in the periphery began, ultimately death chamber for a cinema in the center. A process that does not seem just inevitable and irrevocable, but also has the ability to a cultural crime. 
Usually historical sites, full of memories, “it will look like a friend to be lost, with whom we have a piece of street full of emotion,” the producer of the film “Cinema Paradiso Nuovo” which brought in 20 years ago Oskar and the high price of Cannes for it. This is the story of a suburb of cinema and his nostalgia composed to live in a world of cinema lost forever. 
The figures, which are the Anec, central trade association, provides a clear language: in the last five years, the huge amount of 316 traditional cinemas to close had; mostly cinemas in the large cities paid this bill: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo. 
The worst affected regions the Emilia Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41. 
This shows that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely those three areas where the largest number of these modern cinemas was registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, the state Lombardy lists 81 are both in Tuscany and Emilia Romagna. 
“The business has in an irrational way developed” that Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, “it is useful for new structures, but in the first place is the preservation of the existing already because fills a warehouse in the city, is not all its regular customers to visit in place of an old multiplex cinema in the periphery. 
And even the lack of budget for the fund of trade association remains outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state amounted to approximately 10 million. 
It is a shame ethical-moral from the position that the government does not consider the existing laws. 
In order to preserve the sector would be between 16 and 18 million in the year of emergencies.” 
The case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which decided because of fears for the old cinemas to protect these by an agreement between the community and the Anec is interesting; this is the first of its kind in Italy, which seeks to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historic center, and in the periphery. 
Under the anticipated tax measures to give preference to the cinema operators and benefits to the public are on the transport: it will be allowed to go into the traffic-limited areas of central and also park to better parking fees. 
“It is a good initiative” Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that our other towns, and will be followed by a new approaches to elaborate beyond that. 
But there is no doubt that we need a better audio and video equipment, in order to be able to concentrate on the superpower the multiplex halls, because the public is now more ambitious. 
Defending the traditional cinema was always for me an important issue: the closure of the “Supercinema” of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the key point, which brought me to create the “Nuovo cinema Paradiso” even if I had already played for 10 years with the idea. 
For 25 years I live in Rome; if I pass at the Rialto or at the Quirinale through in the Alliance, where I have seen so many different emotions, turning to the side, so as not to have to see the dust-covered posters. 
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro 
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the decisions of the community to the interests of the mafia group of Piromalli. 
The accusations of the bar of the anti-mafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone community Tauro Gioia, who was arrested this morning because of involvement in mafia shops are serious. 
Also in handcuffs Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clans and public administration was taken, as well as his nephew: the lawyer who as the head of the clans bears the same name, had already been convicted of involvement in criminal groups of the mafia, then to the amount of damages of 10 million. 
“Disrespect”, the lawyers write any kind of moral and legal standard, “the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli of funds for advisory activities.” 
“It was made possible by the mafia, so the judges, on official in the town halls to penetrate and the policy of public administration to help.” 
The president of the regional committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not answer denying that it is in their region “anything but an exception, links from local governments and organized crime to encounter.” “There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in other countries where such connections are virtually inevitable. 
But there are also local politicians who resist pressure from the 'Ndrangheta: Heroes, the white waistcoat keep.” 
The arrests this morning with those of the past July, which according to the police clan Piromalli was beheaded. 
Since the end of last April local council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but even 1991 - and even at that time because of alleged links between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians from their local offices had been dismissed. 
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of Udc, was elected the next round of 2006 to the head of the center-right coalition. 
He wept as the prefecture the dissolution of the municipal council to scandal. 
He sued on them into a vice-Minister of Interior Marco Minniti he accused politico everything for strategic reasons to have invented. However, the judges ruled this morning in connection with the arrest warrant today that the Piromalli clan it had even dared to request a change of A3-Projektes. 
From a bugging campaign in connection with the investigation of the case Dal Torrione, showed a willingness to accommodate the desires of business that is known as a representative of the large group of the Piromalli real and the actions of the public administration to the interests of the clan was identical.” 
If the energy rose from the waves, suddenly the great accumulate 
It is not drying up on a financial resources that about 70% of the surface of the planet and that only the large energy companies in the world seems to understand. 
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources in all this, and also to show about search giants such as Chevron. 
The possibility of gaining power from the movements of the sea is already considered and tested for 70 years. it is no coincidence that tightened up these studies since the first oil crisis considerably. 
As the price of oil by 1980 vergas one broke in the idea of the sea energy, but now the pressing environmental organizations and the rise in oil prices on new momentum in this sector. 
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves. 
This would be the double energy currently generated by nuclear power plants. 
In addition, the currents and tides would come. 
Basking in the attack. 
The first company, which is now on the sea energy is Enersis who signed a treaty in the year 2005 for the establishment of a power station in northern Portugal. 
As this message appeared it was issued a revolutionary step. 
Two years later, it is now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, which number power production at the navy. 
“Chevron examines these technologies, known as the spokesman, US giant of business in the Wall Street Journal, and balances the opportunity for us to work out.” 
It is about obtaining permission from the American energy commission that is needed to launch a project off the coast of Alaska. 
This is not a sign that can be underestimated, v. A. considering that just continue to Alaska oil is supported by the united states and president Bush recently put the plans for new drillings. 
Besides Chevron also the companies are Verdant power Inc. from New York and Ocean power from New - Jersey who invest in the new industry; although the details are not known, observers speak of a rising interest. 
Even improvement-worthy technologies. 
Experts are themselves from one another in the departure of finding technology, not least because not yet recent concerns are resolved by environmentalists. 
So far, projects are not like this one in Portugal and Scotland on a small scale and seem any environmental problems that can be taken seriously. 
In order to produce energy, but on a large scale, it requires technologies with far more influence on the environment. 
There are other options: Ocean power about using a system of associated buoys. 
The thrust of the waves, which puts the buoys ups and downs, is implemented in the hangs over pistons and cylinders into hydroelectric pressure. 
That propels a turbine performing a generator. 
The river is sent to it on underwater pipelines to the coast. 
Up to now, there are four planned investments of this kind, which are just waiting for government approval. A portion of the won energy could also serve to military facilities. 
Meanwhile, Verdant power already produces energy for goods department store and a park rubber strip through submarine turbines in the East River in New York. 
The water flows during tides propels the turbines which spits by developing rotating boosts the generator. 
According to Verdant has a long queue waiting for possible clients for the necessary appropriations for these energy sources to use. 
Only the waves, tides. 
A special interest deserves the potential in tides according to the institute for power generation research at present. 
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are better than predictably wind currents, the sun and the waves, and therefore a more reliable energy source. 
The tidal energy is what brought Federal States such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states to have 7.5 million dollars in the year 2008 to invest, for 2009 are already scheduled for up to 35 million.
