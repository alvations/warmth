What they will do in Prague? CSSD knows Voldemorta or cukrárnu
New councilors capital from CSSD apparently will have to overcome some linguistic barrier to the Prague Council and Representation understand their re-elected colleagues from the ODS.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz members of the new Council of CSSD 'tried' notorious know how a slang that in a town hall was created during the last few years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
Kódovaný vocabulary that Prague political cream introduced during the previous era primátora Paul Béma, describes some of the best known characters, situations and trials in the city.
Surprisingly, it has emerged that the new councilors known terms too.
At least it says.
'Who is Voldemort?'
"I really do not know."
"I am in the Prague policy more nervousness," to respond to the test 'kmotrovského' slovníčku councilors for Culture Lukáš Kaucký.
And if it comes to a veteran of the political, responded similarly, councilors Karl Březina would.
For example, the concept of 'golf jamka'.
"This is the only expression of those who are giving me that sometimes I use '.
"Otherwise, I do not recognise the slang in general."
From slovníčku, whose expressions Aktuálně.cz newspaper, published in June this year, prior to the election the Congress of the ODS, has chosen office six examples, mainly those which are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrátem.
The Socialists should explain the terms' Voldemort, '' the biggest golf jamka in Prague ',' go into the ice cream parlors', 'bullish šíje', 'betrayal of the capital city,' and 'oplechovat'.
Three of the councillors agreed with kvízem, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, which is heading into the future pražskému education - first conversation has promised later but ignored the phone.
Five councillors Peter Dolínek straight test refused.
"All of these things, and it is as entertaining neřeším's Civic Democrats, not '.
'I now raising, as we understand it in the context of our programs, "he responded.
As already mentioned, councilors Lukáš Kaucký in heading for the supposedly nerozeznal that we are talking about the IPCC's influential entrepreneurs and friend exprimátora Béma Romano Janouškovi.
'Voldemort' Kauckému he says nothing, and the only date that the test correctly guessed, is' the greatest golf jamka in Prague.
"This is a tunnel Blanka Kaucký," he says, and adds: "But I know this more from the newspapers'.
"I'd have to pay a language course 'vtipkuje.
Golfovou jamku then as a tunnel Blanka administration dešifruje Karl Březina would not only matador, but councilors Environment Lukáš timid.
Both the Social Democrats know then who is really Voldemort and Lukáši Plachému familiar sounding is also where this figure to find - knowing the importance of the term 'go into the ice cream parlors ".
"I think this is to go to Prague, some of the business' is a timid close to deal with that, it is a seat Janouškových firms.
Pursuant to Březina recalls that knowledge načerpal rather than from newspapers to use such language.
In social democracy under frekventantů test zaběhnutý slovníček slangových no similar expressions.
"I am advised, with a colleague, but it seems that we have really no such thing. '
'We say more names, sometimes using the acronyms and distortions of names, "says the chairman of the Prague CSSD Peter Hulínský, whom straníci přezdívají Hulda.
'At school Bříza told me, but I do not know if they tell me and my colleagues, "admits to their own přezdívce Karl Březina would.
Newspaper Aktuálně.cz the name of the US, and it works.
Councilors Weinert is for Děda party people or less friendly Dědek, Miroslav zastupitel 'which to draw attention before the election fraud in the party, has in some sponzoringu colleagues dubbed the' Igráček '.
Přezdívky are also the only thing that the Social Democrats in vnitrostranické use language to admit.
Hulínský supposedly Huldu I hear, but the newspaper noted Aktuálně.cz and another nickname of the Prague minister.
'Doctor obuškového rights "supposedly recalls that Peter Hulínský won the title at JUDr. bratislavské police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture 'čarodějnic' issued a brochure
Women prohlášené in Burkině Faso for witch hunts have some common features.
Belongs to the older generation, unable to get into work, for example, for health reasons, are free and do not have children.
Those čarodějnicí 'will', it is sent to the isolation that do not jeopardise the rest of the village.
"The fate of this man to meet very rarely.
'Neodsouvají the young healthy women, because they help to work and give birth to children,' describes řádová sister, who is in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso old in a special house for more than a hundred women from their own ranks vyhostilo their community.
The local government has now against abnormal 'social' measures decided to act.
The information published a brochure, which should help limit the witch hunt.
But the thing is the rub.
"More than 70 per cent of adults in Burkině Faso cannot read," to draw attention to the disadvantage of written information The Standard newspaper.
Accusations of sorcery is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which with Burkinou Faso neighbouring last week died dvaasedmdesátiletá Ammy Hemmahová then, three women and two men tortured, polili petroleum markets and set fire to it.
The case told the BBC website.
The perpetrators claim that it was a case of bad luck.
The woman, according to their version of vznítil oil, which is used to rituálnímu anointing.
Vzplál supposedly, after a group of women to 'expel evil spirit'.
Isolation 'čarodějnic' support of the people, regardless of the level of educational attainment.
Newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from of Burkina Faso: 'Požíračky human soul was always the danger, "he said.
While in Burkině Faso, witch hunt trying to restrain the government, in the Gambia, even in the last year, it was the president himself.
'Gambijský Džammí president after the death of its tety unleashed a witch hunt, which is alleged to have had on her death and try to help kill the black art of the president himself. "
"To help, he enlisted witch doctors for help from near Guinea, who accompanied police officers, soldiers and personal ochranky president forcibly odváděli randomly selected men and women from gambijských villages on the farm in Kanilai, 'said in its report, Amnesty International.
On the farm to the imprisonment of people drink's brew of herbs with halucinogenními effects, which also causing intestinal problems and ledvinové.
The arrest of the two stay on the farm did not survive.
After international pressure was, in the end, almost a thousand prisoners released.
Bakalův nájemník: Mired in stoves, higher rent signed
Older podsaditý man has moved from the centre of the door klientského society RPG apartments' uhlobarona 'Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner nájemních apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, and was a component in the new lease agreement to three bytům: My, my daughter and my son, who is in a sentence.
All three precisely deregulation to raise my rent.
Instead 3 500 a month, the son of a will from next year have to pay for the apartment 2 + 1 second category 4100 kronor.
"There's no water and awash with must petrama (stoves on the rigid fuel, which Red.), 'it shows a man in a finger synově on the signing of the new treaty, which is full of power.
'But I signed it, "explains half-farmers naštvaně half-farmers and resignedly.
Civic associations BytyOKD.cz that new lease conditions is "incorrect and naughty, 'advises the tenants of the new Treaty nepodepisovat and wait until 7 December, when it will publish guidance on how to proceed.
But the man at the hands of just no matter.
'One says this, the other doesn' mračí.
Ostravsko is becoming a great laboratory of deregulation.
After New year ahead of the vast majority of homes in the Czech Republic have to rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit the laboratory 'to' personally.
The waiting room Havířovská RPG is one of a total of four on Ostravsku and on Tuesday at nine in the morning is already full.
Right next to the doors of the security agencies is ochranka and with her vyvolávací machine.
'Rent 2011', it is the special button on its dotykovém the screen.
One ťuknutí and from the machines by a paper with a number.
Nestihnete or read '157' and your figure already pípá on a large screen čekárny below the ceiling.
For a half seconds you are on the line.
To rent after a bit comes to ask the elderly couple will, bursts in the waiting room, but new leasing obviously not at all.
Most people came to solve common problems, such as ever - requests for repairs, insurance and similar events.
Letters with new contracts on Ostravsku nájemními are in the postal schránek tenants majority of a total of 44 thousand housing portfolio RPG around since the middle of November.
RPG apartments in letters suggests the increase in leased by 15% to 38%.
Special přepážka to new nájmům klientském was at the heart of open on 18 November.
"This is over a week, so it is only in its' running in 'period," worker in the bank after a moment of hesitation when the client will present as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakalovy former coal-mining condominiums are local incendiary topic.
Before the election it loudly enough took Vice-President of Parliament and a native ostravský Lubomír Zaorálek from CSSD, and even now it is the local newspapers full.
"Twenty years after them chcu a new floor '.
"Neither pos... Ana for me to záchodě nevyměnili, 'ulevuje in úvodou the man.
So far, most of the workers come from pensioners to be seen whether they will get a discount on leased from, if they sign up in time, the RPG in the special offer promises.
Half the discount to President of rent, will receive the other tenants, who will sign a new contract until 15 December.
Havířovská 'deregulatory' přepážka but questions definitely zahlcena is not.
"From yesterday's 360 clients here because of the leased for 2011 was only about 40 to 50 people, female 'estimate for the bank.
RPG on the Web and its nástěnkách proposes individual negotiating contracts where it is needed.
However, if the two sides cannot agree on a leased, it will have to establish an independent court.
"It is not threatening, but for information about the only possible and absolutely legitimate legal procedure," the attention of the RPG on their website.
"There is no judge will think, 'one of the workers RPG apartments, and the man in the street before klientským centre gives it partly right.
'I am 13 of thousands of pension and left me five thousand to eat, I have to try it, "he says.
But, after all, only znejistí worker immediately.
"We will see."
'Mr Zaorálek vzkazuje them in the media, whether nepodepisují and perhaps take a wait-and-see approach, "under consideration.
Rents at the end of regulation in most of the Czech Republic in the New Year of 2011, and RPG apartments is their increasing economic necessity.
"The rent is still below the necessary for simple upkeep of the housing stock," recalls Paul Klimeš rezidenčního, director of portfolio companies RPG apartments that naštvaným tenant has increased vytýkaná neglect the housing stock, according to homeowners is the main reason for the increase in rent.
While for the five years between 2005 and 2010 could RPG from rents apartments to invest in four billion in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is to be 5.2 billion.
Velkoplošná screen hanging on the ceiling by polstrovaným sedačkám havířovské čekárny yet repeats several be on red zvýrazněných information.
"An increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31 200 apartments, that is more than 90% of the homes' RPG.
"And it always will be the most about 7,50 metre square and just over $10 for a month," will appear on the screen.
Only in the 400 apartments from rent rises with RPG portfolio of 38 per cent.
"In these cases it is extremely low amounts to an increase of just over $10 a square metre 19,66, 'draws RPG.
In 2600 apartments will rent the same next year.
RPG condominiums promises that deregulation nevyžene nájmy skokově, but it will be distributed to four to eight years.
Moreover, adds a further commitment: All the money from the increase in leased (see chart) will give the company back into the homes, especially in the heat of the savings - new windows and insulation.
The priority is to get the people who sign up to an agreement on an increase in rent.
Agents to include školka, understand the architects
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brně is a new seat of society Arch.Design.
No one would have expected that hides also miniškolku with everything that entails - with colorful walls, a creative furniture kupou toys and even miniaturním Playground on outdoor terase.
Since October of last year, it may visit the children of employees Arch.Designu.
Projekčně-architektonická Arch.Design society, from whose ateliérů delivered a number of major brněnských buildings, in the direction of space for its corporate miniškolku since the first výkresů Avriopoint buildings.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly aged babyboomu and it was up to the fact that women projektantky and the architect can quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of zkrácených jobs is školka benefitem Arch.Design, which offers its employees in the context of social agenda.
Stavařky architect and so have the opportunity to combine the difficult job with care of the child.
Miniškolku, they made up the workers themselves Arch.Designu, and with the support of the leadership managed to get the subsidy of the European Union, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Corporate miniškolka is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational take resources and employment in the state budget and the Czech Republic.
Thanks to funding (grantovému subsidies amounting to 2, 8 million) can buy just over $10 facilities and equipment and for a period of two years to ensure qualified personnel and operations.
After the financial subsidies (2 years) is society Arch.Design duty for a period of 3 years to run miniškolku at their own cost.
The project has lasted for one year, with applications for the subsidy significantly helped the company by rating.
Care provides qualified personnel, the children having to be looked after all day long by a nurse and teacher MŠ in nurseries can beat children without age restrictions, but it is the majority of the older 3 years.
Because it is all about 'miniškolku', there may be only five children at the same time, during the day, but they are to be replaced by even more.
Traffic kindergartens is flexible according to the needs of parents and children all employees have the same right to use školku regardless of status in the hierarchy of the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, programmatic content in miniškolce is comparable with the Framework Programme pre-school education.
Children are here not only play, but is guaranteed and the quality of the teaching - from basic curiosity after training in school benches, is taught even the English language.
Class is not only equipped with toys, inspiring the Games, but also the computer, which children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can always check their child and fall stress situation vyzvedáváním delay children from nurseries remote from the workplace parents.
Parents and use the time more productively.
It is no surprise that this creates a naturally loyal relationship employee - an employer.
Arch.Design it has put to the Czech companies that offer significant benefit in recruiting new staff are friendly to the family and through this programme increased staffing marketing.
The house of the bones are fascinated by even after 100 years. A look at the spraying from Gaudího
The roof looks like other pravěkého ještěra, a staircase recalls the backbone of a dinosaur and balkony are open mouth of the fish.
This is the home of the Casa Batlló in Barcelona from the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudího.
From the local to the house because of its organic tvarům has dubbed the House of the bones.
Organic tvary, wild colors, unusual use of stone, debris kachlů and mosaic facade, reminiscent of šupiny and ubiquitous soft curves, all of this is typical of Antoni Gaudího at secession.
Průčelí house making fantasy line něžné colours and textury reminiscent of nature and animals.
In a detailed observation is geometričnost, rhythm and see exactly the right order.
On the night of the whole facade home sounds even more dramatic is nasvícená so that impression was further reinforced by colors luster.
Vinutí and shaking tvarů to the same extent in the interiérech.
Timber in waves mimics okenní bars zábradlí, ozdobné elements door, kukátka and lišty.
Batlló the house, which stands in the district of Eixample in an animated shopping street Passeig de Grácia No 43, rearranging the house in 1877 an architect from Emilio Sala Cortes.
Reconstruction has been going on for two years, and the house was completed in 1906.
Investor, rich industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and creating a completely new, but the idea soon adopted Gaudího to unusual and cheaper rebuilding.
Činžovní house Casa Batlló but Antoni Gaudí were not proposing himself.
Worked with him the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
On his projektantském prkně arose decorations for representational apartment owners of real estate, as well as the use of mosaic on this facade.
This facade has worked on many other creators and artists.
The work on the house, Casa Batlló -proposals successful cooperation Jujola with Gaudím.
Jujol was involved in the construction of the house, Casa Gaudího Milá Park Güell in which are further Gaudího works.
From the local to the house soon after the completion of the rise, thanks to its organic tvarům dubbed the "House of the bones'.
Others it due to the specific mechanism of opening windows started to call 'zívajícím house'.
It also says that, at the height of the building is vypodobněn sword of St George, saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motives include sochařské other elements of the building.
Gaudí into the house at the time of the proposed its unique system with odvětrávacími central heating vents and typical komíny.
Bizarre may seem their forty five stupňový tend to.
In the creation of Gaudí absolutely nerespektoval the building regulations and nenechával to tie them.
At the start of the building has received planning permission from the city, but he said the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, the council was in the process of finalising the zhrozena and asked for the result.
Radním care, for example, that the construction of its pillars and into public chodníku.
To rectify this never happened, on the contrary: Only 15 days after the challenge of urban areas, Josep Batlló successfully applied for (and won) permission to lease two top of the buildings.
The owner himself the man to step into the lower tiers.
In the gallery, in the second floor of a social salon and on the third floor of the ložnice and private part of the apartment.
The bottom was pronajato klenotnictví.
The whole house šestipatrový it crosses a staircase, which will give rise to the střešní terasu.
Major elements of the redevelopment was the abolition of all the genuine angles and direct lines and their replacement with zakřivenými walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of the intertwining of space.
The social part of the opening of the door completely salonních can connect and greater society together can comfortably to communicate without, at the same time, though privacy needed for intimnější talks.
The house with Gaudího rearranging won in addition to the new fronts also non-traditional roof and two floors.
Impressive Gaudího game is also the light blue and bíle glazované dlaždice, which is obložen Internal Auditors and světlíky.
Game two colours is the maximum amount of light in all echelons of the house.
It is enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects the light more than tmavá, which absorbs the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló the house, which was in 2005 included in the fund specialist Unesco world heritage, anyone can visit.
In the first floor of the house is nejprostornější and nejhonosnější be made available to the public.
Owners have chosen for this step up in 2002, on the occasion of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the birth of a famous designer.
In testing, because getting found out that this is a very good business, and searches of the spread of the common spaces and podkrovní, including střešní terasy.
Vstupné into memory is certainly not negligible, is 16,50 euros and students, pensioners and a group of holders of tourist průkazek have a 20% discount.
Greatly exceed the amount of the price of other Gaudího vstupného into buildings in the city.
If you want a taste of the atmosphere of the house with dračími věžičkami, you have to quickly skamarádit with some of the residents of činžáku and visit him directly at home.
How to choose and matraci rošt: Women have different requirements than men
Not honosný rám bed, but quality lehací area, thus matrace rošt, and provide the basis for a really good bed.
They must, however, the equable, to suit the specific users.
In selecting are a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health and gender owners.
It is also the kind of important, into which matrace and rošt are buying.
Typical example?
To be on the weekend where we regularly chalupy netopí, are not suitable latexové matrace, because it slowly 'zahřívají'.
Moreover, they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard polyuretanová matrace.
At the same time, the case needs to be regularly turn.
If they do not have a lot of odvzdušňovacích kanálků in the core, and even sits on the board of the firm, intercepted vlhkost: Could arise under them and blight.
In selecting are also custom.
Who spent a longer time in a foreign country, where it is often used to be a lot of high matrace změkčující layer, it is difficult to feel comfortable to be low, and with a hard surface.
"Perhaps all hokejisté, who returned from the NHL, I complained that nevyspí here. '
'On their shoulders otlučená, heels and boky needed matrace změkčující the layer of foam lazy'.
"This is to be recommended for people with diabetes, who have a disorder of the nervous system, so it is wrong," information from the joint and skin, "explains Sylva Hadamcziková, which specialises in čalouněný furniture.
Many hokejistům, but also other customers because matrace years ago with línou pěnou sháněla.
"Now this is in the humour, it has to be appropriate matrace Tempur, the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropico."
You do not have to be from the NHL borec to appreciate línou pěnu.
This "miracle" is simple.
Optimises its tuhost and shape according to absorbovaného heat or adjust your teplému body.
Nothing does not push you, in the night is not as převracet after a difficult match.
We are simply better vyspíte.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against proleženinami.
In selecting matrace add to the size of their level yet chodidla, which is the length of about 21 to 34 height.
A man and a woman with a height of around 180 height need Bed 210 to 220 height.
Minimum šířka for one should be for dvoulůžka 90 height, so together 180 height.
In separate nets, for example, recommends singlistů, at least 120 to 140 height.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule is simple: For the breadth of bed in camps on the back you should be comfortably in the hands of a slightly pokrčené lokti," advised ING. Helena Prokopová, cechmistryně Cechu čalouníků and dekoratérů, which is the subject of a healthy their sleep and ergonomie furniture pays for a number of years, and it's in the vocational schools.
For dvoulůžka needs every own rošt and matraci, however, be careful when buying, to reconcile matrací height.
Otherwise there would be nothing more than namontovat rošty in various high, however, you may not be able to each bed frame.
Pěnové matrace should have their height, with at least 14 types pružinovou kostrou at least 15, with at least three would počítejte on tvarovací and kypřicí layer.
'When dotyku of hands or landing at matraci pružiny certainly not feel, "warns Helena Prokopová.
Each matrace requires a certain type of roštu.
Celočalouněná bed when matrace and grounds are as srostlá siamská twins have in ložnicích what to do.
Matrace badly větrají cannot be vyprat their potah, which is no longer the case today.
And as for the night, normally vypotíme 0.2 to 0.75 l sweat of our, it is clear that after five to seven years, will start to resemble the one large matrace (and ucpané) sítko.
And that is why experts reject the advertising slogans about life matrací up to 25 years, or even a lifetime guarantee.
All, however, is their but.
And that is why the Council of practice from retailers: Matrací latitude to 120 and 140 height of hygiene and work snímatelný povlak nevzdávejte, but rather to add matracový chránič, which you can easily remove and vyprat.
Even though today routinely produce potahy matrací the zdrhovadly around the constituency, so after rozepnutí get two parts (for money and the size of a washing machine a lot of important!), yet could manipulation with larger types (and in one person) in taking the fight to lightweights in the ring with a heavy.
You are in bed instead roštu firm for?
Never!
A maximum of Bed for a visit to one of the night.
For, however, (if it is not already opatřete) větracími small holes and use matraci with pružinovou kostrou and height at least 15 height with pružinami in bags (from něm.Taschenfederkern) and kypřicí layer.
Polyuretanová matrace on this basis do not.
At nepolohovací lamelové rošty with 14 to 18 lamelami will appropriate latexové or sendvičové matrace (to be a combination of latexu and kokosu), but always paid rošty, with a greater number of lamel, 28, and more, are in the area where the lamely the shoulders of the twin and it is possible their tuhost to regulate.
At polohovací lamelové rošty not matrace with pružinovou kostrou because polohování unresponsive.
In addition to setting tuhosti lamel we can afford, and the so-called ramenní the cradle.
It is a special embed lamel, which allows force, or even win lamelu, so arm spáče zabořilo 'fine'.
For men who are 'shoulders across the whole of the back, "definitely important thing.
Even to remember even matrací manufacturers who, in 'pánských' start using změkčující zone in the area.
Women also remember - those dopřávají, softer surface kyčlí in places.
For the most demanding customers are křidélkové or destičkové rošty with so-called multitorzním pérováním.
Pressure was disintegrating into more points and reducing tensions.
But be careful when you on the right and the wrong matraci rošt cushion (great and 'naducaný "), most of the' plus' will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: The cushion has podepírat head and heads only intervene to ramenům to be able to mobilise ramenní muscles.
As the appropriate size of recommends 50 x 60 height, which show that, for example, in Scandinavia.
In camps on the side should cushion to cope (along with ramenní the cradle of roštu změkčenou or zone in matraci) adjust ramene.
Modern matrace with the original slamníky plněnými travinami, after all, something in common.
Their producers, are increasingly using natural materials or at least the ingredients.
The trend is also simply for matrací organic.
Raw materials from crude oil, which produce polyuretanové foam, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from skočce and soya.
Soybean is used by all manufacturers are known for.
'Organic for matrací means that the core of the material it is made from a purely natural origin, "explains Peter Vašíček from firms Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are used in the production of potahů matrací, one of the first was the aloe Vera report.
But you can also take you to mikrokapsle uvolňovala fresh smell of burnt or levandule.
There is also a division for men and women.
While men 'cooling' vegetable extrakt from břízy to potah matrace absorboval heat and cooler over potahy 'body, women, on the other hand, are'.
Extrakt from red papriček increases blood circulation, so the weaker sex tepleji.
Today's favorites?
Matrace made from Cold foam (has greater póry with porušenou brave structure is so prodyšnější than ordinary polyuretan and offers better elasticitu.
A combination of cold tuhostí pěn and 'lazy' foaming arise vícezónové matrace that know exactly where it is to be the head, shoulders and toes.
For the quality of the matraci you pay so from seven thousand kronor and levels.
Those that meet health parameters, they tend to have a lower rate of VAT, are taken as medical equipment.
First made in the Czech Republic on this advantage Gumotex.
Save on matraci and roštu is not easy.
Sometimes it can take advantage of the need for the actions of the producers or retailers who offer two matrace for the price of one.
Be a label Magniflex offers matraci Duofreeze the všitou paměťovou pěnou memory into potahu for 11 amendment 990 kronor.
The second but you can already get free.
The era of líných or viskoelastických pěn with an open structure of the brave and the high density of triggering 'space' pace Tempur material.
Originally created as a material for NASA, because in startech astronauts were exposed to enormous congestion.
Tempur keep themselves warm softening in chladnu zpevňuje on the contrary.
Teplému the human body is so perfectly adapt and dismantles his optimum pressure.
It is therefore the ideal against the emergence of proleženin, but also to increase comfort in their sleep.
The foaming Viskoelastické are used not only for matrace, but also on the medical products, to be on a special cushion under the feet that odlehčují nohám and žilnímu system.
Tuzemští pseudo-SMEs pěnu Eucatherm producers, for example, C or Twinsaver and the like.
Machines to monitor people want to ever more parents, they want their children so uhlídat
Fear for their own child still brings more people to the idea of policing via GPS.
The system initially ideal opportunity for search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, and help to be in such cases, such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Aničky Janatkové.
The device is not yet big around as a pack from sirek soon, but it can be great just like clockwork.
A number of people disappeared Aničky terrorized the case and began the quest for resources to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of their privacy.
"We are trying to say that this is not a spy, but another tool to reduce the likelihood that it will be a tragedy," says Peter wood from society Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment for the Czech market.
"I admit that, in some case, can lead to the abuse of such facilities, as when in bags of someone who knows about this, but we have not seen such a case".
"The majority of customers are buying this really for security reasons," he added of wood.
According to him, would always child should know to what purpose '' serves as a pack and used in the event of an emergency.
Child psycholožka Dan Bočková draws attention to the fact that if the child does not want to wear, nothing is simply discarded.
"Even very small children are showing great creativity in how some things set to lose if they do not want to be controlled."
The 'great expectations was previously with the parents, but phones can turn off as well as the monitoring equipment, "says Bočková.
According to her, and it is questionable whether, in the event of attack really such facilities help.
"When it comes to the forthcoming kidnapping will have a virtually always that my child should any electronics, which could reveal his location.
"Now it is the phone."
"When they begin to expand monitoring devices, will be looking for is because their sales will certainly be supported by a massive advertising."
"In this case, the criminals are always a step ahead of the police," says psycholožka.
He acknowledges, however, that such devices can help in the event of a sudden attack pedofilem.
According to Robert English from society RC monitoring, which offers monitoring services for cars and for the people, even in the event after the attack to immediately destroy the surveillance equipment, his presence can help.
"Devices can be set at regular send location after a certain period of time."
"If the damage will be available, at least, the location of the person concerned."
'More expensive devices are integrated and náklonometry, so even if a person only uklouzl and remained nehybně lie machine immediately send a warning with udáním location, "says Bohemia.
According to him, a similar service can do and smart mobile phones with navigací, where just nahrát and special software.
The problem of the current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either on the size of the machines similar přívěskům krabičky from sirek or smaller mobile phones.
Always in danger of losing.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil is therefore now test equipment vypadající as ordinary digital watches.
"This will have the greatest advantage that potential aggressor not monitoring equipment at all. '
"Or is it about only after some time, and this may give the police the extra time," he adds.
Whatever monitoring devices put into náramků or přívěsků, will continue to use the same technology, which is used to leave their vehicles.
It is a combination of identifying the location via GPS system (which use ordinary autonavigace) and functions of a mobile phone, which the current position of the vehicle.
The army has zápalných cord banks that obmotaly the Czech Republic, but only the last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometres cord banks that are firing explosives.
Already last year, the Department of Defense has come into the stores 224 miles cord banks.
The army has reserves of 225 years.
The problem is that life is two cord banks, a maximum of four years.
The army bought zápalné cord from stock STV Group, Inc. for the 40 million kronor.
The General Staff of the rationale for the purchase of such a huge amount of cord banks zápalných MF today's that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres zápalnic a year.
Calculations from the military, which has approached pyrotechniků MF today, however, is that it would be very intensive pyrotechnickým had to undergo training every year and all the generals, officers command of the army, secretaries or cleaners.
The defense minister and head of the army of Alexander Vondra Vlastimila Picka included.
Just as it would be to justify the annual consumption of army 60 kilometres zápalnic.
This is in line with the length of the 25,000 eruptions.
And even if this really was the army reserves would vystačily for more than ten years.
If, on the other hand, would apply that to basic training each new professional just at the most two metres zápalné cord, say experts, the army secured the purchase - even with the increased consumption of ženijních or special forces - stocks on the 225 years.
Soldiers of the rapid deployment of brigades, Minister Vondra recently personally complained that they have almost no ammunition into ručních weapons, so are the shootings because of the need for money.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"To me it is also the head of the rides that they buy from us repeatedly so many zápalnic. '
"But it is their decision, and I certainly know what they will be."
"For us, the army is a good customer, as traders trying to accommodate," says the commercial manager John Děcký STV Group.
A spokesman for the Department of Defense John Pejšek hundreds of kilometres nakupované cord and the fact that the army will have reserves of this' ammunition 'for at least ten years.
John Děcký of STV Group, however, talk only of a four-year life zápalnice and police or army pyrotechnici even just two years.
"In a perfect storage can also be those four," says one of them, who as a soldier because of criticism does not want to disclose the name of the army.
After a lifetime of any ammunition must be carefully tested, whether it is still reliable and is not a threat to the lives of soldiers.
These tests, however, are not free of charge, and it is worth more money.
Another argument is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometres zápalných cord banks.
"We were about 60 percent less than last year's supply of two hundred 44 miles, 'is conveying Pejšek nákupčích the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: Annual consumption of delivery vehicles police pyrotechniků cord banks who destroy munitions from the Second World War or after the Soviet army doesn't exceed its past few years 1500 metres.
And the police intend to always only the amount of the ammunition used up before the end of the cycle.
Worked with it for the sake of security pyrotechniků, and can obtain more modern, more flexible, and therefore more reliable types of cord banks.
The Ministry of Defence has already considerable difficulties with the removal of the tens of thousands of tonnes of munitions from the Warsaw Pact, which annihilated Czechoslovakia's army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech pyrotechniků according to that MF today appealed for a few years there will be the same problem: It will dispose of hundreds of miles of old zápalnic, which today 'cheap' purchases.
Still čerpám of the contacts that I am, thanks to the competition received
Winning a place in the competition of the year helped the sole trader Lukáši Pytlounovi franšízy in the sale of his hotel.
The winner last year of competition of the year, became a sole trader osmadvacetiletý entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberce.
His story is a success of the film.
Lukáš Pytloun I went.
And Abroad realized that Liberci lacking in quality accommodation for a reasonable price.

"This is far from being just my personal success, it is the result of good work by all of us together."
'My name is vystrčeno to the fore, "he now says modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
I wish my successor calmer year than we had in Farmetu
The euphoria of victory quickly gave way to the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to cílevědomosti Farmet worse, however, is the winner of the times in a row.
For the price for the first place in the competition last year Vodafone firm, last year in the house owner Slovanském reached firms Farmet, Karl Žďárský.
The jury then appreciate the efforts through which it built from a small nástrojářské workshops in the Czech Skalici company stamilionovými the most.
"I can tell you that the award has encouraged not only me, but all my collaborators and increased self-confidence us to struggle with competition," he says today, last year's winner.
At the beginning of the history of the firms Farmet was the desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered father Karl Žďárského to rent one small dílničku as compensation for the Communists seized from the property, not for a long time, has refused a career in the company, where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his táty a firm on plastic bathtub.
Shortly later, started to specialise in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years of them become the largest manufacturer of automatic lisů in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among the public and neodbornou the company received after the success in the competition through the media.
"Not only our customers have started to see the brand Farmet significantly better, but also foreign partners have begun to appreciate that work with the company, which has been in the greater the success of their country," says Karl Žďárský.
Last year, however, was in a marked by the euphoria of Farmetu vítězsví.
The award was based on the economic results of the firms in 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of strojírenského goods.
During the height of the crisis, which has so much nedotýkala citizens, but the company has already carried out stops its investment projects, and began to limit purchases of new machinery and technology.
"This situation is, of course, no, nor us. '
'Sales have fallen by 40%, we have had to cut back production and even on fire, "explains Charles Žďárský.
Viable company must be able to do that and sometimes unpopular measures.
But the situation and the company managed to keep profits, although less than before the crisis.
What, however, is in the Farmetu neslevili investment in research and development.
'From subsidies, we built a research and training centre, we have strengthened the presentation on international fairs, received the award in domestic exhibitions, "says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them, the number of new employees.
New winners' I wish a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere, "Karl vzkazuje Žďárský.
Anketa, pointless legislation that removes
Anketa on the absurdity of the year, is part of the race for the fourth time.
Some of the senseless rules have already been abolished.
Next year the winner Neslavným exit the absurdity of the year has become a duty to wear to the office of the documents that officials are also available online.
This was decided by more than a third of less than four thousand voters.
Social security administration, for example, require a paper land commercial register, although official it can gain two kliknutími mice.
Thanks to anketě this to change.
'Česká social security administration already land commercial register in checks to taxpayers will require insurance premiums, "said spokesman John ČSSZ Buraňová.
Shine a light on all the rules and regulations that must companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic to play, and the absurd to the point of the competition is the absurdity of the year.
This is the fourth time this year, has been part of the race by the economic newspapers and among the general public are becoming more popular.
If the vote took part in the last year, about three thousand voters, earlier this year, there were nearly four thousand.
And not surprisingly, the various statutory obligation, which only serves to delay the business, it is with us still.
"To be in the number of lejster for the taxes we are at the top of the world," notes Karl Havlíček of the Association to small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the business in recent years, becoming an avowed goal of all governments.
Compared with the rest of the world, but in the Czech Republic to improve the situation.
According to the World Bank, with the Czech Republic in terms of conditions for business ranks 74. position that is eight points worse off than last year.
The absurdity of the year competition was first declared in 2006 and takes place every year, according to the same script.
Přihlašovat administrative and bureaucratic nonsense can anyone every year from April to the end of September, when the closure date is competition.
Applying to serve the Web address www.firmaroku.cz Following host the competition to select the seven candidates' anticenu 'and leave it in the course of the October vote by the public via the Internet at sites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdity and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
In this year's exit was přihlášena more than 100 to 105 legislation and regulation lacking sense.
Sent off entrepreneurs, but also professional unions and journalists.
Between 'finalisty' competition between nominovanými so, for example, was a requirement that vehicles on the highway and speed roads pay tolls or to entrepreneurs with 20 employees, two offices and two toilets painted every two years.
The list of this year's sedmičky proposals is published on the websites of the competition.
The competition, which is always the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, which is part of the hapenningu regularly attend the personality of the political and social life.
This year, for example, at the culmination of this competition asistovala Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of small and medium-sized enterprises and businesses of the Czech Republic or Peter Kužel Economic Association, the president of the Czech Republic.
'Economic prosperity cannot function where the state all entrepreneurs wheel, so it is my aim to abolish every year, at least three dozen paragraphs, which now only unnecessarily complicated business, "he told Martin Kocourek trade and industry minister.
Efforts to scrap the pointless regulations nevyznívá in vain.
In 2007 the people most entrepreneurs vadila duty to report three days ahead živnostenskému office in the ground, where it is located permanent place, the intention to go to the booth for an exhibition or a journey.
This obligation was removed excluded živnostenského of the law.
The second most hlasovaná duty in 2007, which has been reporting for office work of its foreign employees of the way up to 30 days, removing the law on so-called green card.
And in time lucky.
Absurdity 2009 happened regulation fyzioterapeutům ordinaci have in a large mirror, ledničku and two land weight.
It was in this year of Decree Health Ministry to be toned down - ledničku saw.
A new category of the socially responsible companies
Assesses the environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
In news this year for the fifth year of competing economic newspaper is a category called responsible firm 2010.
The mission of this competition is the promotion of a sensible and fair business.
"We want this support to firms that take account of the impact their business has on the environment and encourage socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the company, the mobile phone operator Vodafone, which is vyhlašovatelem and guarantor of the competition, as well as in the case of competition on rebela year.
In this first year of this special podkategorie main competition Vodafone firm 2010, the firm, for which it is not success in business the only long-term goal.
The story of each and every one of them is a very inspiring and gave it to a separate article.
Although the subject of their activities one from the other, diametrically opposed the common denominator for their efforts to support and consideration.
In one case concerns, for example, people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or the health of its employees.
Among the 14 celorepublikovými finalisty finds itself, for example, the Prague software firm ET Netera, which supports the creation of the informal sports teams among the employees, who were then involved in a series of turnajů in different sports.
Another example of the responsible firms from Pardubického Isolit-Bravo districts, the company, which is the main backer of the seventeen years nadačního fund sponzorujícího disabled children.

At Pozemkovém Fund in Plzni police zatýkala in public competition
In building Pozemkového Fund in Plzni zatýkala anti-corruption police in the past few days.
Želízka detektivové muzzle local entrepreneurs in media sphere and dealer with real Luboši G.
He reportedly tried to manipulate the public competition to deal restitution claims, so that the plot of land in the competition offered by concrete.
He had for G. Luboši to pay half a million kronor.
"So far, I can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for the pletichy in a public tender and in public competition," said Secretary of State law plzeňského representations Antonie Green that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation, we cannot provide.
Šestačtyřicetiletého entrepreneurs police after 24 hours of release.
About how it could affect public competition, can be given a minimum of official information only speculate.
Spokeswoman Pozemkového fund Lubomíra black to the question of Law, said that in the workplace in odloučeném Plzni really zatýkali police officers, during a public competition.
'It was a client, not our employees' specify.
A public competition to name the challenge "of the right to make an offer for the transfer of land, according to the law of the land" and is being held in the case, which will be an interest in the plot of land on the proposed more legitimate asylum seekers.
'These people within the challenges offer higher value of their restitution claims, which are to be addressed by transfer than the value of the property was vyhlašovaná.'
"According to the claims of states offered order nabyvatelů and a land fund then převede plot of land for a person who has offered the highest claims," explained the spokesman for the fund.
Luboš G. probably should have information who have signed up to the challenges, and because he is also justified the person as skoupil series of restitution claims, offered his client a plot of land that the competition will not be there.
For this apparently inkasoval severance payments.
This would account for the fact that he was in detention as large a sum of money.
Luboš G. should have extra connections to the PF in Plzni in the past.
There was, in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing in spare land restitution, which has already been issued a decision on the location of the construction.
Just then gained Luboš G. from the fund, for example, of the land earmarked for the construction of public communications, particularly in a place where we should build příjezdová magistrála into industrial zones Borská field.
Later is very conveniently směnil with magistrátem for the house in the historic center of the city, which was the value of the much higher.
At the time that the city had to move, because, otherwise, by blocking the construction of the land.
Households on housing připlatí hundreds of monthly
Households will have to since January připlatit not only for all types of energy, but also for water charges and stočné, the supply of heat and somewhere to grow and nájmy.
The family will have to pull from January from the purses of up to hundreds of kronor per month, more than we do now.
Electricity becomes more expensive up to 4.6%, gas will be about 2 per cent more expensive, and about a tenth in some cities will have to připlatit for water supplies and mnohde also podraží the supply of central heating.
Electricity costs should households in homes come on stokoruny more than a year now.
The price of the electricity at the same time, all the major suppliers have reduced to blame, so it is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular fotovoltaiky.
While gas will push up slightly, however, at a time when most people are, and they have such high consumption.
Annually must also reckon with hundreds of kronor.
While electricity and gas will become more expensive for the Republic, a change in the prices of central heating is different place from the spot.
Price increases are mainly to the greater community.
For example, households in Pardubicích or Hradci kings pay since January as the central heating about 50 kronor per month in addition to the more than 1,000 kronor per year to pay for the family in Liberci.
The people of Prague, there is a risk that they will become more expensive, more than 9 per cent of water charges and stočné, and that, in the event that the city will increase the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rent will change, připlatí Pražené to 6.8 per cent.
Price in Prague, however, it will still be in celorepublikovém comparison between lower.
In the north, where the Czechs now prices are among the highest, has water charges and stočné podražit by 7.4 per cent.
Significantly, for example, may rise in the price of rent in 450 nájemních, where hundreds of thousands of homes from January to the end of regulation.
For example, the company CPI apartments, which at the mouth over Labem own about 2,500 flats from January, intends to rent increase of up to 100 per cent.
Those who do not agree with the new levels of leased, intends to give the company to court.
Regulated nájmy, which is approximately 300 people in hundreds of thousands of homes, the next year could rise by up to 10 per cent.
The Czech children opíjejí fernetem and rumem is going out of fashion. Pivo followed slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and whisky label, exceptionally better ukradená parents.
These are drinks, which ends after taking most often in the care of doctors opilci, which has not yet been or fifteen years.
The exception are children who are being treated in hospital from monkeys repeatedly.
This stems from the experiences of doctors who are faced with similar cases on the revenue department of children's hospitals.
"Any beer or wine are completely nemódní, because it takes a long time to fiches opijete. '
"The trend is certainly tough alcohol," he told the right primář Delinking Hořovice children's hospital in central Bohemia Luděk Pelikán.
'When they will be able to extract a bottle of tatínkovi from cupboards, so it is to be on the whisky, but is otherwise fernet and vodka'.
'Vodka has the advantage that it pour into the juice and not so many of them feel,' explained primář.
And in truth it also gives Fakultní Motol Eva Jurinová spokesman for the hospital.
"Most of all it is fernet or rum."
"This is today a modern alcohol, particularly in primary schools'.
"In some cases, that has brought on slivovici from home," said Jurinová.
According to primáře Pelikána are 13 or čtrnáctiletí pijáci at the hospital income relatively commonplace.
Before Hořovicemi, where acts from this year, has worked for 10 years on pediatric in Motole, where ambulances svážejí podroušené schoolchildren from broad surrounding area.
"One girl lay about four times for us. '
'Career began in 12 years when it brought to us with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in their blood, in combination with extází, "described a doctor is particularly serious case.
"Was výstavišti in Holešovicích for any dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother not at all strange that her daughter did not know about 48 hours," the very primář.
It is the parents or even their considerable tolerance towards popíjení own offspring is considered to be the main cause of the growing baby pijanství.
An addiction in the true sense of the word, but according to experts, for children to speak.
"Under the concept of an alcoholic means několikaletá chronic dependency on alcohol all phenomena, which restricted, and that of the children. '
'For those that alcohol use repeatedly, is rather symptomatic failed rodinně-sociální background, "explained primář Pelikán.
Jurinové this year, according to the spokesman of the pediatric clinic in Motole hospitalizovali by the middle of November, roughly 40 opilých children.
Included in the statistics, however, they will receive only those with severe intoxikací, who had to stay in hospital.
Child opilci following ambulantním treatment odvezou parents or is shipped home of the police, will not do.
In addition to the cases where children just down after school and they drink a bottle of kořalky, there are three seasonal fluctuations in Pelikána, on which you can count on: The witch hunts, Silvestr and the end of the school year.
"Either drink sorrow from the bad certificate, or, on the contrary, hailed the beginning of a holiday."
"Witch, I experienced on income and seven child opilců at the same time," said Pelikán.
Opilec detoxikací spent the night under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, is at an advantage compared to the fact that the second day at home vytrpí painful hangover.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, mostly inevitable zavodňovací with glukózou by nutrients and, in the absence of the organism.
"They are actually better off, as they have after this experience the beautiful evening and good awakening and nothing is more pain '.
"Not only are the confusion of where they are," acknowledged Pelikán with the fact that patients sometimes zkazí a pleasant mood, at least, a list of costs that their treatment cost.
Transportation sanitkou and hospitalization for an acute bed, it is also in the tens of thousand kronor.
"Sometimes I use it as an educational tool, when I am directly to those children then vizitě has been calculated how much their drunkenness, and that could also spend the entire summer on brigádě to earn the one party," added Pelikán.
Health insurance, however, it would, in which management regresním after parents enforce the cost of treatment, in cases of child opilců nepřistupují.
Two aircraft L-159 are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two aircraft L-159 out of a total of five pieces for which the Czech Ministry of Defense vyměnilo Casa C-295M transport plane, Tuesday odletěly in the Spanish Sevilly where aircraft manufacturer - EADS Casa.
This is the first time that this type of machines were owned by someone other than the Czech army.
Abroad has only been on the exercises or předváděcích years.
It is about dvoumístné L-159T1 version, which still ran the Czech army and which were letuschopné.
The remaining three machines are jednomístné L-159.
Yet it is in those zakonzervované Aeru Vodochody and broker trade - firm Omnipol - is already taken over the last week.
When aircraft from Vodochod physically some, it is, according to John Pejška Press from the Department of Defense has not yet known.
'Jednomístné aircraft L-159 have been earmarked for conversion of the aircraft, and that in the long term imposed without further deposits and investments from the home ministry.
'Dvoumístné L-159T1 be converted in the current shape and form, "said law Pejšek.
He added that the military planes left without dvoumístných because the department in May 2009 with Aerem Vodochody signed a contract in the $200 million kronor on the rebuilding of the four unnecessary machines L-159 on two dvoumístné machines.
One new plane was taken over by the army in July, the second will take until the end of this year.
According to the EADS Pejška pledged that aircraft weaponry to enforce some NATO countries.
"It is clearly stated in the Treaty that buyer of aircraft L-159 is company EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries'.
"It is therefore things odběratele how this thing is going to be implemented," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper recently reported that, for example, the Spanish army on L-159 has no interest in.
The exchange of five L-159 for one plane Casa and the purchase of three other planes for 3.5 billion kronor last year, the government approved Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence to buy nevypsalo tender and addressing directly EADS.
The leadership of the defence argument went by směnou support future exports L-159 abroad.
The Czech army from Aera bought 72 machines and uses only 24, the rest would sell.
Casa the purchase of aircraft is likely to be and the aftermath.
The European Commission, the Czech ministry of defence moved against the European Court, therefore, that the aircraft had to choose on the basis of a pan-European tendru oslovením and not one of the producers.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa last should at the Prague airport Kbely land in a fortnight.
Longer ukazováček than prsteníček marks a lower risk of cancer
The men, who are ukazováček longer than prsteníček are exposed to less risk that diagnosed with prostate cancer.
That is the startling conclusion of the study, which was published Wednesday in the British journal of cancer.
This may relate to the levels of the male hormone testosteronu.
"Our results show that the relative finger length can serve as a test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men in 60 years," said study co-author Ros Eelesová, a professor at the Institute for Research on Cancer in Warwicku University.
Finger and could help identify men who should take the test for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk of threats or other factors such as family health burden, add Eelesová.
In a period of 1994-2009 monitor with colleagues in Britain, more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and in parallel over three thousands of healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had ukazováček on the right hand shorter than prsteníček.
Pay for them, the same as the probability of prostate cancer for 19 per cent of those whose fingers are just as long.
In the case of those who should ukazováček longer than prsteníček, however, this risk has fallen by 33 per cent for men to šedesátky 87 per cent of the decline was even.
The ratio of the length of two of these fingerprints - utvářených in the prenatal period - probably reflects the different levels of sex hormones, which the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosteronu corresponds to the prolonged ukazováčku.
Previous research has shown that it supports the growing testosteron prostate cancer.
Leading Czech genetik and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that this study briefly knows him, but it does not appear that the relationship between the length of fingerprints and cancer was "quite clear".

It is, therefore, can be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, behind a wall or in zákopu.
From the top, is usually protected, and when he withstand the murderous rain steel střepin, it has to remove it from the fight.
According to Richard Audetta, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, is the first new gun loaded weapons for the infantry, which uses the 'smart' technology.
"Soldier with it basically goes so that a goal to send him laserový ray, which will determine the distance and gets upřesněný deliberate point, according to him, regulates náměr and it will squeeze a tap."
"Let us say that you naměřili 543 meters."
'When stisknete havoc with nabije weapon and exploding a missile on the distance of the 543 metres of plus or minus one, two or three metres, "Audette said.

Online activists used for the disclosure of secret diplomatic cables Amazon Web Service (AWS), in order to cope with the high number of approaches to the documents.
Through service Twitter Wikileaks to explain this step: 'Fine - now we spend our dollars by zaměstnáme people in Europe. "
When Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, 'then they should stop selling books ".

The chairman of the Senate committee for the defense of the home threatened boycott of the Amazon, to inform the British 'Guardian'.
"I would have wished that Amazon has started to do this before, given earlier by publishing classified information to WikiLeaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for, as well as in other countries to prevent the platform in the use of the sites.

Zmrzlinová University
On 'Gelato University' in Boloně preparing zmrzlinoví cukráři to better seasons.
The basic course for future zmrzlináře that has been going on for three days, it is a lot of interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
Where, in fact, it takes zmrzlina?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, Czech a bit archaic zmrzlinář, produces krém all of the rules, according to the Italian zmrzlinářského art.
Gelataio vyndá stěrkou ice cream from chladícího setře boxing, her into the cake being served and sold.
You see this, you do not have to go to 'Anzola the Emilio in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to learn more about zmrzlině, he escapes the 'Gelato-University' Italian firms Carpigiani.
In 2003 it established producers zmrzlinových machines zmrzlinovou university to zmrzlina of his machinery fit everywhere a high Italian ideals.
The basic course for future Gelatieri that has been going on for three days, it is a huge interest and visitors coming from all over the world.
But několikadenní also offers special rates on chocolate zmrzlině and praktika in their own zmrzlinárně.
Some aspire to in their Midlife-Crisis for a new career, others dare to on the thin ice of their vague aspirations.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries all continents - from Brazil via Hungary after Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a teacher from California, loves art movement Slow-Food and I would in future offer high-quality European product industrial Ice-Cream in the country.
Anke from Berlin is corporate konzultantka and I would, after years of being stressful work to start something of their own.
Two young cause of an Egyptian woman dreaming that in Kairu zmrzlinárnu open.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian woman in households Julia arrived, because her children love the Italian ice cream.
Luciano Maestro-Gelatiere Ferrari first participants explain the ideal perfect properties of ice cream.
The key is not only good taste, but also hedvábná hebkost and good consistency.
Luciano forget during his training at jižanskou and patriotic final icing on the cake: 'Italian Gelato is it simply the best - and that includes even a good dose of romantiky.'
The first step in the production seems to be pretty simple.
Luciano will leave the basic ingredients milk šlehačku prášek, dairy, sugar and stabilisers into the great mixéru that everything warm between electronic programme to 85 degrees and then immediately cool to four degrees.
Then turning on the tap machines and vyteče pasterizovaný basic krém white, the basis of all types of milk zmrzlin.
Immediately zasypán issues is a senior lecturer: It is possible to produce only eat from natural substances without stabilizer?
How can one experiment yourself?
Luciano warns, to be carried away by the spirit of the time in the dark.
Those who talk about the 'zmrzlině only from natural ingredients, "probably just used the stabilisers - the majority of the natural product, as it is the wheat used guarová from guarových zrnek.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must sell in one day, otherwise we will bring the same ice and the customer her grain.
Some variation of the basic fuel are leave.
Napínavější it will be with the flavouring esencemi.
Maestro Luciano distinction with the taste of ice cream in the ingredients, which are buying in a supermarket in either the department with fruit or sweets in the separation.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers you will try to impose a lot of aromatised ingredients'.
"But you should simply experiment."
Either with dessert sorbety with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or zmrzlinou of white matter, which is a fundamental change to the Yellow vajíčky krém and kakaem on the basis for všelijaká čokoládová the temptation.
Now, of course, to zmrzlinovým get involved.
Luciano is he always produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, kávové lískooříškové of ice cream and egg - either with or without them in basic hmotě, with more or less vanilkovým properties or other natural přísadami.
There will be the same experiment with dessert types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances more fruit pyré - given the taste of this is not always better.
Lískooříšková zmrzlina chutnat oříšková not more, when more lískových contains nuts.
Favorite ice cream from the kiwi fruit produced group, which uses the more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only when balanced mixture of highlighting the right taste Gelato, says Luciano.
Production of ice cream is a purely numerical task: If using peaches pyré with a lot of sugar, it must be to reduce the share of sugar in the basic recipe.
For there is a need for a portion of ice cream for extra sugar.
Luciano vyndá machine, which determines the sugar in fruit (vine-growers the measure must of grapes).
Fortunately, the tables been developed to help the numbers.
Production of ice cream already does not require physical effort so much as before.
Not only for the automatic machine production of basic fuel.
There is also the device, which is a mixture of zmrzlinovou umíchá krému and, at the same time to cool down the temperature at minus.
Despite all the automatizaci Evasions small accidents.
Brazilan Gustavo zašpiní himself and his colleagues from the top down to ovocným pyré, when he gets out of control, a huge mixér.
"At any rate, considers' Maestro Luciano, 'it is only a matter of time before something like this happens.'
In the light of the dual revizoři
The European Food EFSA is linked with the industry, which has experimented with genetic plants.
This accusation has now voiced Testbiotech group of experts, which considers itself the independent Institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds contrived theory, but we are well documented," he said Wednesday in Munich boss Testbiotechu Christoph Then.
The leader of a group of experts EFSA for gentechnicky transformed plants, Harry Kuiper, and other expert EFSA have several years of the contract, the union lobistů Ilsi.
It is funded by the concerns as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper participated in a decisive way to control legislation EFSA for genetic plants and is in clear conflict of interest, criticises Then.
EFSA said the rules are the same in whole paragraphs, with documents Ilsi and a script so industry, which should be controlled by Parma in Italy.
It is the second time that Testbiotech draws attention to a conflict of interest.
Recently entered high manažerka from the EFSA without EUROPASS or transitional period the Swiss agrárnímu reassessment by Syngenta - and the party has changed.
Also radio for Central Germany (MDR) revealed recently personnel links EU-úřadu for control with the industrial lobby, which has aroused the interest of both the Department for the Environment, as well as members of the EU.
In the meantime, the EFSA cannot identify a conflict of interest.
It works with all the serious data, as well as those of the industry, as long as they are highly professional quality, it says in a statement.
From the experts who work for the EFSA, are not required to have contacts with the industry.
But it must be demonstrated.
Kuiper admits his work for International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to estimate the risk of biotechnology without the Treaty lobbyists.
Independent experts as Then criticise that are currently leave gentechnicky transformed plants without any attempt in the animal feed, and the response of plants to netestuje of genetic effects of the environment.
"We want to know what to do, for example, changed gentechnicky corn on the field," said Then.
Current practice is only testing isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant is expelled, which nedoloží reliable results.
"If we are not looking for the risks, how could it be, then, is to find a possible? 'Asks žalobně Then.
He agrees and Angelika Hilbeck.
Scientific worker examines gentechniku since 1994 and is currently working on the technical high school in Zurich.
In this area, to the industry, as well as in the US, now also in Europe, more and more influence or discredit critical scientists.
This is why almost there are scientists who would not be associated with the concerns.
Mostly nepublikují studies, which are critical for the company.
"Industry controls the security research," considers Hilbeck.
Footprint of the cornerstones of
Uli Gsell also some acquired a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening, before nádražím in Stuttgartu, tubu on the back.
The demonstrations.
Sněžilo.
It is known the story: In September, busloads of bagry and began tearing down a great deal of northern wing.
Stuttgartu in the world has been the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, miliardovému reduction in the station.
When a halt to the construction of most of the wing, lay in ruins.
Rozbité, 6,000 to 7,000 pieces.
Vápenec from Crailsheimu, soft rough stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years.
Secured several of these pieces.
'These stones are relikvie.'
Not 'disappear'.
Fades: 'Cheap and poor, simple stone and primordial.'
When one rozřízl, smrděl after cigarette smoke.
What with those pieces will do not know it.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Footprint blocks from Stuttgartu leads to forest in Tübingen on the former deponii munitions the French army, where Manuel Rongen built its empire straight.
44-letý man traded with the old stones.
It bought all incurred during the collapse in Stuttgartu.
"That would be a shame if, rozemlely on štěrk or disappeared on deponii ', says in her office, wooden booth, which was previously a house.
That tells him nadávali and had treated him when, in September in all the newspapers said that it bought the remnants of a northern wing from the society, which is carrying out the demolition of.
But he spoke of the whole days with adversaries S-21.
And explain to them that for the demolition of all, after all, cannot.
And when that happens, then it is reasonable, when stones continue to use it.
Then we took around 200 S-21-protivníků each one about 80 kilograms heavy bloc, the price for a piece of 6,50 up to 14 of the euro.
As memory, some also in the hope that it will come back in the building.
Rongen bought 500 tonnes of cargo, 25 large trucks.
About half of it is still in the forest, the rest have long sold.
Gardeners krajinní zahradníci, those houses.
They have come from all corners and odtáhli what kufru přívěs and to fit in.
Stones from Stuttgartu dispute had to be transformed into 'zídky' or as a fringe záhonů with bylinkami.
"This stone is actually nothing special, 'says Rongen.
"If it was not the political vsuvky. '
Nasedá in its field cars and travelled to projížďku after his 20-ti hektarovém UK.
Studied law, first off, the study of biology, then later took on the computer, and eventually became a trader with stones.
And milovníkem blocks.
My reposited 40000 tonnes of blocks.
Tie their treasures from all over Germany.
It says that is the largest trader of old stones in the Republic.
.
In the snow lies umělecky opracované pískovce.
'Once belonged to Marien-most in Dresden' Testament.
Pískovec of Labe, Yellow, is a warm, enthusiastic.
'My favourite stone'.
We are going to continue after the track up through the forest.
Shows: The Red pískovec a bundle, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
Travertin 'fine'.
Once they were on the forum for many kvádry Neckarstadionu in Stuttgartu.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories Cannstatt-travertin of the police by the Presidium in Stuttgartu, Red granit of the St. Blasien, tuf from hospitals in Heilbronnu.
What work, what hardship that sweat.
When Rongen think about how the bureau before rozbíjely stones and be carried through simple kladkostrojů and teams povozů, it will be very respectful.
"It would be a scandal if this drtilo. '
Not the rich, very rich have not at all.
Trader with stones but today employs 14 people, and in addition, the seated kameníci up in the forest, a sculptor, one kovář, one sklář and one zahradník.
"We are working hard, but it is satisfying, 'says one who has appreciated the rump.
In the foreseeable future, to Cologne.
There also will be to rescue the stones.
The battle of talent on High-potenciály
The food is a lot of people.
16 students are pushing for chlebíčků with lososem, rajčatové soup and sweets.
Technical university in Braunschweigu and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students of engineering and design at the workshop.
Together with developers firms VW here have to talk about the car of the future - and the only way to get to know the way, Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to race in the cleverest brains, as well as a firm VW to succeed and betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: What possible recruit in posluchárnách the best graduates, even before they get to the labour market and will continue to be concerned about this.
Since universities are not issued any lists of the success of its students, are trying to reinvent the company's exceptional talent in projects nationalistic-minded to practice and to get it.
The Braunschweig trying to motor concern to acquire the talent on the second day.
One young lady from personal department gives propisky, rubber medvídky and plates with the VW logo.
Tells a promising young talents of programmes on praktika, student employment and suggests ways to reassessment by them.
Nico Selle of Braunschweig here cares about the project, together with VW.
See the benefits for both sides: "Students will come into contact with the industry and gain experience. '
'VW can at the same time, closer to the students to learn about the candidates and interesting minds who could be described as an associate of'.
Such cooperation, according to Selle, are not unusual.
But the news is that it is so openly struggling students.
"Otherwise, it was rather significant technical project, 'says Selle.
The battle for fresh graduates may be even tougher.
In many industries, the firms cannot choose their employees from long the crowd of candidates.
On the contrary, they must try to try and entice particularly highly skilled workforce.
Graduates engineering disciplines have excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the Association of German engineers VDI remained in October will remain unfilled 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI engineers still grow.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG is Roman Dykta hunting talent.
By demanding Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, the type of modern race for treasure, in which participants must find a way to GPS koordinát.
Next year, the company is planning to send such eight promising students after the US.
Participants can see through the branches at the same time, KPMG and to familiarise themselves with the firm.
In advance of the decision in the two rounds of competition, who will take part in.
Only Crème de la Crème from the number of people flying to the US.
In the competition for high Potentials at universities will pay Dykty according to increasingly tough laws.
"We want to be with our race to distinguish itself from other '.
"A simple trip to a sailor was, for us, the power of the few '.
It seems that lovec talent Dykta has been lucky.
"We have remained in contact with all of the participants in the similar actions in the past year. '
"Some will soon be coming to an end and we are now planning to apply for a job," he says.
In addition to direct reach on Campus, particularly small and medium-sized firms has camouflaged on labour markets.
"We are trying to make contact with graduates at specialist exhibitions."
'Such as the Intersolar' claims Sitha Stübe personnel department, the leading manufacturer of solar technology Solarworld.
From Bonn in Germany, the company employs around 1,500 workers.
Stübe knows the issue with young workers.
It is currently called 35 positions on the company's website.
"At the present time it is difficult to fill vacant jobs. '
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
Another option is to contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld is cooperating with the various high schools, such as the university in Freibergu.
'Professors are reporting that it is possible for us to do praktika or write diplomovou work'.
Solar Specialist does no expensive advertising Service.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other advantages: Personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
The 'great concerns that often cannot offer, "says a leading personal Delinking Stübe.
In search of work for a long time does not play a major role in the money.
Flexible working hours, looked after children or good possibility of procedure are other factors at play.
Solarworld occupied in one study that Work Institute Great Place 55. place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute is putting together an annual list of the best of the German employers.
In addition, the aides questioning how they are satisfied with their work and work environment and watching the framework conditions of employees.
Leading personal Delinking Stübe hopes that it will give the location of the points with bids for the work.
"I think that people are informed, especially on external assessments of the potential employers," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a long-term strategy a good reputation as an employer.
Advising its customers to be more autentičtí.
And, according to Mr Krieglera this means, above all, an internal measures.
"The best way to go, as visible as an attractive employer runs through its own employees," he says.
Technically it is called Home Employer Branding, thus promoting employers on the market within their own employees.
'Happy employees are the best ambassadors. "
When a company well cares about its people and they identify with the company, will themselves do advertising their employers between friends and contacts.
"This is a game with provázkem," said Kriegler.
Obama brings new oil drilling
During the next few years there will be a coastal US-spolkového the state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, the new oil drilling.
The government in Washington issued a ban - and thereby abolishing definitively earlier plans.
Also from the Atlantic coast, there are new drilling prohibited.
The Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, it said on Wednesday.
The reason for a strict ban, which would have to pay at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon vrtné the tower '' in April.
Before the accident, which cost the lives of 11 workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama signaled to pressure the opposition, and the industry is its willingness to new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Supporters have been trying to reduce the US dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clearly explained, who bears responsibility for a devastating olejovou disaster in the Gulf.
At the heart of the criticism is British energetic concern BP, which faced miliardovými requests.
Commission of inquiry, which has appointed Obama, should present the results in December.
In October, the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar deep drilling ban, which has been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently have offered various oil concerns applications for new vrtné intentions.
Obama and Salazar they want to avoid a similar disaster stricter controls and strict safety regulations.
At the moment, fundamentally reforming control office to the attention of the many corruption charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that he will waive the lucrative possibilities of tax evasion for oil and gas concerns.
The industry now openly warned that tighter regulation will fundamentally těžené the volume of oil in the Gulf.
"The government's plans are the biggest impediment to the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent survey of the industry consulting firm BDO - even before deep drilling ban on Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance has yet to complain of uncertainty in the field: 'No one knows exactly what is going to change the regulations'.
Investment in new mining projects until the appeals are moving - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni burnt
Water in rivers is olejově brown, it stinks like the pump: Uniklé billion litres of oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni in Nigeria.
People eat kradením, corruption and illegal cooking oil.
Celestine Akpobari it means well.
'Netrapte', reassuring journalist green activist: 'Today, you will receive a objektiv still enough oil water.'
37-letý Nigeriánec attempt followed the boy, who has photographed brodí after prsa water flanked by šmouhy: The scene in the water luster with duhovými colors almost up nicely.
That, beneath the surface, swimming brown vascular of oil, it is not to be seen.
Earlier here in containers with enough garnel Testament, Esther Badom Bodo-Jetty on the side of the river.
In the meantime, become slowly flowing water completely dead.
Five years ago, spilled into the huge vlahé area from broken the leadership of large quantities of oil.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must row at least six hours to get to the water, where the fish are: The Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger Delta is one of the most contaminated areas in the world.
Following the path of the River mangrovníkovými bažinami with a lot of the alleys přítoků is only detectable a whole range of spouště.
The engine of the boat brewed instead of light water hnědou mess and who sinks his hand into the water, it pulls olejové fingers.
Roots mangrovníků tower from countries such as the black tyčky lékořice, rarely occurring plant palm trees are letting their papers were mentioned.
We are looking for a flock of birds in vain, which is normally in the wet areas are: Once on the boat, engine utichne rozhostí in earlier havens where it stinks like the pump, scare silence.
"What is happening here is the environmental leadership of the war," he says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health. '
Compared with the war is justified.
The area of the Ogoni is a battlefield, where a decade of fighting, more than 60 years ago, the first dobyvatelé nahrnuli here from Europe, here in the 1980's with utvářel the first resistance from executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa later, we had to concern Shell in 1993 to stop their production, because it was on the staff of the power of the dangerous.
It is still in the Ogoni firm must return: While the daily benefit from the whole area of the delta about triple the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometres of the leadership of the more than two million barrels of the black gold, lies the oil fields in the area of the Ogoni fallow for concern is that the power of the unstable situation.
Every few hundred metres from the water tower steel design as bizarre statues: 'Are called Christmas trees', so it is up to the power of the head of the drilling otvorů něžně call.
They are 50 years old, the majority until his zrezivělá.
Every moment that beat vrtného otvoru head, tells Akpobari, and then pour constant flow of oil into the water.
According to estimates by experts, vyteklo into the ecosystem in the more than two billion litres for 50 years: Every year in the amount of oil, what vyteklo into the sea in Alaska in the accident supertankeru 'Exxon Valdez' 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
There have been disputes, who is responsible for the remains of an environmental disaster.
While concern Shell is organized theft and sabotage of oil for more than 90% of the pollution, environmental ochranáři on the minds of bursting drilling and netěsných vedeních as the main cause.
Shell in Nigeria requires a much smaller safety regulations in the world than is customary, nařkl concern in 2008 US-americký scientist Richard Steiner: Only the amount of disorder at vedeních is supposedly 'many times higher than elsewhere. "
On the ground, which from a distance looks like abandoned, oil zašpiněná Workshop open-air will emerge from mangrovníků characters: They are completely naked and after the neck from oil.
Under one of the many casks, which are part of the leadership, partly at random scattered after the country is on fire, fire: Illegal small refineries.
Oil is in a barrel fire is heating up over a few hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
Vyteče ahead of leadership in záchytného pot gasolene kape later, at the end of the leadership of the kerosene and diesel at the end of the day.
In this way is Michael and his four associates on a daily basis to four sudy after 300 litrech: 'We earn so 34.000 Naira' - around 22 dollars.
The people of the delta are chronic shortages of fuel in the oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria own only one rafinerii.
Ridiculously low cost 40 euro cents per litre for diesel can still trump illegal producers: Because they are the raw material for free.
From 'bunkerů' who link to the leadership in the area of the Ogoni everywhere: According to the experts in the area of the Niger River delta is losing the country on a daily basis, at least 16 million gallons of oil.
But only a small portion of the negligible provisionally skladované raw materials are illegally zušlechtí: With the largest share of the organised criminal network, to whom they belong, as well as politicians and senior officials in the army, and sell it to the world market.
In the debate, whether the people who caused the disaster and their intervention or lax way of production, considers activist Akpobari for purely academic.
"If they had any oil company for an alien and if so perfectly not destroyed the essence of the fishermen then would not even sabotage or theft and illegal refineries'.
In the meantime, but it is, above all, the relationship between the Ogoni to Shell so damaged that it only in passing: 'Perhaps show reassessment by other nations, such as the Chinese as better'.
Michael unsettles.
"High time to have disappeared, 'says svalnatý producers.
"Every moment can come to the soldiers."
If it is a special military unit, so there is no danger of them while in prison, but the painful bribe.
Also soldiers, who mostly comes from the north of the country - like all Nigeriánci - they want to profit from the raw materials.
'Tadle prokletá thing got our country in all respects to the bottom, "says Akpobari.

Thousands are grieving for the dead miners
More than 10,000 people uctilo memory zasypaných miners in New Zealand, who were just a few of the dead after the bomb blasts in the coalmine.
Still failed to release the dead, because in šachtě is the security situation remains complicated.
Nearly two weeks ago in the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth to a strong explosion.
29 miners in age from 17 to 62 years, was overwhelmed by the mine.
In šachty, where there has been a disaster, was triggered by legislative probe, but after no trace of life.
Because of high concentrations of toxic gases, and the blast could go down because of the security forces of the rescue.
After strong detonaci started authorities and experts from the fact that miners already have no chance of survival.
Still failed to release the dead.
Now in memory of the dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand ten of thousands of people have gathered for slunečného weather.
Silent for two minutes.
The remembrance zasypaných 29 miners have been taken to the tables of them helmy; and the names of the miners.

The suits horor to artistic kinu?
Režisér Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to overcome the old boundaries again with a eposem 'Walhalla Rising. "
On what the audience thought about the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn, when točil 'Walhalla Rising'?
Captive vikingský fighter with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free from their mučitelů and on a large scale kills almost with supernatural force their opponents - it sounds ideally for young male viewers, who are looking for the bloody action, because our hero helps cruel methods and killing their enemies rve even vnitřnosti from the abdomen alive when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Jednooký, as it is called, in fact, during the whole of the film says not a word, and the other characters pronesou most one or two sentences or will be down to the painful dying cries.
Otherwise silent and hýří hrůzně hill in the beautiful countryside of Scotland, which offers kulisu world Vikingů about a thousand years ago.
The film is more an ideal for adults enthusiast cinemas interested in existencializmus and very quiet images of the camera.
It is good when the film more target groups, it is just a pity when mutually exclusive.
Režisér Winding Refn, after natočil their wild and stylizovanou trilogii on drug dealerech 'Pusher', is regarded as the Danish version of the filmmaker Quentina Tarantina stoicky, but preventing their closer to more mainstream of either humor or less brutality artistic the audience.
The majority of the supporters of the artistic cinemas will probably deter everywhere stříkajícím brain and vnitřnostmi.
Fans of action films with unudí, at the latest, when Jednooký issue of loosely vysvětlitelných reasons, a group of Christian missionaries backwards ships in Jerusalem and still leaves an eternity in bezvětří and fog than probably dopluje team in America and keep quiet.
So what is it any wonder that in Germany 'Walhalla Rising' get into cinemas, and has now been issued only on DVD.
This is a pity, mainly due to a magnificent záběrům, but also because, for the distinctive facade, at times too zborcenou blood is still burying exciting cinema that there could be a bit of attention.
In this movie is not about the dialogues or precise, everything is atmosphere horečnatý dream, which became the movie.
And this is for the onlooker run.
Refn nedopřeje him or moment to release him and slowly strangling their mrazivými images and gloomy hypnotickým soundtrackem nepopsatelnou, but above all, the hatred that prýští from the hearts of characters.
Only small blonďatý boy, which helps Jednookému, leaving something as innocence, all the rest are poháněni anger.
Of all the most jednooký hero, whose motives are never nevysvětlí, which will become a time of transition for the enemies and allies válečníkem from hell, perhaps envoy of the devil.
It plays destruction, but perhaps only for those rotten.
'Walhalla Rising' is a shadowy the film that it is possible to hate and admire, for the angry, excitement and admiration.
Experience.
The mysterious natural labour
The office of nuclear energy, the IAEA has new warnings on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the expression of the country - and even to control.
Around midnight of 5 to 6 September 2007 similar ideas at least four Israeli combat aircraft and F-15 čtvercovou over by the building in Syria.
It is on the shores of the Euphratu; the nearest city is more distant 30 miles and called Dair as-Saur.
Documents in the office of the International Atomic Energy (IAEA) is its name when it comes to the reactor, which Syria has reportedly with the aid of North Korea, in this čtverci schovaném in the valley, which odbočuje from the mainstream.
On the basis of voting US-americké foreign intelligence service the CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearest village el-Kibar well, threw for the production of plutonium - from which it is possible to build nuclear weapons.
Technology from the 1950s on anything inappropriate.
The CIA presented video with nezaostřenými satellite images.
Using computer animace clarify where components that before the destruction of the reactor could be, has to be a copy of the North Korean model zmenšenou Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, they were still the photograph that showed the building closely or even from the inside.
The reactor, just before it was launched, but even without the fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, knows much more than this, even with the puzzle of time yet.
Earlier US-prezident George W. Bush recently in his memoirs published that the CIA attack was a lot of sure that Syria is building in el-Kibar reactor, but in essence, not the details of that in the country is' an active nuclear weapons program. "
Some of the secret services in Europe are even more cautious and talk only about the alleged reactor "', even if the presentation of the CIA considered' echo of '.
They lack clear evidence, as well as the IAEA.
At issue, as it is one that has a reactor, said in the summer, a senior UN diplomat, the IAEA has said that 'enough material to put the issue ".
Suť allegedly 'unused military building "was quickly Syřany while odklizená and also properly zarovnali terrain.
Yet managed to find in June 2008 the team under the leadership of the former IAEA chief inspector Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar traces of uranium, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received the Member State via satellite photographs of commercial retailers from the time just after the attack, which should be more apt than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these images are on the market because it is exclusively friendly customer bought the unknown - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that he never had a secret nuclear weapons program and avoid the reactor.
Uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, to Damascus.
But that has been disproved by the IAEA from the analysis of the particles.
Since Damascus is refusing to discuss the matter, as well as satellite záběrech.
In addition, the banned revizorům the second inspection in el-Kibar and access to troskám rozbombardované buildings.
But Israel remains utterly silent.
"We never comment on ', confirmed recently official position at the time, the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case it is the shop since June 2008 and 'growing into a serious problem, given the credibility of the office, "he admitted as a Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - this is, after all, a serious violation of the treaty banning nuclear weapons, which is supervised by the IAEA.
The IAEA is considered the key to move forward on the other three facilities, which are supposed to be "operational" in connection with the alleged reactor - and unlike yet exist.
Revizoři yet so far, neither did not cite which facilities are, or how they function or why they are suspicious.
According to the newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally as Marj as-Sultan, the Masyaf and Iskandariayah derived, again according to those cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found on satellite pictures complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
Perhaps they are within or in the immediate proximity of military bases - this is exactly why Syria rejects the IAEA access to these three points.
In Vienna, said that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that would be sent to the IAEA in advance of the US to vypátral military bases.
Jaderní detektivové were alerted to the facilities of the US secret service.
The IAEA has also ground and satellite images that between these three places and čtvercem for Euphratu transportoval material here and there.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna, said that at least one furnished should be 'in connection with the production of fuel'.
But there is "no evidence of senzibilních activities," about the enrichment of uranium and the new processing; the processes that are vital for the production of nuclear weapons.
While it is driven by the type of reactor that is enriched uranium.
But where the uranium comes from and where it later be split on the plutonium bomb on these central questions there are only likely to estimates.
Also, it is not known whether the wreckage of which could hide important clues, are shelved in these three places.
As it disappeared from the surface of the earth hundreds of the cost of the trucks, no one does not seem to be able to know where the rubble.
Only a few kilometres from el-Kibar distant and, on the other hand, Euphratu lying 1930 salt mine al-Tibni, which left Syria to check in 1998 as a suitable storage of radioactive waste, considers the IAEA as unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley gave him in connection with a reactor in one analysis of satellite images of the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But images from space have shown that, after the IAEA demanded access, carried out by Syria on all suspects places natural work and removed large containers.
It could be a coincidence, but it would not help to clarify the suspicion.
In addition, talk about the diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent many months for revizory the creation of the plan, which would allow Syria to preserve any possible military secrets - only the hardship it shows how great it is in the interest of revizorů.
Damascus, meanwhile, rejected the proposal.
If even before uklidňovali Western diplomats in Vienna, that is, after all, the destruction of the reactor, and that is why this thing nehoří, have been talking about a couple of months the US Ambassador Glyn Davies on the so-called special inspections, which is one of the harsher funds, which has the authority to enforce the vídeňský nuclear inspections.
Yukiya Amano, the head of the IAEA that would suggest the inspections may have already talked about 'the possibility that in the future, but has yet to agree a' Hesitate.
This election is a big risk: On the one hand, it is a needed majority in the Council and the IAEA guvernérské many of the 35 countries has certainly interest in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: 'What would happen if, in the end, nothing will? "
Love in a time of war
Since Angelina Jolie began in the summer to work on still anonymous overheads prvotině, there have been problems.
She wrote the script, this is a love story of women and men from Bosnia from Serbia.
Many more have not yet know - but even that is causing unrest.
Constantly talk about the fact that this is a woman who is muslimka, falls during the war in the former Yugoslavia to the Serbian man who rape her.
Female Croat- alliances immediately protested, so hastily moved the planned recording from Sarajevo in Hungary.
The film, meanwhile, is in Hungary dotočil postprodukci and it is in, but still Bosensku objects.
Bakira Hasecic of the female war victims wrote via UN-organizace to help refugees from the UNHCR Jolie and asked for a meeting with herečkou, inform now Croat- newspapers - Jolie is also velvyslankyní UN-organizace to help the refugees.
It is not just diplomatic - offered to women already weeks before the meeting in Hungary, but refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In kempech where znásilňovalo, 's stories have been held there, and the attitude to the victims of the Jolie revealing enough about the scenario.
Her organization is recommended UN-organizaci to help refugees to Jolie release as Ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly she wrote scenes of Jolie?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture had to read the script, allows for smaller tug-of-war in Sarajevo - recording is not entirely clear why then Jolie yet nepřijela.
The author points out that in his film is not looking at any political intentions, with a great deal of effort to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, that it wants to show the terrible consequences of the war, and all the parties involved to make room.
Given the content remains vague.
On the Internet, there is one version of the film, which is really quite different: Boyfriends are already knew before the start of the war and, once again, both when she is as Bosnia's muslimka zavlečená to Serbian kempu, where he serves as the guardian of.
Which really is quite different than the 'rape victim falls into its mučitele'.
The fact that Jolie film really begins before the war, it is true.
Jolie notes that it is to pressure 'which is not fair and is based on erroneous information. "
Now it can release is already hekeři Hollywood: By illegally on the internet will publish its scenario, as it has already done many times.

Even counted until 2015 with 200,000 emigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million people that is a major loss.
If the predictions prove there is a similar wave of expatriate what protrpělo Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of the increase, which brought the great prosperity, is now once again extends neutěšenost.
The economic crisis znejišťuje, above all, young, educated people, who have so far seen only the rise.
The loss of a job and social decline seemed in the boom years of the absurd.
Needed was everyone was running out of money.
In the meantime, they are but three out of ten women and men in 30 years without a job.
In the Irish Times is a lot of letters of readers who complain: "In Ireland is everything from the hill."

About what it is like to build something somewhere else, knows no longer a half year Seán O Donovan.
Because 29-letý engineer in Ireland had any work is now employed, along with the 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
Just puts in Gelsenkirchen of the fashion house.
In January, continues to Hannoveru or in Berlin on another project.
On 'Donovan, meanwhile, is rarely gets home, because working in extra směnách to repay a home loan on the house.

The normal practice democracy
Support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprise.
Crime is of greater concern than the unemployment rate.
Brazil and many of the regions is considered more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of this survey, Latinobarómetro, which took place in 18 countries and originated exclusively friendly in The Economist.
Because the poll has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the whole area.
In this year's survey, which took place in September and at the beginning of October, is dominated by two related things.
The first of these is that Latin America is quite a happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in a number of countries on the periphery of the Pacific in South America has risen markedly (see chart 1).
For example, in Peru, where he is from the 2002 economic growth in average of 6% a year, increased support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Rose also in Mexico, where the economics zotavovala after a deep decline in output in the last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous areas, are Democrats, the conviction which is withdrawing the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the whole area, satisfaction in their country, how democracy works in practice, it is about the same number as last year, but in comparison with the year 2001, when it was about 25%, it is a huge increase in (chart 3).
Approximately 34% said that they trusted sněmu in their country and 45% trust the government, and, once again, this is about the same number as last year, but it is a big difference in comparison to the year 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, has undermined democracy in Latin America of the economic crisis.
Support was created during the global financial crisis is likely to be for this reason that many Latin American countries have suffered only a brief recession and even with a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net to help protect poor people.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, this week announced that the ratio of Latin Americans living in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009, and this year, once again, it has fallen to 32%).
But the mood is changing, in a broad spectrum from country to country (see chart 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of the outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in the widely acclaimed sense of progress.
This situation is rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been serious, and the situation has deteriorated with violent crime.
Only the second time since the surveys began to see more of respondents across Latin America as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
Roughly 31% saying that either they or their close relatives have become in the last year, the victims of crime, but this is a drop in the figure compared with 38% from last year, and is also the lowest number since 1995.
Robust economic performance is reflected in the growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: Around 71% of respondents across the area, says that private business is essential for development, this percentage has risen from 56% in 2007 (see chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will enable the development of their countries, this percentage has risen from 47% from last year.
Interesting is that 62% of respondents in Venezuela has the same opinion (and 80% of it supports private enterprise), even though their left-wing President Hugo Chávez expropriating many private firms.
Brazil is a country which has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared with 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year, unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared with 11% in the past year).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country subjects in Mexico and in large parts of Central America, and Venezuela enjoys success in the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Nicaragua.
Elections criticised
No one expected that the general election will be in Haiti, on 28 November perfect.
But they were far worse than outsiders, who are trying to help the country to be afraid of.
The elections marked with the box and recurring vote, the ballot paper after rozmetané channels, rozbité polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations open after hours of delays.
Many Haitians, including many přestěhovaných because of the January earthquake, potulovalo around and trying to find out where they can go to vote.
Some of them eventually.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several of the projected předběžců screaming that this is a sham and called for the cancellation of the election.
The protests, some of them violent, have spread across the country.
Yet Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said that "in many ways this was a very good choice '.
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, said cautiously that "they do not believe that these irregularities, whether they were serious, although not necessarily to the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral body, whose voices are bound to René Prévalovi, unpopular outgoing President and his candidate Jude Célestinovi, is to announce preliminary results on 7 December.
The crucial contest is planned for January.
Election all hope is not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly raper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have walked out from its original challenges to the vote was declared invalid.
But a problem can arise if Mr Célestin, which has a small or negligible support among voters, will be labelled electoral Commission for a decisive contest.
Řádící because of the cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people who after the earthquake are still living in tents, there were fears that the turnout will be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of the dezorganizace they have been avoided.
Roughly 250,000 identity cards, which are essential for the vote remained nerozdělené shortly before the election.
The stakes are high.
Donors see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so it is clear that the Haitians themselves will.
After leaders in the centres
In the weeks when suddenly ovdověla, Cristina Fernández, Argentine president has benefited from sympathy to the public, when its popularity has grown from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since it was elected in 2007.
Yet this success in reversing the successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections could depend on whether truchlící Mrs Fernándezová give up its intransigence of my late husband, the predecessor and political partner Néstora Kirchnera.
And all of these features will be based.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy, and then, as his wife successfully became president, he was in the habit of budgeting that downgrading tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional revenue as it pleases.
Mrs Fernándezové the government lost its majority in Congress in the last year.
But the opposition is divided and has further destabilised in the death of Mr Kirchnera heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement they acceded to Ms Fernández.
But after the chaotic meetings (on which the fackování and accusing the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve a budget for 2011.
"I am not going to fall out," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply for next year, and the president will have more room to spend as it pleases.
Excessively economy is overheating: This year, it is likely to grow up to 9%.
The official inflation rate is now at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unionists talk about the issue, which is close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was plagued by a economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than to control inflation.
Has refused to deal with the IMF, the burden on the private sector and cleanse the INDEC, statistical agency, which has started to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can now president Fernándezová moderate this policy?
Called for negotiations between private business and trade union leaders.
And its officials say that they want to limit the growth of wages in the next year to 18%.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for Argentine exports of agricultural products.
But inflation eroded growth based on large devaluation in 2002.
This may be one reason why the president gives Fernándezová know that it wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government has created an agreement with holders of bonds, who earlier rejected a debt restructuring, which Argentina in 2001, then.
The president now faces Fernándezová agreement with creditor governments, which are united in the Paris Club, which owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always insisted that this was not in sight of the IMF, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund will provide "technical assistance" to the proposed new national spotřebitelsko-cenový index, which will be the first to remind cleaning the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether Ms president Fernándezová will want to remain in politics after the end of the term, if the husband is not after its side.
If it wants to be, it needs to win the support of the middle classes, which is tired kirchnerismem.
At the time of the Argentine's return from their summer holidays, which is held in March, will be a wave of sympathy decline.
If it wants to win the next election, it will have to decide whether to waive silently many opinions that her husband in politics.
Half the encouragement for China
Taiwanští voters are closer to close links with the mainland.
Taiwan think about what his big brother over the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of eligible, voted on 27 November the mayor and the city council in five urban constituencies, which can be viewed as a wider assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is representative of feeling, which is a lot of land, and have a strong commitment in business relations, including an agreement on the part of the settlement, in the largest free trade relations with China since 1949.
President Ma has passed the test, but only just.
Although his party, the Kuomintang (KMT) ended a three from five offices mayor, has failed to win the majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence for Taiwan, won almost 50% of the vote against 45% of the KMT.
If it was about the presidential election, should President Ma in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the proportion of votes of his party, has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP, together with the KMT in urban councils.
The elections took place as the majority of Taiwan's elections, which include the noisy trucks and mass assembly with vlaječkami the scantily oděnými girls.
He was even part of the compulsory tajemný an assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chana, honest chairman of the KMT was canvassing for candidates KMT, on the eve of the elections.
A man from the crowd shot across the face of the young Mr Lien purely zranil and killed him, the spectator.
- it has not been determined whether had ozbrojenec intend to hurt Mr Liena or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the DPP, said that the shooting influenced elections, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only great for the winner of the campaign, China.
It was noticeable how to remain in the background, the question of the mainland.
Instead, the candidates zápolili about the plans for the construction of public housing and create jobs.
Taiwan are usually uses its de facto independence and hates the military threat from China.
The KMT has a tendency to avoid any links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also refrain from vzbuzování anti-čínských positions.
This is a response to reality, and the realisation that the Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
President Ma for his party confirmed that China's policy is for the majority of Taiwan's acceptable.
From the government in Beijing can be expected to continue in the commercial bribes, together with its strategy to Taiwan lured back into the fold.
China implement it without losing time in sending the negotiators into Taipeje to arrange a summit on the protection of investments and medical collaboration.
It would also like to see the political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait for the presidential elections in 2012.
The DPP, in any case, was itself.
Two years ago, was on the wrong level: Its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to jail on charges of corruption.
The president was in 2000-08 rabble-rouser and supporter of clear of independence.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai has developed a new generation, which is modest and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai was provolávána as DPP candidate for President, such as Suu Tseng-changem, who held the office under Mr Chenem.
Their party is currently doing everything to has shown that they can also work with Beijing.
Ms Tsai published plans for research institutes, which serves as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms Tsai Taiwan told the public that her party is "a credible alternative to the" hasty approach Mr Ma to China.
Mr Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In a statement issued from his cell expressed the view that the DPP candidates would be a better place if insisted that Taiwan is a part of the country.
Even ordered Mr Suu, pragmatikovi not to stand for president.
But even without the intervention of Mr Chena the DPP will fight the choice among potential candidates.
The KMT is justified to search their own people.
The assessment of Mr Ma was bad, and despite the rapid rate of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to go into the campaign with him.
His unpopularity seems to be based in particular on the unemployment and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.
The KMT spokesman says that přeorganizuje his cabinet, as well as the local branches.
Strongly put forward proposals to support Taiwan for a rapprochement are limited.
At the same time, as the majority of the people of Taiwan's economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chianga, immigrant publicisty, 'point of no return has passed. "

Critics have attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to the suspension of trade.
However, the judges decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in line with local laws and esteticky impressive.
"Many good people have to support this project - Christians, Jews, who will recall," said Hadi Nael, the chairman of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.

Microbes with resistance to arsenic raise the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere
The discovery of strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, extends the scope of the search for new forms of life on Earth, and perhaps even further.
The researchers found an unusual bacterium here on Earth, and says that this is a sign that life has opportunities that are outside the main elements that have been seen and fundamental.
"This organism has double the capacity."
"Growth can either thanks to the phosphorus or arsenic.
"This is a very strange, but this is not proof that this is a form of 'truly' mimozemského life," commented the fact that Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, it was considered essential to the life of the six key elements - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and síra.
However, the researchers found that the bacteria discovered in Mono Lake in California, they are able to continue to grow as the arsenic replace the phosphorus.
"You begin to wonder what is still possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth, because researchers must be able to recognise the life and know how life can be, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, the report on this novince published that has been discussed, which neprozrazovala details of the discovery, provoking widespread speculation on the internet, the report reveals that the discovery mimozemského life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to take advantage of the other elements that drive biochemistry and that set of the elements that we consider the 'standard', may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is unusual, because it shows the replacement of one element of the other element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure Cockell," he added.
This was not a random judgement.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from Astrobiologického Institute at NASA, which led the study, focused on Mono Lake, since it has a high level of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements thought, therefore, that mikrob, which is exposed to the elements, it may be able to replace the one in the second.
'Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behaviour is very similar to the phosphorus.'
"The result is that the organisms can be very difficult to these elements separated."
"However, the arsenic is so different that, as well as phosphorus is not working. If it gets into the body, to begin work on the biochemical processes," explained Anbar.
Scientists collected bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and increasing the concentration of arsenic, bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes are better at of phosphorus, but, given that they can survive with substitute arzenem, increasing the possibility that the form of life that use arsenic can occur naturally, and that either elsewhere on Earth, or on another planet or months ago, where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, a technical assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by a used, is not new, but they will never be found, for example, with the fact that this was achieved.
Arsenic was more common in the old days at the Earth, she said, and the scientists speculate that it could use previous forms of life.
"This suggests that it could be other ways to create life, not only in the way that he has created in the early period of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the research team Wolfe-Simona.
The research was supported by the organisation, NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the Ministry of Energy

Peek and Rickard, who live in Reddingu are this weekend in the city to take part in the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, where they had planned to demonstrate Trace.
Other dogs should compete in other competitions, planned in the days before the show AKC / Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times newspaper on Wednesday.
South California is the only one destination to almost monthly travel after psích a couple of exhibitions.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard registered in motelu.
Often they sleep in motelech and parkují his car in front of the bedroom window.
They also took three dogs - štěně boxera, Parson Russell teriéra and bretaňského ohaře - who stayed with them in motelovém room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car, which should be colder.
A little pootevřeli windows in a car that had dogs enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of cars in the 6 o'clock in the morning on Tuesday.

The lion is once again ready to řvát now, when the restructuring of MGM gets final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty company MGM finally received the green light to start again.
Insolvency of a federal judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed 'zabalenému in advance' plan to creditors to settle about $5 billion of debt and to clear the way for 86 years old entertainment company which focuses on production and the production of films and television shows.
Thursday's return, a plan that meets the requirements of bankruptcy law, the US is left MGM no legal obstacles to restart the founder of Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main leaders zeštíhleného study.
The number of employees will fall to around 320 of the original more than 400.
MGM has suddenly nevynoří from Chapter 11, while JPMorgan Chase agreed to the planned financial resources for a loan in the amount of $500 million to finance a new operations and the production of MGM.
Now it is a combination of the investment bank, which itself needs $75 million, and the funding is expected to be around half of December.
The restructuring process study began in May 2009, when it was najata investment bank Moelis & Co., to challenge management, how to deal with their finances, because management fought for it to be able to afford the interest payments in the amount of $300 million per year.
This August was President Harry Sloan replaced by Stephen Cooperem, the former Director-General of Enron and an expert on the turnover, known for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts their work.
Moelise Coopera and attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 creditors of study, it has taken much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 to give the company for sale.
Although the auction attracted few bids, none of them was willing to pay $2 billion plus finances, which called for the lenders.
In the spring of this year, everything was back to rýsovacím prkně and the team began work on a plan to restructure MGM. After months of discussing and internal disagreements in the end, the plan was approved by the creditors by the end of October.
When MGM in the coming weeks, the rise of officially bankrupt, firms Moelise Coopera for their work and receive multi-million bonuses in dollars.
Society Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive the payment of $9.5 million.
Cooperovy firms that inkasují for their services, which follows the course of the company, at $375 per month, will receive a reward for success, the so-called 'a success fee "$4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which this year has issued only one film and put together a proposal for the seven or eight films, which will be at the beginning of 2012.
Also planned to participate in the financing of the two films, whose předlohou will book 'Hobit', and that, together with Warner Bros.
Studio needs to negotiate special loan between 265 million and $275 million dollars to zafinancovalo its share of these two films, which will be režírovat Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who own about 18% of the debt for the study of the possibility of a merger of MGM with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies nevyústily in the agreement.
Technological toys, which will keep your budget in balance gifts
Leading candidate this year is the greatest toy iPad, for which follows videoherní system. In both cases, but this is a significant intervention in the budget for the gifts.
Consider that for the price of one iPadu you can buy five rounds of BMX for 99 dollars and one game Kinect stands as well as the 10 korálkových švihadel or approximately 48 kelímků Play-Doh.
But there is a way to keep your budget for gifts in the balance.
I recently visited three national retailers toys - Wal-Mart, Toys' R US and BJ's Wholesale Club, and watched what electronic toys that I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that operates Mooreův law; this year's technological toys have a lot more energy, and at the same price, if not a little lower, compared with past years.
While there are relatively fewer new toys with its affiliated Web sites, two of the most familiar toys of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offers more.
Increasing the number of toys with knoflíkovými batteries, as well as toys with batteries nabíjecími.
Here are some of the recommendations.
(All these prices are from the Toys' R 'of the US, in addition to the cases which are demarcated otherwise.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years) are plyšová zvířátka that singing when they stisknete bříško.
In one stisknutí zvířátko the tone and the second will hold will create a song.
If you buy more than one, will be singing and harmoniously together.
Warning: Once you start mačkat, you cannot stop.
The best option in the combined zpěvu and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, 60, from $2 years)
Last year I put on Elmo Live Technology to lend 14 palcovou animatrickou panenku, which can play a game of Simon Says and can also monthly walking through its innovative sklopné leg with blocking the rounds.
Children have found a toy Mickey tanečního instruktora, although their parents complained about the lack of control of the volume.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you may recall the Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.

The introduction of a more subtle police controls in China
As urban military instructor, get Tang Shenbin after Tiananmen, strictly controlled their orders and issuing orders polohlasně with military authority.
I to female member - Chinese statné vymahatelky urban order, the dreaded and opovrhované for their crackdown and penchant for violence - to facilitate a certain impression on kolemstojících small crowd gathered.
"You should be evenly! '
"Hurry up!"
Show them šeptá quietly, 'how they look nice girls! "
Four very young girls in white rukavicích and the same olivových kabátech and shorts by the ball.
Four couples black shoes are seřazeny as under pravítka.
Four cap is sitting at the head of a perfect vlasech, which are perfectly tied the blue and white stuhami.
"Personally, I think that, on average," said disdainfully Mr Tang.
'Models are fine. "
More than one government has tried to boost the image of urban dozorců in China.
One city ordered to new recruits have a university education.
Guangdong province has changed uniforms šedo-zelené on the supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China has replaced upřené views for a strong hardware: In 2009, the report said that in one of the 50 officers were surrounded by stubborn svačinami a wheelchair ramp, and hard on homeowners looking to retailers podomní after a half hour sbalil and went.
Xindu, urban districts with 680 000 people in Chengdu, for the main image opted for the operation.
Since 2003 the police add their urban districts of 13 women who were selected according to their specific appearance, souměrnosti and a young age.
The aim is to show apart from the gross aspects of the police also softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson itself should trouble to have entered secret Chinese urban groups.
Critics have argued for good reason.
Unlike the police, it is these the police only allowed to promote urban vyhlášku, to impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But Chinese media routinely capture a different reality.
In January 2008, the police inspectors from the province of Hubei utloukli neutral spectator to death after he used his phone to the recording, as on in cracking down on protest against a landfill.
In the last year has taken place police training in Beijing, the guide to this training was hijacked and placed on the Internet. In the manual was, among other things, the description of how effectively zmlátit perpetrators without signs of blood.
This year, the trader podomní with melouny in Shanghai in brawls with five policemen and suffered injuries to the left side of the brain.
One videohra full of violence, which can be downloaded on the Internet, shows Chinese policeman, as attacking street retailers.
'Chengguan terrorized the government, "the China Daily, the national edition naříkala last year, after further discussion about the tactics.
On paper it 'really thoroughly cleaning'.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After the districts inzeroval in October, interest on eight new female policistek, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real obligations or are only withdrawing.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
Okres demanded the female uchazečky in age from 18 to 22 years old with a good figure and 'five facial features in the correct proporci.'
Adeptky prices should be higher than the average - higher than the 1.6 metres.
Výslužba at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials have said that the work is mentally too difficult for women over 25 years.
"Their image is an important thing," said one police officer at nejmenovaný Rednet.com as if government websites.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external quality, which then determine another, among them, the amount of weight, facial features and so on. '
Then comes the nature and 'internal quality'.
Women are as květinové vázy, he said, and added, "In addition to that, they will also have other vázami responsibility. '
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the leadership of the county town, with the power of this description.
But point out that the demands on the size, are common in China, as well as for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the demand for souměrné facial features.
Which means that the issue of a good image is the subject of discussion between the Chinese.
Disabled or mutilation is certainly not apply.
"We cannot allow us to serve chromý or hrbatý man," said Mr Zheng.
"His image, it is not good."
Liu Yi, which holds the Tiananmen Baoguang patrol in the vicinity of the monastery, has 22 years, faces as jablíčka and gently tvarovaná mouth.
We do not consider that the emphasis on her appearance could have sexistický character, she said.
'Do you think that, in this uniform vypadám sexy? "she asked with ironickým view.
Her fellow member with dolíčkama, 21-letá Xu yang says' Our job is to represent the image of the city. "
They do not object to their limited performance, said, because their career ambitions are more than just zahánět traders in the aisles, where they can carry out their work.
Every morning is the group against more than ten trhovcům who they are running on foot or on the rounds and trying to sell them as soon as possible and knedlíčků misek tofu before they are thrown out.
'Mr Wangu, you have to go'.
"We have already told you very much!" She said, when Ms Xu trhovec began to run, and at the time he left his round with vozíkem with nudlemi.
Police describe their duties as more monotónní than painful.
"Every day it is essentially the same thing," said Huang Jing, 20, who is studying in their vacations marketing.
'A great routine. "
One of the reasons is that the female policistky have powers as their male counterparts, so that they can seize goods retailers.
Can only threaten the fact that the report of its male leadership.
The tendency is to protect them against sudden public displays of hostility against maladministration apparatus, which are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of people in the capital of the province of Yunnan, Kunmingu, after the revolt of spreading false rumours that policisti killed by the seller.
More than 10 police officers or police officers were injured in the small hours of the night; 14 government vehicles was převráceno or zapáleno.
Xindu yet such violence has been leaked.
But calm can be guaranteed only barely.
Only two blocks from the square, where calm Baoguang this morning should watch on a street corner, policistky gathered more than 50 people.
Police seized a motorbike which opravoval chodníku to place inside supermarkets, as required by the law.

Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator přičleněný to male group, stayed behind, his white badge is reversed to skrylo his name.
As well as the female policistky, coordinators are men over 40 years, who have only have a role to play.
Unlike them are not educated in the maintenance and uhlazování image.
"Sometimes we have to."
"Sometimes we are fighting physically," said Mr Li in practical terms.
"Most of it is the public, which starts with this. '
Prosecutors do not blame Senator Ensigna
Prosecutors Senator John Ensigna redeem the Department of Justice, from the criminal allegations concerning his affair with a former adviser to the campaign, and his efforts to ensure the lobby, announced on Wednesday, Senator lawyers.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Republican, faced nevadský and who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012. The affair has risen to national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensigna Office said that it was a decision that was followed almost annual investigation, '' certainly pleased.
Senator could still face disciplinary action for ethics commissions to the Senate.
Mr Ensigna lawyers have said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the aim of the investigation and that it is not in the plan to bring additional charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who argued that there are serious evidence that Mr Ensign was preparing a violation of the ban on federal lobbying.
The talks, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglasu Hamptonovi, one of his assistants, to secure lucrative lobby, which should lead to silence Mr Hamptona and his wife, Cynthie, senátorově proportion with it.
Mrs Hamptonová once worked as a pokladník Ensigna in the campaign.
Mr. Ensign was in contact with a number of political supporters, to find work for Mr Hamptona and supported their views after Mr Hamptona recruited to lobbied for them, citing documents and interviews.
Since Hampton was recently asistentem Mr Ensigna was by law from lobbying their former employers or the Senate of the year.
Ethics experts say that the unusual deal Mr Ensigna and Mr Hamptona, who were friends of the biggest, appeared at odds with the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that has been published, "it became clear that this is a clear case of violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients, who are investigating the government.
While officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the case of Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other lawyers specialising in ethics, said that the department is cautious with regard to political actions, after a number of setbacks, including the decision of last year to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator fill Ted Stevensovi allegations of misconduct in the middle of the state prosecutors' offices.
Federal prosecutors' clearly schovali weapons, "said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for responsibility and Ethics in Washington, DC), the advocacy group, which has a number of complaints against Mr Ensignovi.
"In fact, it shows that the high-level government officials, the law," they add.
Paul Coggins, the main lawyer Mr Ensigna, in an interview that he was told on Monday called for the state Department of Justice, and then the next day, and I told him that the department neshledalo no charges against his clients.
Defence document for Mr Ensigna team is cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to convince them that the Senator as his office to repeat in Wednesday's statement, "he has acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments that convey state representatives.
"I am not a pleasant líčit details of my discussions with the Ministry of justice in addition to that, we think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Election Commission has decided to halt an investigation into a separate complaint in which ethical group gives the accusation that payment parents Ensigna Hamptonům in the amount of $96,000 in violation of federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money would not anything other than a gift.
One company, for which Mr Ensign helped Mr Hamptonovi find lobbying work, was firm NV Energy, the main nevadská the company, which has long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that, after Mr Hampton began in society to work as a lobbyist, Mr Ensigna staff, John Lopez - interact with Mr Hamptonem and told him that 'bušil "in the Ministry of the Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr Hamptonem and other nevadským klientem, Allegiant Air and urged the transport minister to a meeting he had finished speaking on behalf of airlines after najmou Mr Hamptona on lobbying work.
When the last year, for the first time, a report on the affair, Mr Ensign has apologized to his constituents and resigned from his post as the fourth Republican leadership in the Senate.
After many months' stagnation Mr Ensign told reportérům two weeks ago that it planned to take part in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign no longer the investigation of a criminal offence, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes that the ethical Commission will be quickly followed by the Department of Justice and an end to the investigation.
"Senator Ensign are to continue their hard work in the name of nevadského of the people," she said.
The Cheshire community turns on Twitter
In the ranks of the courtroom, half a dozen written.
Minute by minute sending reports about the horrendous testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says that more than 140 000 reports on Twitter handle rape and přivazováním children to postelím, who was living in the house.
On Thursday, the trial was Steven J. Hayese, who has been convicted of killing three citizens of Cheshire, Connecticut, families, and should take place by imposing the official end to the death penalty, for which jury voted.
But Mr Hayese lawyers have already made a court appeal with the demands and arguments that a court probably employed years.
One nejprovokativnějších is that intensive reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter - the reporters' cirkusovou create an atmosphere of "and this widespread, immediate the penetration of information with pobuřujícími details then erected porotu in the decision in terms of influencing public opinion.
This could force the judge to look at the question of whether, with the arrival of new technologies do not demand also the new rules in the courtroom.
"As I have experienced in this trial, I think that there is a real danger that the integration of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of fair trial for the individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the main advocate of Mr Hayese.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue senior state court rejected claims relating to yield briefly last week, and with the fact that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there is no evidence that would show that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But it is not likely to be the last word in this case.
For decades the courts recognise that the coverage of these notorious cases may lead to questions about the fairness of the process.
In a regulation from 1966 the United States Supreme Court has overturned the conviction of clevelandského chiropraktika, Dr Sam Shepparda for the murder of his wife, when in his decision, he said that in the case of the Sheppard versus Maxwell, in the process, because of the media was a 'karnevalovou atmosphere'.
Some are convinced that this offence was the inspiration of the television show and the movie 'fugitive'.
Some lawyers said that the appeal courts, which examine Hayesův judgment about half a century later, they could be surprised by the argument that it may be necessary to the new rules, which will determine the way of communication of the courtrooms, which was in the case of Dr Sheppard unimaginable.
"There is a common cause for concern about the impact of new media 'in highly sought cases, said John J. Donohue III, a law professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticutu and wrote the report, which said that it was made at random.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be pleased with the idea that the restriction on the immediate communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The case of Twitter is just one of the many lawyers outlined by Mr Hayese, who would be able to argue for years, on the row.
Advocates also argues, for example, that in the case of Mr Hayese may be a bias when Blue judge refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential porotců by them in selecting poroty nahánějící horror show a photograph of the criminal.
Some of porotců said that they were appalled by photos of victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates argue that also refuse the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge improperly dismissed each judge chooses, which was critical of the representatives of the state, and that its decision incorrectly used more pressure on the verdict and směroval porotu to on the weekend.
Porotci were decoupled.
But their arguments about the impact of the extent of the process may attract the most interest.
In a point of order against the verdict vzneseném said last month that the case dominated reports in Connecticutu and has been discussed during the election campaign, the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States.
Argued that the media constantly rozdmýchávaly the flames of emotions in this case.
'Daily influx of media cameras and reporters in front of the court, "the lawyer wrote,' was something here in New Havenu has still not been to see, and it is also perhaps a nationwide raritu. '
Their focus on the interaction of Twitter is controversial.
Some journalists in the talks said that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the later report and from their point of view, should the judicial police to manage the scope of other processes.
But some lawyers asked for the appeal courts with often used arguments that the social and technological changes require adaptation of the courts.
Lawyers for Mr Hayese seek this right.
In its archives to be referred to the Supreme Court decision in 1966 in the wake of the verdict, Dr Shepparda because of the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," wrote, "it is a case of the Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Civility can overcome the gap?
After a campaign which was remarkable for its urážlivostí and negativismem, this week in Washington, there are a small number of courtesy.
This is a good sign of genuine cooperation between the two political parties or only iluzivní moment before the rapid return to the party in the fight in the city?
The pitiful the agenda of President Obama, and parliamentary leaders produced no major discoveries about the fundamental issues that must be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, but it was a respectful discussion of differences of views of the two sides, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode party wrangling.
Wednesday's public session of the president's deficit commission was also a civilized, and despite political differences that remain between members.
It seems that it is clear that the close collaboration over several months built up a mutual respect, which transcends the ideological divide, which still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to argue that, at the start of a new era of cooperation.
Both parties are now in a period of time - sondují other signs of collegiality and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards renewed partisan war.
It was therefore also úterní negotiations and its subsequent assessment of participants carried out with minimum requirements or recrimination.
Philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to proposed rapid change the conditions that are there the last two years.
Whether it is on the issue of taxes, spending, health care or rights, both of the two sides are miles away.
However, the November elections, at least by Washington quickly.
"It is not a question of whether the regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's this, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"Those are inevitable after the election.
Pump up those emotions straníků elections and then utichli.
This is a good thing. '
In several issues, especially those that are to be discussed at the meeting, the Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush's tax cuts would expire at the end of the year and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of this, and permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, as a likely compromise on unemployment benefits only because the Republicans cannot look at how to support the tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed refuse to support in unemployment.
After meeting Tuesday in the White House is already see greater optimism about the possible agreement on those issues, along with the opening of the ratification of the new treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out, that the successful cooperation on major issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties, when 112. Congress convening in January.
Rather, it is the likely period of disagreements, or even inevitable, he said.
"Then, as do the things that must be done in the short term, psychology to return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that courtesy will be real cooperation.
"I am looking at all of the events between now and 2012 as shadow box number, where the main events will occur in 2012," he said.
Reasons largely related to compiling the new Republican majority in the White House and the voters Tea parties who helped draft it.
Republican leaders now faces a danger Over-dramatisation, they know that it must live up to its promises and must reduce costs to the government and to repeal the new law on health care.
These přívrženecké lines are clear in its initial response to the recommendations on the deficit, which include a reform of the tax code and raising some taxes, an increase in the retirement age and a reduction in spending.
Two chairmen, Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles are taking on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to their view, the question of the pressure the deficit to the programme in ways that cannot be ignored.
They need but 14 votes in 18-ti členné Commission to be able to present their plan as an official recommendation and fought, therefore, that this figure as soon as possible.
The greatest opposition is between being elected officials, who are proposing that, in the case of the financial issues we have, at least today, small foundations or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phase in the battle between the White House and the Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts where Republicans will call on Obama to resolve the budget, taxes and health care, which will be followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What is causing the shift?
Public opinion.
There are a lot of evidence that, despite the partisanship in the last elections, the majority of Americans wants to continue to see the two sides to work together.
If could be heading for a stalemate, as was the case in 1995, then both sides are very closely monitor the response of the public.
Anyone would be a reduction of the votes, to change course and probably will seek a compromise.
That may be optimistic view on the matter.
Stranickost and guidelines are now greater than it was in the 1990s, and it turns out that the more ideological divide between Obama and the Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to the most important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, courtesy, which appeared this week, would prefer to see a lot of Americans.
But it will be a lot of efforts on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide is.
In the US, the leaked document describes Moscow as a refuge corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of the 'kleptocracy checked', and that is part of the corruption and bribes for protecting that come his way into Kremlinu, give American ambasáda in Russia in records from February.
The police and security service Federal largely keeps the protective wing, which help to explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
Collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Each layer of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called 'vertikála office' - will take their money, when they start to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of John Beyrleho ambasadora, was on Wednesday published by WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on sources whose names were redigována.
The record was written in a time when it was still mayor Yuri Luzhkov and accuses him of a large share of the corruption.
He was fired in October President Dmitry Medvedevem, but since then we can monitor only minimal changes in očistě.
Luzhkov, and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who own a prominent construction company, for many years, constantly denying the allegations of corruption, and won a number of legal actions for křivé charges for such accusations.
In September, said on Russian television station when he was asked about the proven evidence of corruption: 'This is crazy, this is špína is svinstvo.'
The Russians with absolute conviction, believes that if their company is corrupt, that will become apparent on the vote.
But it is unusual to meet with such details vyřčenými in such a way, and not in the report, and it is also ambasádní unheard of, that it would do so diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of the city of Moscow and its links with the criminal elements have led some to question it 'dysfunctional,' and confirm that the government operates more like a kleptocracy checked than as the government," says the report.
"Criminal elements of the so-called 'krysha' (the term from the world of prison and the Mafia, which literally means' the roof 'or protection), which provides them with the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Department of the Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as elsewhere in government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
'Analysts have identified and třístupňovou structure in Moscow crime-inducing the world.'
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
'The Federal Security Service, the Department of the Interior and the militia are at the other end.'
"And, finally, the lowest level of the ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
'It is ineffective system in which criminal groups are filling empty seats in some areas since the city does not provide some of the services'.
The report says that the FSB takes money from the largest firms and the police is focused on smaller businesses.
One source said the owners' shops in Moscow recognize that it is better to get protection from the FSB, or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), because they are not only more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but they are also protected by the law. "
"For this reason, for protection from criminal gangs, not so in the rate '.
The record says that while the choice of money is a comprehensive, protecting itself may have difficulties; even those who pay, can sometimes be arrested.
Those who do not pay enough, their business under various guises by the closing.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he acknowledged that has made little progress.
Ambasádní the report speaks of the men taking bags, probably napěchovanými cash, governments in the Kremlinu.
"In its fight against corruption with Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," he said in a recent interview, Georgy Satarov, the director of the Moscow research team Indem.
"But it is a part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia for the political class, no. '
Without the politicians with no opposition, without the division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that the nationwide increase corruption is Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154. place in a recent survey of global corruption perceptions of the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ordered from the least to most corrupt).
The report by the American Embassy in Moscow was only in the late evening hours certainly has caused in the Russian government enthusiasm, although only to the extent that for Moscow's shortcomings may be accused of Luzhkov, it may be able to argue for the Kremlin, as in the case of a solution to the problem.
In an interview for CNN with Larry Kingem told Putin that the documents that WikiLeaks published could be counterfeit and to comment on the statement that American diplomats call Medvedeva Batman and Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that it is about our mutual collaboration, which is an important factor in domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, nedomnívali we that it will be carried out with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so neeticky. '
Khmer Khmérů veterans are forced to come to terms with the past
In the poorly lit concrete classroom with zašpiněnými and oloupanými walls recall Anlong Veng High School, the director of the school, the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"All of us love Ta Moka. '
"He was a good leader and look after our own people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as' butcher 'for their violence during the rule of the Khmer Rouge, remains commander in this remote državě of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, where the popular built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where there are still thousands of former soldiers of the organisation.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered government is nabouraná long-standing loyalties also in Anlong Vengu.
In April, for the victims in the forum of the truth and reconciliation are allowed to publicly confront with people who were part of the regime.
In June the government to provide textbooks, which for the first time the children to explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers.
And in July, the court asked the UN and Kambodžský the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the judgment of the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng a thuggish associations, Kaing Khek Iev, známějšího as the spirit to 35 years in prison.
With every kind of progress had been increasing unrest among the veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, which complicates efforts to bring about reconciliation and their attempts to engage in Cambodia's society.
'Between the former Khmer Rouge is resentment and fear, but are powerless to do anything, "said Youk Chhang, the Documentation Centre Cambodia, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"For them it was a wonderful life between the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil '.
It divides the 'family'.
During the rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or recast.
When the Vietnamese have invaded and toppled the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its soldiers fled Kambodžskou on the border with Thailand.
They launched a rebellion that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary by guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok kultivoval supporters in Anlong Vengu.
But in the mid-1990s, after the peace agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country has been conducted for the first democratic elections in 1993,. A large group of fighters of the Khmer Rouge began to switch to the government, which culminated in a kapitulací Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and president Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who stayed, it was in 1999, he was kidnapped by government forces in nedalých Dangrek mountains.
Phnom Penhském died in prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons, most of them already nepečovali former fighters of the Khmer Rouge have already gone down into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them cast a nostalgic recalls for the duration of the movement.
Although a few of the elite of the Khmer Rouge to retain their local government's position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, as unskilled farmers.
"These people should surrender only the minimum benefit," said Leang shock of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which is leading the public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by a Utopian agrarian ideology regime."
'Were vychování without any ideas on the implementation of the business'.
Sor Lim, 55, who came to Rudým Rouge as a teenager in 1974, he fought in the jungle around Anlong Vengu before settle as poor farmer in 1998.
'Life under the Khmer Rouge was good, "he said.
'The Mok all support'.
"But now, life is tough, because we all need to ensure ourselves. '
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge also has caused concern.
At the beginning of next year, the start of a trial to investigate Nuon Chea, president Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court has a mandate to prosecute leading přestavitele and the people responsible for the crimes, but has not said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was little to calm fears in Anlong Vengu.
Recent media speculation focused on im Chaema, 64, who was a local leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, said medication from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that oversees the construction of dams Trapeang Thma, the project, which is likely to have killed thousands of forced workers.
The recent parný evening, im Chaem returned from work in the field of in its dřevěného house on the dirty track outside of Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to sestupovat and there were shadows across the arid grass, im Chaem refused to talk about their past between the Khmer Rouge.
If it is called, would be rejected by the court.
"In Cambodia is peace and it is stable," she said.
"If they will explore further prosecutions, will the war."
The prime minister, Hun Sen, who přeběhl from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also has repeatedly warned that it would lead to instability, if the Court will seek other suspects, although the experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must vykopat deep hole and bury it in the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what it must do for Cambodia, the movement forward, Youk Chhang said of the Documentation Centre.
'Reconciliation in khmerským circumstances means to cobble together pieces of smashed, "he said.
"It is our duty to give these rozbité pieces together, so that we may understand."
The center has issued the first textbook on the Khmer Khmerech approved by the government, has 75 parties and the title of 'History democratic Cambodia. "
Was distribuovaná in Anlong Vengu in June as an addendum to the textbook history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four sides to Khmer Khmerech.
Like many people in Cambodia, as well as young people in Anlong Vengu knew only a few details about the Khmer Khmerech, despite the city's links with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the middle school in Anlong Veng, said that the new textbooks helps students understand the important part of their history.
But his parents have reacted skeptically when took home the book to the study.
'My family refuses to many parts of the books, and the courts, "he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will be prosecuted."
Such opposition is more complex and difficult process of reconciliation, shock Leang said.
But public forum, textbooks and justice are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge are still strong.
Up in the mountains of the Dangrek Mountains zarostlá pests and vysypaná odhozenými plastic bags before boarding their flight, which leads to obdélníku of black soot, pokrytého zrezivělou plechovou roof.
Body Pol Pot here have been burnt down on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, prodavačka mobilů on the edge of the road, said that he did not know much about the man who was at that point, the zpopelněn.
"But it has a strong spirit, many of the local people here go and pray for him," she said.
Sothea Nuom should birthday and was in the plan later to visit a place of rest, Pol Pot, where the union will mature bananas in the hope that it will bring good luck.
Belarus agrees that seems to be their stocks of weapons on the basis of uranium.
In did with its surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world, has announced the government of Belarus on Wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of a nuclear weapon.
The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement, issued after a security summit, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergeiem Martynov.
The US government, after years of trying to persuade the Belarus to surrendered highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the stumbling block up last spring.
But American officials have told The Washington Post that in the last two months has been with Belarus carried a classified operations, in order to eliminate 187 pounds of arms on the basis of uranium from the Belarusian research facilities.
This paves the way for an agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - approximately £500, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is a sensitive issue.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's 47th national summit on nuclear security in April, which Belarus was excluded.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republics on the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want to place at the summit on nuclear bezpečnosti2012. '
"It shows that the process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement as "an important, very important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised, in Prague in April 2009, ensuring that all sensitive nuclear materials around the world in four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to get rid of all of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries have done so for the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's summit on nuclear safety announced by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that his nation will never give up its uranium.
"We have the highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos of what is, in essence, the basis for the weapon and less enriched uranium," he said then.
"This is our commodity... we are not going to produce dirty bombs and also we are not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it only for research purposes, that is all."
Belarus, however, a few months ago to join the United States, and we have an interest to reach an agreement.
The first commitment to eliminate the Belarusian uranium in October, was particularly complicated, because the material was slightly ozářen, officials announced.
Naložen was on a special train, which traveled more than 1 300 miles in the Russian equipment for storage and destruction, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out of the air, the officials said.
The US government spent more than $13 million for the program, most of it on the delivery of the research institute less enriched uranium, which is not appropriate for the production of nuclear weapons.
"Everything was zkoordinováno very carefully and conducted on the basis of trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, the Department of Energy official working for Global Threat Reduction effort.
James Martin Center for the study on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year odhadovalo that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium applicable for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint statement, to seek the removal of its stocks by the year 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained over the years, mainly due to Lukašenkově brutal repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual thaw.
"We welcome the progress made in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that greater democracy and respect for human rights in Belarus remains the basis of improving mutual relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did with the CIA flights drahoty
The Spanish government did drahoty on CIA flights transporting trapped talibance and Al-Qaida members in Guantánamo via the Spanish ranges, as expressed in its telegramu envoy for the United States in Madrid.
It is clear from the documents provided by Wikileaks newspaper El País, which also reported that the first representative of the then Prime Minister María Teresa Fernándezová de la Vegová asked that Spain has been informed by the executive and 'could so to show that it is a proper supervision of foreign aircraft prolétajícími Spanish airspace. "
In June 2006, following the announcement of the Council of Europe, in which it was to address a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, held a meeting between the US ambassador and Eduard Aguirre Fernándezovou de la Vegovou.
A representative of the Prime Minister, said that the announcement of the Council of Europe 'vyňalo the Zapatero government from the Games' and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
DE la Vegová stressed that Spain does not have a problem with years ago of the secret services through its territory.
'Simply want to be informed, "not to be' zastiženi off-hand," Aguirre says in one of the documents.
Also, the foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, the American Ambassador, suggested that the Spanish government would "give this matter as soon as possible, but the fact that this matter was in the hands of judges, the government had limited opportunities to influence '.
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González told that the Embassy of the if it is, it does not intend to ask the judge to block the initiative odtajnění received the National Centre of the secret services (CNI) and Department of Defense relating to the CIA flights.
"This information contains no inkriminovanou component of no sensitive information," explained the Embassy of the following an interview with prokurátorem.
The US has expressed concern, however, because of the 'apparent coordination between Spanish judge and German prosecutors' than because of CNI odtajnění information or the Department of Defense.
'This coordination among independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments' regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the lunch the US ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaby told the ambassadors that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they considered the appropriate ', has commissioned its associates' instructions to avoid rozohněným comments with the intention of reducing tensions."
The ambassador also expresses its concern about the political negotiations, the Partido Popular Party (PP; Czech People's Party - which in this matter.
"Despite its universal pro-American Community-orientated our experience tells us that the Partido Popular party will not hesitate to take any suggestion that the government tolerated Zapaterova or deliberately ignored the US, which could be interpreted as a possible violation of human rights, and that even in the event that these revelations could have negative consequences for the government of the United States," it notes.

PP would gain 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia, which has lost 9 of the seats.)
With results from 28 November, the PP party could have a major say in municipalities in Léridě Taragona harbour, and Barcelona.
Following a significant increase in the number of votes and the number of experienced parliamentarians during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People's Party of Catalonia, which already has the idea of a general election, whether there will be an increase in or not, its prospects are more than positive because the number of votes in the nationwide elections is usually one such elections to the Catalan.
In 2008 gained katalánští PP 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the elections of the autonomous in 2006, this figure was only 316.222.
Last Sunday won the Popular Party of Catalonia (PPC) 384.091 voice.
If this trend increases, which was supported by the transfer of the votes from the PSC and loyalty PP voters, analysts have calculated that party, that if the elections are held, PPC could get 12 members in the House, compared to the current 8, the party Convergencia and Unió (CiU, Czech agreement and the EU - which would also win mandates 4 (now has 10), and the PSC would have lost at least 9 seats (now has 25).
These calculations would have confirmed that Catalonia is for the PP and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) of vital importance.
According to this analysis, the ERC people's Party (the Left of the Republican Party of Catalonia, which has lost one - now has 3 - while ICV (The green for Catalonia, which would continue to have a mandate, or would gain even one another.
However, according to the electoral calendar will be the nearest dostaveníčko held in May 2011, on the occasion of the municipal elections, which could also have a decisive impact on the PP the end of dominance by the Socialists in the four major provincial cities, as well as the changes in the Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 661 million euros for the year 2011.
Both nationalists and the PP coincide with the possibility that the PSC could lose Hall in Barcelona, Léridě Taragona harbour and Geroně, where the Socialists have received a majority, and would not have been able to turn to his traditional ally, the ERC and ICV.
Given the debacle of Republicans would have been impossible if this party has lost its representation in the Barcelona Representation - as it is to gain at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes in four major cities and could have a decisive impact in Barcelona, Léridě and Taragona harbour.
Nationalists are convinced that could play a major role in the turnaround in Taragona harbour, which was ruled by the PP, together with the party before the current mayor, Josepem Félixem Ballesterosem.
In Léridě the PP has only about 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has very good relations with Mariano Rajoyem - during the last campaign has met on several occasions.
A PP also on other major municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently the PP representation at 34 municipalities in Catalonia, I would like to create a candidate in what is perhaps the most municipalities.
The Catalan cell provided the al-Qaeda organisation thousands of passports
In addition to the seven people were arrested in Barcelona, the other three were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerijec, who were detained by agents of the Information komisařství in Barcelona, jihadist cell dirigistic from Thailand, which zařizovala passports Al-Qaida different groups, among whom were also 'Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' or 'Lashkar-e-Taiba', while the second group was the author of the bombings in Mumbai, in which 106 people have died in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior to the investigation of this matter of great importance, aims to ensure through the 'operations' Kampai weakening padělatelského apparatus al-Qaeda on the international level and "reduce its operational capacity".
Investigators estimate that the cell could during the two years, when it was in Catalonia active, to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then being faked and then supplied the groups, which are criminal galaxii Al-Qaida to their 'fighters' can travel with impunity across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This broken cell has not been the only active, which has a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore the investigation in addition to the Thai services also participated in other European police forces, and therefore cannot be ruled out that in the coming days will not happen in other European countries to similar intervention, such as the one in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when they were picked up by the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Mohammad Iftikhar Ahmad, Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerijec Babatunde Agunbiade) in Thailand was developed further, in which they were captured by the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thajec Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
It was precisely these men who ran from the Bangkok resident cell in Spain and another in other European countries.
The Catalan network, which was wound up in 2009, particularly tourists kradla passports, which meet the requirements of the Islamists.
This means that the documents had to be men aged between 25 and 45 years old, had to have the force of a few years, be without vyznačených visas.
In investigative documents it is pointed out that they are not aware of any facts that would combine detainees from Catalonia with Massoud in Mumbai, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba ', should be one of the groups, which received passports stolen in Spain and then falsifikované in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before that Massoud was sent from Catalonia transfer agency about $1,000 that were 'dumped' to buy cards for mobile phones that later were used by members of the "commandos", which killed 106 people.
Police have seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demanded Masovi to stop fiscal agreement
Party chairman PPC (Popular Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezový-Camachová yesterday personally had the opportunity to present Mr Masovi its conditions for which it is willing to support his induction into the post of President of the Generalitat; these conditions are similar to those proposed in the campaign and their priority is to stimulate the economy and the renunciation of risky enterprises such as economic agreement, which wants the leader of the nationalists to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people's has arrived at a meeting with Arturem meat safely 18 parliamentary seats received in the election last Sunday, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining approval ratings, so a candidate needs CiU that at least one of its formací the opposition abstained from the vote on his reappointment of office.
On the possible agreement with the PP is dependent on the future of the alliance, which they would like to keep the nationalists in the House, will take place after the general election, but so far the talks, which results in these days of the masses with the rest of the political leaders are in Catalan spirit.
As regards to the PP to win her support for the office, 'will have to do away with all sovereign and osvobozeneckými speeches', as well as with the economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - on which I leader of CiU even to vote in the referendum.
The two leaders wanted to slim down a bloated political apparatus autonomous administration and reduce the estate tax and darovací.
The details of the negotiations for the office will be placing Masova address within the PP Jordi Cornet Dolors and Montserrat.
Masses already met Joaquinem Nadalem (PSC), which promised tough opposition Joanem Herrerou (ICV), and today we meet with Joanem Puigcercósem (ERC) Albertem Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joanem Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
Director geriatrického facilities, assures that the deaths happened as a result of a "lack of action"
The presentation of the centre of Olot exclusive that their care-giver killed more than 11 clients
Leadership geriatrického the centre of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) gave to the press conference yesterday to vylíčilo what caused the damage to the institution of criminal behaviour Joana Vily Dilmé, carers, which - mezitímco here was employed - killed at least 11 of the elderly, which had been in care.
The director of a home for the elderly Joan Sala came accompanied by a lawyer, an advocate of Joana Canady, and announced that 'wishes home La Caritat would be able to bring charges against the offender' responsible for the killing, but "the rule of law and accountability oblige us to leave this process the relevant authorities."
In addition to the damage being done to the good name of the institution, which can suffer due to the fact that, in time, revealed the criminal activities of the carers, a major threat to the home of La Caritat are now demands for material compensation, which have already calculated the legal representatives of the families pozůstalých.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime is udál in August 2009, and that since then stopped to kill
A judge has ordered exhumaci eight bodies clients home for the elderly, with the suspicion that, in many cases, the deceased neprohlížel no doctor personally, but that - given the age and poor health condition of patients - everything vyřizovalo over the phone.
La Caritat yesterday through its director of the resolutely reject the extreme and stressed that the "lack of action could be in any case, the cause of which was'.
A legal representative La Caritat add that "in case there are no indications that would be in addition to the defendant any third person made their own error '.
Now the man nicknamed 'Angel of Death' admitted yesterday 11 killing and made it clear that the first crime committed 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later killed a second stařenku.
In this case, caused by the death of Kim too high doses of insulin, unlike the first case, when he used a mixture of comforting tabletek.
The director of the La Caritat to the case said that it was difficult to control access to medikamentům staff.
Inzulín and brew sedativ were probably in six of the nine cases means that the care-giver, i.e. to killing patients in a bid to relieve their suffering.
But the analysis, which is now under way in the laboratory, should show whether the Vila don't lie and really struck for its first victims less cruel death or, on the other hand, is killed, Kim louhu, as already admitted, in the case of the three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat zdravotníkovým believes the statement, and do not rule out that the number of those killed may be higher than what is admitted and justify their behaviour in various versions, which give Vila court, with the knowledge that it must change its behavior, when it became clear that killed eight people.
That is why, they say that they want to be justice available to a whole range of this matter was osvětlen.
The European Central Bank is
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to yesterday's threat Trichet, the President of the European Central Bank, which warned that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react '.
Peripheral diferenciály are closed and shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the capacity of the European Central Bank to err, the euro has risen above the critical value.
This happened yesterday, is typical of the illiquid market which, although there is a downturn, is recovering - but thanks to a short and very speculative positions.
The investor will take some time before they lose their concerns.
A month ago, the European Central Bank today quoted to take back the level of liquidity, and tomorrow, we will have to have the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank has called for an end to the plan to buy government debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all the extraordinary levels of liquidity in the deadline and unrestricted access to leave after only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the level of liquidity 'forecasts at least until March' and keep the three-month licitaci with unlimited access to the end of the trimesters, so as to guarantee the liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that it will continue its programme of buying bonds and that even announce its intensification.
Nenaplní-li created expectations will again response from the markets yesterday, and will continue to blindly continue pulling level of liquidity, God with us!
It was the same at the congress in May, where he claimed that neither neuvažovali on the purchase of bonds, and there has been a collapse of the markets - tomorrow could history repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May it announced pancéřová fist on Monday, and on Wednesday said that they had already bought much, thereby setting off further collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auctioning gates směnek to one year in Portugal was very poor.
EL Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5,28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell about 30 points lower, odrážejíce so change of mood in the market, which occurred after Trichet said.
In Ireland was published figures represent a loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
Estimated amounts are roughly 10,000 million in short-term securities and other potential 15.000, in February, have a chance to become private equity, otherwise they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility in July, after it did not uncover the problem from tests, the amounts are in the framework of the plan and helpful acceptable and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday he will need the government to get the approval of the new Parliament and still does not have enough support to remain in Ireland, so there is uncertainty.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of his speech to release tension in the face for the next meeting of EU leaders to be held on 14 December, at which it is necessary to reach a political compromise that would have shown that the Union and we are all in the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would rather Beethovenovu wrote an Ode to Joy.
In Spain, Prime Minister yesterday had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved at the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous areas and financial institutions, reducing the deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to boost employment - into uší investors that sounds like a four seasons from Vivaldiho.
Double effect Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market rose by 4.5%, which is double than other European exchanges.
Unlike February was the reaction of the government and the national banks fast and convincing - perhaps we are benefiting from the effect of surprises.
Today, we have the key licitaci bond for three years, which will effect Trichet, due to the advantage which, we hope, will be a big demand for it, which will help to dispel the doubts about our ability to refinance.
Ask for a rescue plan would be for Spain self-sacrifice.
Give us the cash that we do not need - in El Tesoro is available to 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March, as well as high rates and access to markets, we closed the sine die.
However, it is important to continue to use the strategy Cesarovy women - 'not to be, but also by zdáti'.
We can do it.

Viceprezidentka Spanish HP Helena Herrerová said as an example of the newly přestavěnou ticket to Barcelona gran Vía Pont Reyes, belonging to the company, which is working with HP already 30 years.
The North American company přichystala plan for the establishment of a 200 sales jobs in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The shops were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), trade in Barcelona is the third.
Herrerová did not want to reveal where the other shops will be open, however, acknowledged that Madrid could be one of the sites.
Herrerová, which is also personnel systems, HP sure that philosophy opening shops will still be the same - using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here with an exclusive styling equipment shops (with products that it is possible to test interaktivně), which in Europe will be identical.

Trade in Barcelona is part of a pilot programme pionýrského at a global level, which aims to tackle any problems with the computer devices in the guarantee.
The online service is connected with technical centre located in Maastricht (the Netherlands).

Sabadell betting on the fact that the 'who has stolen "during the three years of its competitors million clients
More optimistic than other bosses delegovaný member of the board of the bank, Banco Sabadell Jaime Guardiola, believe that 2011 will be a difficult year for the bank, but refuses to a new liquidity crisis and predicts passive the end of the war.
Yet this reduction in interest rates, but they will try to compensate for slevněním bank fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell, it is expected that he will be able to during the three years to get a million private clients.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years, and it can survive in the tough economic conditions.
In 2011 the bank will trigger a new strategic plan in effect for three years.
The aim is in addition to survive without recourse to public assistance in FROB gain market share podchycením million new private clients - or 700.000 odečtou-li, with those who will be leaving or bank - because until now ai institution rather hýčkal small and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises than retail clients.
This year has already acquired bank 250.000 private clients and 50.000 businesses.
Its share of the market is, when it comes to private clients 3.5%, while for corporate zákazníku this is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 is a commitment to the productivity, or can also attain say, in order to reduce costs, which will show the challenges the bank, when it will present the results of the period.
Few banking institutions in this time of dare to set targets and to publish them because of the financial crisis has changed all of the plans of the global banking sector.
Sabadell this year, closing its programme of Optima, established four years ago, even though it was originally for three years, but the situation on the markets require extending for another term.
Clients, who will leave from the savings will be their main target group.
At a meeting convened by APIE Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a difficult and "very important".
Indeed, I think that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy."
In addition, it will be in two or three years' very difficult to create employment ", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, it added.
And although believes that passive war - which reduces margins - away, the price for the risk that přirážek banks and savings banks to pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity has already shifted in the price of credit, which is being compensated by a reduction in the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural and will be pressure on the loans' factor.
"We have been able to conclude a tap, but diferenciály are very high," Guardiola has acknowledged.
Banesto already issued its network on Thursday orders to reduce long-term loans and increased prices diferenciálů - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
Also recognised that the trends in banking 'it is now cutting commissions', but there is the framework of the 'competitive'.
The strategic plan banks Sabadell is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
Not for nothing did he assures that, in Spain "will demand greater size".
"Next year will be stone unturned" to reassure.
Confirms that the needs of the capital are "much reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institutions comes between the red numbers.
And she points out that, FROB can replace the collection of funds in the market before the new measure of capital.
After assurances that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, remains a serious problem of what some bankers predict as new liquidity crisis.
It notes that there is no issue, but, in contrast to what it was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term financing through the repo rates, which lessens the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers &
CEO CECA refused yesterday that should be another wave of mergers &, and once again insisted on the speed with which it is being carried out by the reorganisation of the sector.
When the association started the process of the Spanish savings, are a few of the institutions that assured that this first phase of the ceremonies and will wait for the second round.
However, the Director General of the Confederation of savings (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta ruled yesterday that should rise to a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that the majority of the merger has already been carried out, inkorporaci Cajasolu into the Banca Cívica cannot be considered the second round, this is happening, the conventions are '.
"The majority is fully implemented, it is possible that, instead of 17 institutions will go to 13 or 14, but all the major trials are already finished and under the protection of the national bank, which in this matter has been working very well," said the director.
In his statements at a meeting of the Association of the ADEA (and executive officers Aragonu - which depicted Olavarrieta that the concentration of the process is "the highest possible speed and we have to be very pleased, as exhibits in instalments, which at the time, not now emerged in commercial plans are Španělskou National Bank," pointed out.
'Move from 45 savings, with an average amount of assets 28.000 million at 17 with 75.500 millions of is a process that is unprecedented in the history of comparison, redukujíce so the number of institutions on 62%, so that these were larger, and thus, in accordance with the Treaty of Basel II, "underline that point.
Olavarrieta recognised that "there are a lot of not so happy about the slowness of the process," which shows a lack of understanding on the part of 'and' because 'what does the Spanish National Bank is a memorial to the fact that we have to be before the end of the year in the term'.
CEO CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday that Spain has the highest financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and to those who question awarded 'lack of knowledge. "
The director said that in the current favourable economic situation "can be assured" on the financial institutions and savings, as well as a system that has sufficient resources' very important 'process' concentration and which is the highest possible speed. "
Also remind you that the Spanish banking it became very well from stress-causing tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and red German lines
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tension on markets provoked double the government's response.
On the one hand, he suggested José Luis Zapatero new adaptation measures, from tax reductions for small and medium-sized businesses, despite the regulation of private zprostředkovacích agencies or the abolition of the 426 the euro without benefits for the unemployed, up to 49% of the privatisation (AENA Spanish airports and air traffic control - which.), Barajas airport manager and El Prat and 30% of the national lottery.
Vice-President Elena Salgadová with the support of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined the critiques about Chancellor Angela Merkel because of its responsibility for initiating the current crisis.
How to interpret these feelings?
Well in advance, said that Merkel is not the fault of the position in its communications policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefinice the euro.
And Germany has radically new vision of what it is to be his future, which runs on the idea of respect for the old traditions, which is a big part of the other members.
In the face of European opposition in Germany begins to speculate about the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is the strength of the euro area, which would be part of it, but also, for example, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, while southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the deutsche mark - although now it may seem, scifi this version has broad public support, the approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to the German proposals recast the euro with greater macroeconomic surveillance, budgetary severity, the penalties for guilty States, possible delay payments for some of them, and with the extension of the possible cost of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and already some time, defines so there is no room for evasion by now.
First of all, when in 2009, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission had encouraged deficits, has pulled out of the basement of the German government to reform, in order to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of conflict between what it considered Germany for the right (plans for fiscal stringency and the stability of public finances), and thus what praktikovali its European partners, including France.
The second showed the Central European country, when Merkel painfully protahovala decisions about the rescue of Greece.
Already has been the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, have been strongly opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October's Merkel once again come to the fore, with a clear point of view when he called for the reform of the European Union to allow the bailout of any member state, and at the same time, to have a private creditors to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because accelerate the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, though in a somewhat zmírněné form was agreed, and over the next few months should monitor the reform process of the Union, which would from 2013 enable these measures.
Germany took the red line, which is not going to go.
And everyone tells us that, although it is now to be done, which apparently too, from this date will be the end of the old workings of the euro.
2013 will represent the birth of a new currency zone in which states that violate rules sankcionovány hard and may be forced to announce a postponement of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to give a firm path of growth to an increase in the level of savings and investments, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Choice based on claims was and building, with vast gaps in the balance of payments, which governed in the boom years, the growth of Spain, simply will not tolerate.
Supply is clear.
And we would be making a mistake if we understood this.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we want, it is much harder.
And the worst of it is that under these circumstances, we might ourselves zmýlíme.
I hope that they will replace the current turbulence more calm.
And that will give us the opportunity to spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood and his dual statements (reforms promised after meeting with large businesses from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of the new measures), it suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel to open the way to the idea that there is a need to put things in order.
But red lines set by Germany, is here, and it does not appear that it would like to move.
And of the possibilities, which can be considered to be leaving the euro area full of little serious countries ruled out.
Now, Germany will always be able to say that we have been warned.
Sport and the circumvention of the rules
Finty, which showed Alonso and Ramos in the match with Ajaxem, show ingenuity rather than the intention to escape death.
Supposedly contrived non-exclusion two players real Madrid (Xabiho Alonsa and Sergio Ramos) in the match against the League champions Ajaxu from 23 November has caused that it was written about whether Sea inkoustu this is or is not, and whether the behavior of nesportovní eventuelně UEFA had both footballers to punish.
As is well known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly vyhraný) appointed players after the second one intentionally losing time when should play so sudího faul was instigated by them, and he has shown a second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the requisite sentence in the next match against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end in their group in the forefront - and deprived of the cards will be able to go to the next stage.
By the end of the disciplinary commission UEFA trenéru José Mourinhovi punishment to two games and provinilí players received monetary fine.
Provoking the yellow card for similar conditions is not a new practice, but it is more or less normal in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, the rules that are, but we are watching.
Part of the debate in this case arose due to the fact that it was part of the Real Madrid team (which is in its anthem boast šlechetností and honors, and which has a similar actions of their players pokutoval) and, it seems, also thanks to dramatizaci led Mourinhem, which so adds to its long history, buffoon and provokatéra another episode.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of action, which is not the rules explicitly banned, is in conflict with the principles of the sport, whether in these deeds to circumvent the law; it is, in fact, the actions that respect the rules of the sport, whose sense, however, it seems, is trying to wriggle out of.
With what type of damage such negotiations are Sport spirit.
One of the details of the sporting behaviour is physical integrity protihráčů, which was not in breach of these cases, there was a violent game.
Another of these details characterise the clean game is avoiding players through their offence should be to the advantage of the other team - which also did not happen.
So the irony of the action of players real Madrid is the fact that this did not happen, what normally charakterizujeme as trick or circumvent the law, there is no such breach of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this should be the most visible, with the aim of the death to receive.
And like to wait for death.
Another question, however, is what the culprits advantage of its deliberate offence will have.
Here it is necessary to say that is not the position of a rival to the disadvantaged, and that, in the current struggle falls short of any benefit, as the obvious implication is that the team will have fewer players.
And even this is not a useful strategy to another struggle, because the club will not be able to count on these players.
Apparently, the advantage lies in the fact that the players will begin the next phase of the League champions without cards, which could jeopardise their participation in the future of the game.
But it is to the advantage of the long-term perspective and with some degree of neurčitosti, at first glance, to be a team eliminated, and beyond that in this negotiations the odbudou players the death, and the switch in the second round, in which the card to the exclusion of just one card less than in the first round.
So how will the wheels continue, will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the spirit of Sport, which is to make the strategic decisions that will enable us to obtain the maximum benefit in the framework of the rules.
In the event that we are dealing with here, not players for the aim of avoiding the death (which would be a clear case of circumventing the rules), but rather choose, when he faced.
Make strategic decisions without avoid death or they him.
Although it is the line between wit and bypassing the rules clear, I believe that in this case, it was a savvy.
It seems to me that the controversy arises from two reasons: Because it was about two samovyloučení and because of the way it was with the instructions to transfer their provoking from the leadership.
Damage to the sporting principles of these actions is so ethical as aesthetic.
The offers on the Christmas parties in Barcelona
Diktat calendar, concentrated this year, a spate of reserves on 16 and 17 December.
There are celebrations quickly paid by employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 of the euro.
As well as the Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of the December once again come pre-Christmas street parties, which still operates as a kyslíková bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but the crisis has resulted in the fight to win customers by cutting prices: Almost everyone wants to spend on food, 20 to 30 of the euro agree dotázaní entrepreneurs and associations from this sector.
To complete the numbers of complications, zkoncentroval calendar this year (when on Christmas Day was on Friday) applications for a week since 13 December, there was a flurry of reserves for days on top of the (16 and 17.), while in the previous week was almost no traffic.
As has happened since the start of 2008, when the meagre years, many of the firms that collective street parties abolished for budgetary reasons.
That did not abandon tradition, many employees, is counting on a cocktail of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demanding prices on the verge of viability, says the president of the association of restaurants Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
Representative patronátu restaurant facilities at this point does not dare to predict what will be celebrations this month.
"People do it well, than do the book. '
"They want to, but when it comes to the subject of prices, are careful," he adds.
Those deals will go well, "who would offer quality and good service at a favourable price," he says, and suggests that, as a result of the crisis have customers tend to be a degree of mines and most zákazníku now wants to spend around 25 euros.
A survey in the various facilities shows that the greatest strain of requests for book is on the evening of December 17.
The group espouses a real boom Soteras reservations on Friday, with most of the requirements is to spend to 30 euro, which offered to adapt's menu, whose overall prices are from 25 to 30 euros.
In other major companies which is Andilana, numbering 16 facilities in the city (the Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and other) brought a peculiarity of the calendar more early booking and this from the beginning of November.
"We have done the impossible possible, in order to keep prices from last year, and our taste of the menu, from which they had to choose one, moving from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In An Grup group, which includes El Mussol, Attic QuQu, and a total of 23 companies remain optimistic, having seen since the second half of the year, an increase in profits and have relatively solid prospects for the Christmas sales.
The sources point out that this society also 18 December will vytíženým day, as will take place pre-Christmas celebrations among friends.
To add to their six group's menu's menu on Christmas, with a budget of 30 euro or more, as seen in comparison with the previous year, the guests tend to spend about 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (the Spanish šumivé wine - which.).
Note also that some firms that once again zvou their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is a little bit more.
Vicepresident society Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of bars, restaurants and leisure centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believe that is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, and says that the number of reservations "revived" although clients' bargain at best. "
This impression even during the Christmas celebrations has not given in to, whether it is true, too.
Pakistan's nuclear program has produced a great deal of unrest in the U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons' at a faster rate than any other country ".
Wikileaks documents show links between talibánci and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the Embassy of the United States in Pakistan and the US Foreign Ministry published the portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous discomfort in Washington, which is Pakistan's nuclear program.
Alongside objasňujících and important details that offer on the content of the communications and ideas of Representatives North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries, when it comes to nuclear security, rather than to increase, 'is on the wane, "and that this unstable Asian countries' produces more nuclear weapons than any other state."
Peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that its weapons are not smontovány store, but after the components to be znesnadněna their destruction in the case of the attack - is one of the main reasons for the vigilance of Washington.
This lists ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Pattersonová in one report ahead of a visit by the then national security adviser, James Jones, said: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged led to the spread of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
An increase in the number of people connected with the nuclear arsenály and cruise missile programme is already pozorován only the US, but also in Russia, such as the widening and a reason to be wary.
"Pakistan had to protect nuclear facilities to recruit staff with strict religious faith; given the decline in the level of education and culture have extremist organisations more opportunities to recruit people who will be working in nuclear programmes or programmes cruise missiles," said Yuri Korolev expert from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a meeting with their counterparts from the US.
The biggest new documents published by Juliana Assangeho is increasingly less cooperation between the US and Pakistan issues in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and increased the pace of the production of these weapons.
Ambasádou cables published in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as a "frustrating," saying: "There is often no transparency; offers of assistance remain unchallenged or rejected."
In another report, notes Peter Lavoy worker national intelligence services for South Asia that "despite the economic disaster produces Pakistan nuclear weapons as quickly as they have no other country in the world".
Ambassador Pettersonová also is asking Washington to during a visit by the head of the army General Ashfaqa Kayaniho, 'very well, "explained that" Pakistan's army must stop with the quiet support of terrorist groups ".
A hunt for the head of the Wikileaks
Obama will appoint senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, to avoid the new tax evasion information.
Interpol has issued a red 'challenge' to track down and identify where Assange could be.
Everything on the WikiLeaks and its founder, Juliana Assangeho are complicated maze, where it is difficult to be sure the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday 'emergency call', 'Red notice,' and 'Assangeho lokalizování monitoring of the movement.
But it is not a classic order for the detention.
In addition, this call is not new, but the dates on 20 November.
And has nothing to do with the last of more than a quarter of a million of the diplomatic documents, but with allegations of sexual abuse, which faces Australan in Sweden.
In addition, assures the legal representative of the inventor of the Wikileaks Mark Stephens' police knows where and how to contact with Mr Assangem '.
It was the 20th of November, when the international police force, based in the French Lyon issued the order at the request of the Swedish it been kept secret, but, until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
For this situation has 188 countries Interpol guidelines for identification or location Assangeho 'to impose on him a temporary link and follow him. "
Although Interpol can order the arrest of people, which relates to the red challenge many of the Member States, as the organisation explained, however, consider the so-called Red notice for allowing the arrest carried out - it must be ensured the national component of the police - especially in cases where countries are mutual agreement on the issue of detainees, as is the case in the case of Sweden and England, where it probably had Assange to find.
This step pohoršil Assengeho attorneys, who yesterday published writing, which claim that the founder of the WikiLeaks devětatřicetiletý willingness to answer questions the Swedish authorities through video conferencing.
Recall, too, that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from of his case, which compare with legendárním Lavrentijem Pavlovičem Berijou, head of Stalin's security.
'This is the hunt and not legal persecution, "the letter states.
While it is looking for the rest of the world - and from Australia his mother defends her son's innocence - Assange is increasingly in an unknown place, but nemlčí.
On Monday provided through with Skype from unknown places šéfredaktorovi Time magazine interview - in this interview has resigned, the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If that was responsible for the behest of the US diplomats to engage in espionage in the UN, and so were the international conventions, which have signed up to the United States, should resign," he said.
His view was yesterday rejected by the White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbsem that kvalifikoval request demise as a "ridiculous and absurd".
"I am not sure why you should care about the opinion, which operates the individuals such Web site," he said on CNN.
Obama himself has appointed senior member of staff responsible for the fight against terrorism, Rusella Traverse to stop another evasion documents.
The spokesman, President Barack Obama to stop adding Assangemu in stark contrast with the views on the importance of that in these days are conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, a member of Congress since January, which will be in the chair of the Committee on national security in the House of Commons, asked the State Department to look into the possibility of including Wikileaks between the terrorist organisation, "in order to be able to intervene and prosecute anyone who would assist them financially or otherwise provide assistance".
Further went that Flanagan, an adviser to the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, there who said that Assange should 'be killed, "which, in turn, had to appeal to.
"Obama would have to call it a reward or use bezpilotní plane or something like that."
Who did was Mike Huckabee, a former priest, baptistický guvernátor Arkansasu and possible candidate for president.
"Whoever is in government, who is responsible for the release of information, the betrayal and any other punishment than the execution would be too lenient," he declared at the station Fox
Puigcercós is looking for in the ERC calm 'pomrkáváním' supporters Caroda
The Republican leader to the side of the secret vote on its remaining.
Huguet proposes more plurální executive and after schůzovního system.
Joan Puigcercós probably find a recipe, as already několikátou internal fight with a rebellion in the ranks of the Left of Catalonia (ERC the Republican Party - which bezvýslednou.), because of the loss of 11 members, and half of the votes.
The chairman of the party is aware that his gesture on the demise of the former leader of his supporters seem to Josep Lluíse Caroda-Roviry insufficient, and also knows that the impact of the sector is now so weakened himself as its leader, and that he absolutely cannot do such concerns, what with other zaniklými currents.
That is why it will be the leader of the Left to gain new criticism by pomrkávání, which will help shield in municipal elections.
First Puigcercós yesterday announced that more than 200 members of the national committee, will be able to speak to his staying in office.
With ballot papers, not catch the eye.
If they want to give the supporters Caroda chairman of a voice, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, it wants to avoid the head of the division and the subjugation of its people.
In several conversations, argued that it would not consider endorsed by half of the votes, and one, moreover, he added, but, without percent sure that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria."
Supporters Caroda demand after the President more than to give my office available - which see it as a gesture that has no weight since Puigcercós sjezdech controls on the body.
But, given that they do not have sufficient majority to be able to enforce demise, will seek to remind the executive plan from now until May.
To expect that they will participate in the drafting of the document on the strategic reorientaci, which can lead to the National Council of the day in 18 months.
Their aim is to encourage Puigcercóse it, in exchange for the promise of Congress in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that 'mnohohlasnost' harms stability, and that his aim is to once and for all, the organization has been able to launder their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it seems to be symptomatic of the article, which the current advisor to Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Then, as soon as he took into account the Puigcercósův ideologue, this adviser for innovation took a fait accompli that the leader will be confirmed, "in exchange for a few goals.
And those appointed five, two stand out.
The first is the 'překomponování' executive, so that was at least 90% of its members, which means also include the new faces who are friendly Carodovi from the sector.
The second target may be big news.
Huguet proposes to ERC completely end schůzovnictvím as a mechanism of the operation.
And so is fighting for reform of the constitution to be held kongresy delegates selected through the vote.
Model schůzovního to put an end to the opt-out system in the Spanish system of political parties, it is intended to Puigcercósova team, which, in this direction has already fought on two recent sjezdech.
However, křečovité Assembly in 2008 decided that schůzovnictví must be considered at a special congress on reforming the constitution.
This matter is still nevyřízená, as the situation inside the discouraged from the solution to this issue.
Now, without číhajících critical sectors, would be a good time to address this issue and to try and close it once and for all.

The second round of the cycle pleasure of language was promenádou, where participants showed gala presentation of the literary
'Sex in a language I understand, but... a finger into the wounds? What awaits me?, "asked the novelist Luisa Valenzuelová, which was invited to start the second round of the delights of the language of the cycle, which is celebrating the literature written in the Spanish language, and whose question was used on this occasion as podtitulek (on another Fair the table have devoted to the subject of sex in a language to explain).

Since leaving infektologa convinced: "Patience is not my strong suit, this may be my morning '.
Eventually, after frustration with traumatologem, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explain that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst, which will reveal the secrets of this morning: "This represents a truly rozevřené and it is a symbolic jizva '.
Protagonistka odlehčeně povzdychla, and concluded that 'the clots, she managed to learn much that is what is really rozevřeným and that there is no', but took the belief that pleasure and pitfalls in language must go hand in hand.

He said that, in the world, who lives in a hurry, also in intellectual habits and control, which is, forgotten dogmatismy, 'that for every přitakáním is small and not for every denies it is also small yes'.
'We were masters of our ideas and reality: Přibarvovat přibarvovat means many times and put a finger to the wounds and bother those individuals who are much more convenient, because they think in karikaturách, černobíle in fixed ideas and without colouring, and also to show authority, that this a black and white world, "he said, to encourage the sense of writing.

Illegal migration will be able to continue without any problems.
Bill Conservatives who would, according to the government should regulate the problem of ships loaded illegal immigrants will obviously přemožen, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday knowing that they cannot support it.
"To a significant extent the Charter I am. '
"I stand on the side of the party, which has built up žulu under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, leader of the Liberals after týdenním surrounded by members of the du weekly caucus.
Liberals have insisted that the bill, as is the proposed law, which would allow any person to hold up to one year from the ship, identified as boat carrying illegal immigrants would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the bloc, Gilles Duceppe quebeckého, also said that he could not support the bill, because it is going to the wrong target.
"We are against, and it seems that all the opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," said M. Duceppe.
Kritička NPD have been in question, on the issue of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism, who want to make her party has not been strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.

The new unity is not unanimity
Despite the announcement, on the possible creation of a permanent troops for the fight against corruption and koluzi, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public commission for the issue.
The minister for public security, Robert Dutil, seeks to this idea nezapadla into oblivion: Québec does with the Department of Investigation in New York, consult this issue back in January of next year.
Cities are available to permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Therefore úterní announcement nejednoho of us by surprise.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Permanent Partnership Council for the police service in Quebeku 29 October of last year, this was not to be discussed measures, despite the fact that he was also present himself Robert Dutil.
It was more of a need for a critic of public safety, straník PQ Stéphane Bergeron, evaluate this announcement as' králíka vytaženého of the hat 'and' amateur solution zfušované on koleně '.
The minister himself Dutil answer to those who fear that the political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"Along with the confirmation of: You can see the result, when it means."
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president, CSQ Réjeana Parenta, nothing can replace the interrogation of witnesses in a public trial.
"Moreover, Mr Charest ensures that it does not want to create this investigative commission, and people think, as you and I do, that something is," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of a commission of inquiry, is the demise of Jean Charesta," explains on the matter Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and conducted by the Constitution for education in high government officials.
In order to be able to come out of this impasse, suggested Quebeku to grant special mandate to investigate the inspektorovi koluzi and corruption.
"We need to be able to extend the mandate of the EDPS ', decided.
It is also for the fact that the Quebec could give inspektorovi the same powers as Commissioner, which allow people to force gave evidence.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in writings Charestovy government.
Quebec also after Ottawa to change criminal code, so that was a better primed for this type of crime.
This requirement would resulted from Data operation Marteau (a hammer), which reported that the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that the case for this type of inquiry is explicit.
The federal minister for public security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, has deals with some amendments associated with this document.
In the spring of 2001, which hit the bikerů, although the criminal code has not yet regulated, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa then left to make the changes in the law on gangsterství.

Dupont is partly blamoval
Quebecký radio host at Stéphane Dupont is split failure suffered from the Canadian Council for standard radio and television broadcasting (RRTV) because of controversial statements on social assistance and Haitians and, as well as due to gross expression during the broadcast.
The radio and TV broadcasts that Mr Dupont is and his group from CHOI 98,1 FM had a right to express their views, but some of the statements were "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portray Haitians gross expression that does not correspond to the broadcasting vysílanému 'during the day.
The Council also concluded that the debate on suicide, including posting the names of the two people who have taken out life neporušily regulations for radio broadcasts.
The Council for radio and television broadcasting has received a number of complaints relating to comments made during the broadcast, posted between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after complaints of the Common Front Quebeku recipients of social support.
The group complained that the amounts listed in broadcasting, were inaccurate.
Moderátoři must submit a reliable information, not false.
When it comes to suicide, an interlocutor Stéphane Dupont is thought that suicide is a gesture of despair.
The majority of the members of the Commission concluded that transmitted the report was that suicide can be seen as the solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The Commission believes that the most contentious episodes of broadcasting 'Dupontových poledních reports' hit on the delicate subject of an impartial and appropriate manner."
It was to him raised any výtka.
The latest dispute about the statements that followed after the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont is Jean-René Dufort and therefore gave to the media a shootout, which has produced many of the responses.
An interlocutor CHOI said that no send a gift to help Haitians because we cannot know for sure that I really needed to get the money.
The Commission believes that these comments were unjustified, but their cumulative effect creates unduly negative image of Haitians.
"I have my repair a three-day suspension of the things'.
'My sheets is intact for one year and a half, "said an interlocutor.
In all of the decisions of the Commission refuses to use in broadcasting crude expression.
In any case, the radio broadcasts CHOI-FM cooperation "beyond their duties'.
For the station, which will have to, among other things, to announce the decision twice during the main broadcasting within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuvà Montreal.
The population of Montreal, originally from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal is extremely special doběh.
An athlete who excels in the 'sandě' (kung-fu 'full contact ') kickboxu and Thai boxing is on the tatami and ringy around the world and is looking for new challenges.
"I began with combat uměními as the kung-fu and kickbox 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal nymí, who lived in the city since 2008, he taught at the professionals'.
"In my case, I am looking for the matches so a little bit of everywhere, because for those who do not like the game in the country, which appears in the combat sports competition, are rare in North America."
Recently this man, who works as a ochranka pomocník and as for company UPS just add their rivals bad news, when he won two gold medals at the World Cup in the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburgu, in Scotland.
"I won the category kickboxu full contact and Thai boxing," he said.
"At the present time, I am preparing to China for the World Cup in San shou. '
'Have been invited rivals, who ended the first four at the last World Cup in every category.'
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze.

"Interestingly, in every competition have achieved some progress'.
"At this rate, I will be the first this year or next year! '
'San shou' or 'sanda' discipline is coming from China, where strikes are iron and feet, as well as on the ground, dragging.
Games have traditionally taking place on the Plateau and rarely in the ring.
Most famous boxer, resulting from this form of the fight, it is the American Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.

450 nasmlouvaných million without invitations
Hydro-Québec agreed by mutual agreement 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering hydroelektrický Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert on the project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 of the contracts, it is made up of a consortium of firms BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and the Axor, which have gained the most important contract, contract to manage the whole project in a total of 295 million dollars, without a public competition.
This Énergie gérance on behalf of a consortium, was in 2004 zplnomocněno in parallel with the selection of companies Hydro-Québec to svěřilo to the private sector of their responsibility for the management of this important hydroelektrického the project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005 'consortium Énergie gérance' inspiured lucrative contract without any declaration of a public competition.
For Quebeckou party complaint to a consortium of businesses before us is a serious problem of ethical character, which runs the exclusion of competition and rising prices.
"This is a new way to implement koluzi and destroy competition."
"This means that people are already doing deals in secret, now do it openly," he said yesterday, a member of the PQ Sylvain Simard at a press conference.
A little earlier this morning, M. Simard the National Assembly to ask this question because, he says, is how hard it can be sold to the public interest in this way.
The minister for natural resources, Nathalie Normandeau afternoon, argue forcefully popírajíc that it was in this contract on koluzi.
"I had my own way," hromovala and claimed that PQ was "dishonest" and "lack of rigour".
She said that "this would be the smallest 'that PQ apologised.
A recipe for creating a consortium is common practice throughout the world.
It is usually an alliance, limited in time, which will allow the two companies to tie or a few of their mutual expertisy to be able to respond to the invitation to tender for the complex project.
Eastmain is a very complicated project with a view to obsáhlost work.
Construction already is running out and must be rozvržena in 2012.
However, the treaty has been granted without competition could act; it was a trade.
Also, it must be acknowledged that formulka consortia in Quebeku is no longer the exception, and even for the relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week Le Devoir, formulka consortia in advising in engineeringu is the subject of an investigation in the government.
Přelétneme-li in the speed of commercial register quebeckých firms, this will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, while some seem to be created permanent.
Dessau this company works in partnership with the majority of its major competitors; to CIMA + Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the legal one and the same person, and that is the Dessau.
If it comes to a consortium Énergie gérance Minister Normandeauová, in particular, has highlighted the fact that the 'territory la the Baie James is typical special dynamism of the labor force, and that the Hydro-Québec has responded to since the 1970s ".
The patron saint of the project Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from energy companies the Baie James (SEBJ), an explanation that will compel us svraštit front over the fact that the treaty on the management of the project has been reached by mutual agreement.
'If jdeš to public competition and, if it is too little competition, making participants offer your offered prices may be higher. "
"You have a choice of two options: I.e. that sebereš the people who appear in the tender as participants in the competition, and that řekneš: 'Let us conclude a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the main idea is that the price is not important, but the remit of the people," Mr Laporte has confirmed.
This Treaty granted to the consortium Énergie gérance is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000, which received Quebeku Party.
Contracts have been closed to companies on a project or Hydro-Québec SEBJ Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
After verification Le Devoir 109 contracts can count on the advice of the field closed engineeringu year between 2002 and March 2010 with the companies or their branches, especially with the Dr. suggested, analysis of samples of the soil.
SNC-Lavalin shrábl 22 contracts, Génivar of them received 16, 14 and 10 Tecsult Dessau, without should share in the 'Énergie gérance'.
All contracts were closed.
Together account for 449 783 $344, including contract companies Énergie gérance to 295 131 $564.
Sylvain Simard, he indicated that the four firms, which are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM) and the Axor are 'very good' Quebeku known of the Liberal Party.
Minister Normandeauová delete the message that PQ is also linked to the firms that "finance", before specify that this is more about its executives.
The barometer of responsible consumption - 'green' on the label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly sceptical.
Quebecký consumer trust the very few players to sustainable development, but also 'impartial' marks and environmental certification, that this led to the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even when koupeme in the media space, which urges and calls on us to the socially responsible consumption, cries the media space over a lack of credible information, a failure to act, even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, says Baromètre responsible consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although in 2010 increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products Quebeku, the people who are trying to sell them, yet too believes
Two thirds of us, in fact, they say, because they do not trust the promises of the firms on the environment, simply because the green advertising companies, ascertains measuring instrument, which was drawn up by the University of Sherbrooke Observatory responsible consumption.
Other findings: Half of all consumers have doubts about the credibility of the official certification přikládaných on the so-called fair products, but it is also about the credibility of the products and brands, which are supposed to be environmentally responsible, says Barometre.
In the same way as politicians debate on this subject is taken as a serious user-taxpayers Quebeku 14.6% of the population.
Information about responsible consumption appears to be the first, however, to stimulate consumption of the site as well as renewed currently quebeckých almost a third of the consumer.
Indeed, a vacuum and dubious nature of the information would make the enthusiasm of the 46% of consumers.
This is the second a brake, which identified Baromètre, after higher prices for these products.
After all, a third of the population are from Quebekuse to the reported data on products or 'green' services, which we are looking for is to be left to go through our hands.
On the other hand, in the year 2010, it was almost half of consumers willing to change their habits and particularly to change the brand of one or a few of the products, thereby respond to their beliefs.
As many as 61% of them favoring purchases for traders from their neighborhoods and prefer buying food, planted with in their region, says Baromètre.
More 'green' and responsible - responsible consumption index is up 64 of the maximum 100 for this year - Homo consumus Québeku to present itself as the king of recycling, which seeks to what the smallest impact on the environment by cares about animal protection.
But their social and ecological conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, says Baromètre: In 2010, barely 28% of the population Quebeku said that the use of public transport or recommend the use of the cars on the train at least two people, in the interests of the protection of nature.
Walking round and also supported on 39,1% of the participants in this wide-ranging survey behavior, who used this cliché.
State loan to buy complex cinemas eXcentris
Government Quebeku that we have asked for financial participation to buy complex cinemas eXcentris Angus Community et le Parallèle, agrees with the part, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Developperská society 'Angus et le Parallèle', which focus on the gift of seven million dollars from the Minister of Culture in the redemption of cinematic complex on the tabloids Saint-Laurenta, which has shown its mission as milovníka film art, did not get what it wanted.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the dossier, but on its own terms.
Rather than the desired gift Quebeku Government is proposing a loan, which would be lower, some was the original expectations that could build the foundation for a viable solution for favourable conditions and resources coming from the state.
The first plan of action and the requirement to 12.8 million has already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, but applications have already been revised to reduce.
A draft plan of action and sent Minister St-Pierre Society president for business development in culture (SODEC), François Macerola kinematografický eXcentris, which runs the project.
The final report has been sent to the ten days ago.
But protinávrh government came into society SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallèle et Angus have time until 31 December to respond.
However, it appears that the hypothesis gift from the law really must be rejected.
Let us remember that, of the Association of cinemas and Cinematic Arts centres in Quebeku, was set against direct investment law, in order to promote redemption eXcentrisu usuzujíc, the culture minister, that it does not have to fund the project on the properties, although it has done for other kinosály.
But several of the participants in the debate on the crucial dožadovalo economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, has a room of its cinemas during the 10 years of the art of film, after he funded the construction of the complex, which could be a reason for the revision of financial advice on the part of the state.
The lack of room for independent films is gaudy in Montréalu eXcentris, and could have to obtain a permanent clientele.
Company Angus et le Parallèle, with Christianem Yaccarini in my head, it follows a campaign for the release of the funds in the private sector, in the belief that utrží 700 000 $protlačení for acquisitions.
In the spring of 2009, the only one of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues in the distribution of films for eXcentris.
The aim is to open the future nabyvatelů again all three rooms on 27 February of next year, and to show the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Muži and minor gods.
But Christian Yaccarini not made any reference to the Le Devoir and he ignores, with his group thinks about the proposals for the reduction, which are made to him.
Zvednutá Curtain in Canada as a whole...
The new diplomatic sources in the US became known by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regarded as Canadians inferiority complex against the Americans, but the same whiplash reveal their sense of superiority last appointed to Canada.
American diplomats are wondering why that each kanadskému voters lies at the heart of the kanadsko-americké relations when it comes to vote, and believes that a visit by President Obama to help a Conservative government to its budget was adopted in 2009!
Four new report which were American ambasádou in Ottawa and Washington, to the public yesterday to sheer provide sensitive details, in addition to other got under the skin. "
Communication with the date of 22 September 2008, in the midst of an election campaign, specify at what point the United States is not part of the betting, which discussed the political leaders.
To the surprise of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkinse.
Mr Wilkins provides some explanations to this situation.
"The Canadian inferiority complex, almost utkvělý, makes perhaps the political leaders to speak about internal betting instead to realise that these elections will also apply to the United States (as in the campaign to free trade in 1988)," she writes.
"The United States is a 'closed' příslovečným elephant in these elections: Ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about them."
Ambasador understand this' ohlušujícímu 'silence on less that the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or, better still, head of the party to follow these important relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls."
Another expression of this sense of the importance of this can be read in the report, which was sent on 22 January 2009, Terry Breese, Charge d'Affaires in Ottawa at Ottawa preparing President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure the preservation of the government in a confidence vote at the beginning of February, on the federal budget, which Canada publicly admits its first deficit in more than ten years, because of the recovery plan of $30 billion to $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
Nowhere no mention of the fact that the government had to postpone pre-Christmas session of Parliament that could not be defeated coalition and that the opposition parties like their survival of the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from the January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkinsem, highlights Washington on ever more negative image, which in the United States cast a dramatic series broadcast on CBC.
He is concerned about the broadcasts BMW little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which can be seen not too much subtlety of his references to the Canadian torture Arar, 'or' No-Fly-List also on the kidnapping for the purposes of violent interrogation for the CIA.
Another report typically covers about the fact that in their first bilateral meeting Hillary Clinton to ask his French partner Bernard Kouchner, whether Europe is ready to accept some of the detainees from Guantánamo Bay.
Mr Kouchner said yes, but on the basis of the principle of 'a case-by-case basis. "
At the end of the meeting, it says, 'to a paper on Omar Khadr, a Canadian 15-letého Muslim origin, the Secretary of State. "
'Secretary accepted that component reviews'.
Poznamenejme finally, that those concerned with WikiLeaks, is jumping.
The Flanagan, a former advisor to very close to the Stephen Harperovi, said waves on the CBC that the person responsible for this massive spill should be "destroyed".
Rozhlásilo it and about this and Mike Huckabee in the United States.
The plan to restore the lighting
Yesterday the UN has proposed a plan in Cancun on the recovery of the domestic lighting, lighting stores and industrial space in 100 countries, with the aim of limiting the greenhouse effect (GES), which is the equivalent of nearly one third of further restrictions, which is needed to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of big concrete projects that it wants the United Nations to push the Cancún difficult to compensate for the lack of a viable commitments to cut back on the side of the industrialised countries.
Yesterday, according to the plan, if rozžhavené light bulbs, who monopolize still 50% to 70% of the market, replacing žárovkami fluokompaktními or, even better, žárovkami with elektroluminiscentními diodami (del or 'LEDs' in English), the principal amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (GT) GES emissions on the planet created because of the lighting would odbouralo.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions from the car park on the planet.
In Copenhagen last year, the big countries with a significant share of the emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, among them Canada, involved in voluntary plans to reduce, which should enable the decline in global emissions of 53 GES GT to 49 GT.
But it will be offset against the balance sheets of even the 5 GT, to be achieved by the year 2020, stabilizing the climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius in order to be ruled out that they will not get out of control.
In 95% of the energy bulbs contain rozžhavených the rest in the form of heat and rest, i.e. 5%, it is the product of the light.
With fluokompaktními žárovkami reduces energy consumption by 75%, and with the new žárovkami with del, zredukujeme this consumption even twice.
Fluokompaktní light bulbs will, on average, from 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
New light bulbs with del, who said this week in the production of Philips - this company allegedly took part in the study of the United Nations - have envisaged the lifespan of the 25,000 hours and consume about 80% less energy than rozžhavená light bulb, which gives us a picture of the possible savings with the compensation plan, which would be aplikoval in 100 countries.
All of these new light bulbs can also work with reostaty and radiating less heat.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Some experts expressed reservations about the fluokompaktním žárovkám, because they contain mercury, and the need to filter as hazardous waste, which is still possible in developing countries unless manufacturers have established sběrny.
But, as the report says, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not fluokompaktní light bulb, but rather of thermal coal power plants, which emit a lot of mercury necessary for the production of electricity wasted in rozžhavených bulbs contain.
In the United States alone, these headquarters put into circulation 25 000 tons of mercury each year.
The report also says the detail of the profits, which would make this the international agenda each country.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which is equivalent to 3.5 coal-fired power stations, whose construction would cost 2.5 billion
The Côte d'Ivoire is impatiently awaiting the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has claimed the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the Ivory Coast following the expiration of the set deadlines.
"The Secretary-General emphasises the need for independent Electoral Commission has completed its work and immediately announced the preliminary results of the stress, the spokesman for the president of the United Nations."
'Calls on all parties in the Ivory Coast and institutions to their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the announcement of the makeshift results. "
Despite the pressures, made some foreign governments allowed the electoral commission to pass the ultimate date - Wednesday midnight - without results, published three days after Sunday's skrutiniu.
About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline President CEI in television confirmed that the Commission "continues to work 'to be able to announce the results.
On Wednesday, all over the world have challenges that CEI finally declared the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and Ouattara Alassanem a member of the opposition.
But Gbagbo camp relies on the nullification of Constitutional Council for 'misleading' vote in the north, which is administered by the former rebels of the New Army (FN) from the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N 'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in Côte d'Ivoire, confirmed that the intimidation of voters that the FN (The new army) to the north of the country, alienated the supporters, the president of the Ivory Coast to go to vote.

Clotilde Reiss case: Elysejský palace přeháněl mediation Syria
Over the last 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Deal Klotildy Reissové, young women researchers those who have been arrested in Iran for 'spying' united views in France, said diplomacy to combat readiness and to highlight the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All of this closely monitored, diplomats from the United States.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and konzultované with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
Describe how the palace Elysejský explained his strategy, while the Americans went so far that give advice on how to deal with such cases the hostages in Iran (a small group of výletníků).
Show how the French leaders sought to persuade Washington that the release of a young French was compensation against release Majida Kakavanda, under which the Iranians in France and hledaného American judiciary for illicit trafficking of material in favour of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, to a sharp světlu the way to the French presidency sought to manipulate the media to akreditovali idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad, has played a central role in the liberation of Klotildy Reissové.
In fact, it has not done anything.
Diplomatic cable drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris has the headline: "Iran: The French comments on how to deal with in the case of the hostages".
From the Elysée adviser for strategic affairs, François Richier, aided by director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Afrikua the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk with a representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
He explains the French method.
Americans have to do this, so much for that was dopraven back to the country of their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
Do 'noise', they say, 'keep strongly vyslovujte' in the media, the words' fundamental rights of man ',' innocence ',' immediate 'liberation.
It is important to bring to the distress of the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
'Do more, the more you will ask you to stop. "
As attempts were made to the negotiations through diskrétních channels' silence solves nothing, "the Iranians are masters at 'evasive maneuvers."
Mr Richier recalls that the arrests of foreigners is' the Iranian family tactic: Taking hostages for political purposes "blackmail".
Announcing that liberation Klotildy Reissové (which will come on 16 August in the day when it will provide refuge in the French embassy) are also represented 'will require paying the high sums of money the Iranians' (kauce 230 000 euros).
And announce that Elysejský palace anticipuje cases of hostages, the phenomenon of 'which will vyostřovat'.
"The Iranians could in the future be able to arrest another roughly 1,800 French people living in Iran," it says.
On 28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left prison for 12 days, but still remains blocked in Iran.
Information is spreading: Majid Kakavand Iranian man, on which the United States are claiming that he was deported for illegal trade with the sensitive electronic equipment in relation to Iran, is in Paris is released on the basis of a decision of the judge.
The US Embassy, as well as many observers questioning on this worrying consensus.
For Washington, which is illegal in Iran's network to obtain materials for a nuclear programme, is the advance of Majida Khakavanda the bad news.
France settled for bargaining?
The release of the Iranian people for the liberation of a young French?
In another interview with by Allegrone 4 September, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
Elysejský palace, as it says, has not only been "shocked" by the decision of the judges, but for the opportunity to stand up against that.
"There have been talks between the presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie, the French government), but "cannot change the decision of the court," it notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is' limited 'under the supervision of the French intelligence services.
The Elysée adviser vytáčí telephone number, zavěšuje telephone up the handset and then informs the American diplomatku that Iranian man is currently in Paris buildings administered the Iranian Embassy.
At the time of the arrests Klotildy Reissové in Iran is developing Elysejský palace efforts, negotiating through the communiqué and organised "leaks" in the media, in order to persuade that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has' important 'and' influential 'role as a' mediator. "
Americans watching this activity is not without irony, and stating that the manipulation of bears fruit, as a number of articles in the press reflected the French official version.
Telegram on 25 August 2009 evokes the media 'blest' French officials'.
Based on what that level of 'gratitude' vyjadřovaná against M. Assadovi, asks Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their declarations full chvalořečí French official officials privately acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians in fact done '.
The document will then deals with the reasons that forced Elysejský palace to pay in this fiction.
Intense communication "is heading for the Validation policies of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria," analyses.
The policy pursued in 2008 'was pozorována many critical voices in France and abroad, and marked as premature and out gold stars that are not'.
The ', as the Syrian role of exaggeration', 'Paris is trying to demonstrate what chvalořeči Syria can vysloužit when playing a constructive role in the region ".
It also aims to "plant wheat nesváru between Syria and Iran.
American ambasáda knows it from a very good resources.
On 11 August, François Richier, told him: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians do something, whether it is this anything '
"But still, we thanked them. '
"This should at least bring chaos and confusion between the Iranians'.
Klotilda Reissová returning to France on 16 May 2010.
It is Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace.
In a communiqué thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria, for their 'active role in favour of the liberation of our krajanky'.
After online games after midnight for young Koreans
But South Korean government will adopt the law entitled 'Peciválský', which will ban adolescentům play online games after midnight, by block access to them, said responsible government officials.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December, so that he can ask the companies operating online games to block access to these Games after midnight younger persons 16 years, said officials of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry for the family.
"Many children are playing these games all night and then have problems with learning in school, and they are not able to lead a normal life in the course of the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to be guaranteed their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin for AFP, a leading official at the Department, which is in charge of the draft law.
Online games are newly available since 6 o'clock this morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, all the same.
The Government also assumes that it will ask the company to limit daily time access to these games for young people whose parents request it, added a responsible worker.
It can also be available to people who request it, free of charge, to reduce the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the countries most affected by the 'and' daily press regularly brings different facts associated with the intensity of use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in the world championships in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, and in the face of the 58 other nations.
The World Cup: The FIFA years in 2018-2022 establishes the host country.
Full of unrest because of suspicion of corruption establishes the FIFA Executive Committee on Thursday, the host country of the World Cup in 2018 and 2022, the choice of sovereignly politically motivated, where the struggle for influence and lobbying risk that surpassing the technical criteria.
Thing is certain, the Royal competition FIFA 2018se in the year will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Španělsko-Portugalsko, Nizozemí-Belgie).
In the year 2022 World Cup will be much exotičtější, while the International Federation is hoping that it can conquer new territory (Qatar, Australia) after its opening night on the African continent in 2010, or continue to take place in the United States or to the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of people who will be in the framework of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials in Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives us the opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the economic and political betting around the world.
Negotiations in the back rooms of faces the risk that will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish the hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the reports of the FIFA documentation English, španělsko-portugalská (2018) and the US (2022) contain the best arguments, as well as documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons not to have too much weight to the 22 members of the executive committee in the hour of the vote.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the discovery, leading to suspendování / CE two members of the European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adam) may destroy the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Cup just once, in a year.
The BBC deployed in the case on Monday, when the broadcast document 'napíchl on špendlík' three influential members of the CE mark (of the European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz, and Issa Hayatou.
How to make the FIFA nespokojenou and bring into difficulty English leaders with David Cameron in the first place.
The Prime Minister hopes that he will be able to repeat the move, which will have made his predecessors in the role of Tony Blair, which in 2005, has managed to obtain the organisation for the London Olympic Games in 2012.
This intense activity will be enough to add a new luster of England to his name for the CE (of the European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the twin Španělsko-Portugalsko chips is already prepared stadiums, his bill (the World Cup in Spain in 1982, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions cold sprchu.
Possible retaliatory measures against Angličanům and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal have only increased the position of Russia, which was an outsider, despite the gap in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin ruled that the World Cup into Curichu nepřemístí and publicly declared "unfair competition" in the run-up to the vote, in the verbal narážkách hardly pokroucených to the English press charges against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We are going after them, we are going to try to throw blátem is zkompromitovat," said Mr Poutin.
For the year 2022, seem to be a logical favourite in the United States with significant experience in 1994.
The performance of the economy in the world, the seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which separately, vyhotovily beautiful project.
But these candidacy appear to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002, in particular, have suffered "test."
Another threat: The World Cup, the 2026 China, which has horoucně wants FIFA made Asian chance for the year 2022 invalid.
With Katarem, which pulled out of the basement of a large business in the form of futuristických stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries are more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could pykat for weak charges TV (because of the time shift) paid European countries, as a driving force for the FIFA.
A second mandate: Zřejmost (security)
De Gaulle really hesitate.
Mitterrand aroused the appearance that Hesitate.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they are.
Mandate Elysejskému Palace calling someone else.
The current head of state, it will be a candidate in 2012.
But zřejmost is not in good line with the proportion of the secrecy of the functions of the presidency.
So we need to do, as the doubts constantly persisted.
In one, and in the second sense.
In 2006, without this trust, Jacques Chirac friends wanted to make claims to a third mandate has not been ruled out.
On 15 November, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that 'sometimes decide in the autumn of 2011.
As a reminder of the UMP members of parliament on Wednesday evening in the Élysée Palace, the perspective of the 'two mandates' zasela little horečný situation.
This was the official announcement of his candidacy?
Not far from that.
The president only remind you that the arrangement of the Constitution in 2008, reduced the number of five years to two terms of office.
It was from his party only statement, no announcement.
This is not the first time that resembles in such meetings humorným the tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you are still seven and a half years with me ', threw in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: 'Do not think that neuvažuji about the next stage. "
His předvčerejší statements do not make him a candidate more than the previous day; do not make him a candidate or less.
If the cause of the comments, this is due to the double the truth.
Speeding up the path to a candidacy to the PA, on the one hand.
But this does not enter the ring Ségolèna Royala what pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to be convicted.
On the contrary, it is, therefore, that his candidacy in 2012, it is clear that many in the PA want to order to combat sestav rather premature than intended.
A survey on the other hand.
Firstly, voters would prefer the candidacy of François transforming before the candidature of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the Express BVA-L ').
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and prudently people from the nearest vicinity of the Prime Minister.
"If possible, believes the defeat will not stand," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"It will still be to believe that we can win," Alain Juppé repairs, balanced with zřejmostí.
The euro: The European Central Bank to continue its purchases of titles.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central in the year should be an opportunity for a clarification of the conditions for the lifting of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of a large number of unusual operations of monetary policy, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges Institute for issuing securities have no doubt it will not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of deterioration of the situation in the already tense on the European markets, with the securities.
The political cost, in this case, it was higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde pay tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in favour of a solution to the crisis claims of European states.
She did not say whether he thinks that the bank could do more, by, for example, that it would increase its program of buying sovereign bonds.
"I reserve my account for my European partners (...)."
The night before, in Brussels, in his interrogation Commission for economic and monetary affairs of the European Parliament, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, has showed as výřečnější regarding its intentions and spokojil that said that the purchase of the titles on the secondary market, "continues", and that "we will see how we decide" during the meeting, which is being held this Thursday.
The only certainty: The European Central Bank will keep a sharp eye on their basic fixed interest rate to 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the underlying bond purchases from the European Central Bank, in the last week, have doubled to almost 1,35 billion euros.
And thanks to the nerozumnosti dohodců on the market for new purchases made yesterday, Irish and Portuguese bonds.
Overall, the central banks have bought the Eurosystem to 67 billion euros from May 2010.
Between dohodci anticipace in the market about the continuation of the purchases they bar no doubt see Party (29).
Even the economists do not expect any significant change of direction.
If lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the European Central Bank, is that the government-appointed Bank to provide unlimited liquidity to the generous terms and duration from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that this mechanism will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that this would be a significant change in the way of their agenda."
"If not, it would be to take the risk of provoking a short new tensions," said Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank.
'Progressive way announced during the first quarter of 2011, it seems likely, "" anticipates, Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its interventions in the market with the public debt, "to the European Central Bank to keep the volume of purchase of its bonds to revive anemic market," Norbert Bräms joining.
With regard to the exposure of European banks to the markets of sovereign debt in the euro zone continue to have the choice of nothing more than maintain its presence in the market.
'Needs at any price to replace the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way to prevent the outbreak of paid performances States belonging to the most fragile, "testified yesterday, a bond manager.
Because if interest rates vzlétly, States on this matter more to reduce its debt, rather than stabilise it.
It is saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi hrbí backs
After the beginning of the week for the Italy worrying the situation a bit, released yesterday by the flow of obligačních interest to 10 years.
A return to the temporary calm.
At the end of the meeting with the prime minister for the economy of the Regions said Giulio Tremonti heard how the situation qualifies as' nerozřešitelnou 'and that he' unexpected 'weekend, which then zúčastněny dementoval.
In any case, Tuesday, deviation from the long German interest reached a record 210 basis points, and the price of contracts to cover against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) soared up to 263 points in Rome, which has caused some excitement.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi said that in Spain deviation with the German interest rates were higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, by Gianni Letta, on its own, he said, that it is' too occupied 'development' turbulent markets and the possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, a third of the economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland '.
"The bad news is that it is as Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and nešifrovaně, the problem is the lack of growth and weak fiscal input, which goes hand in hand, and puts a risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts were Brussels for the government of a cold shower.
Italian growth is now expected to 1.1% in 2011 and to 1.4% in 2012... while the budget, which is available on its analysis of the Senate, to 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, kalkuluje the European Commission, the deficit in the public finances will be a further 4.3% of gross domestic product in the next year (against 3.9% of the projected government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of the new additions to the proposal for a summary of the state budget that could be put in place after the holidays, a $7 billion euros.
"If it is needed, will have to be adopted stringent new measures' judge Commissioner for economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the moment, Italy is taking the support of international institutions.
'The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we repeat this for a long time, "assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Board of the International Monetary Fund under pressure from Italy to the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term because, despite its significant debt (119,2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), is an effort to stabilise the required in Italy smaller than the effort required from other countries' notes, Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of OCDE.
There is the question of political instability.
14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion to censure the Chamber of Deputies, and then after that it can begin to organise the elections, which is at the end of March.
By that time, little appropriate for the decision in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde highlighted again yesterday in a press conference in Paris: "I think that the Europeans to demonstrate on Sunday, in the course of the day and night, are obviously very sympathetic determined committed to defend its currency and its monetary zone '.
Although it is all relative, yesterday, noted the expansion of the interest in European government bonds, produced water at the hands of governments and the European Central Bank.
But we cannot yet speak about normalization of the beginning.
Notaci Office Standard & Poor's announced that could record a debt downgrade of Portugal, the targets that were most focused different speculation.
'Because in May is a real lack of transparent and clear policy, especially in the banking systems, "says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
All the more so that 'political time is ticking more slowly than the time of the market'.
Aware of this danger and adjourned, which lies, intensifying the debate, European countries to strengthen the existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a wider scale, with their counterparts from the G20, they are going very well.
And with regard to the meeting of the Eurogroup (Eurogroupe) and clusters of Ecofin from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support the countries of the eurozone, with a focus on markets (see above).
When it comes to the Treasury (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, zapořčal on Tuesday in Singapore the way to Asia, to inform investors from the Far East, on the development of the crisis in Europe.
If it is not the purpose of this trip is to raise funds, they certainly the way to achieving that goal.
The first emissions securities FESF is foreseen for next month.
Yesterday in the US, the official representative of the agency, told Reuters that the United States will support any increase in funds mobilized additional direct through engagement in the FMI.
The country, which is in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, especially when it comes to the organisation of the labour market.
The reforms, which will go to the strict measures with the rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid a different way than the use of Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid at all costs that would be asking for international assistance before they apply their own budgetary korektivy and before deciding on the structural reforms needed to once again have a permanent confidence.
Participants in the capital of the European funds finally talk about the options, disponibilních for accelerating the process of normalising markets, sovereign obligacemi.
During his trip to Paris on 24 November Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether enough 750 billion euros mobilized Europe and the International Monetary Fund, the European Union would not hesitate to the stock of the securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is a player completely the first trade with European sovereign debt, thinks that additional around 100 billion euros would suffice, 'rather than' in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
Facility exists: It is the European mechanism for financial stability, subsidized to this day of 60 billion euros.

In the abstract, it is amount, which then will allow the companies to use part of the financing of the SGP on the orders of its double resources.
Now, finally, we come to the first amendments from.
Rektifikační law on the finances of the year 2010, which examines the financial committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains mechanisms set to guarantee these funds.
There are two: The creation of a special tax on equipment and increase taxes on the offices of the Ile-de-France.
First, because, in the text of the draft law, Article 15, is in favour of public institutions Société du Grand Paris'.
It is calculated, "the proceeds of this interest is 117 million euros a year".
The second is the rates for the office, which already exists "to be modernised, to increase the yield of the lessons learned from it and that this affect society Société du Grand Paris'.
How much would it brought?
A pipe dream.
This is not a vyčísleno in the text.
We have far to $4 billion.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources to go to 4 billion euros of capital funding, which will be mobilised by the state and put into companies, according to Société du Grand Paris' project, can read in the explanation of the reasons.
We in society SGP this system seems shocking.
"From the moment when we created the income tax, ndlr (both), can cover the study after a period of three years and then hrábnout to 4 billion, explains there. '
"It will be incorporated into the budget and used as necessary."
Society SGP is that 4 billion will připsány up in 2013 for the budget for the year 2014.
This mechanism, which promised 4 billion are still nepřítomným abonentům, risks that will cause a lot of parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on 7 December.
Mstiví hackers and přičinliví vyzvědači
The case of the WikiLeaks has a twofold significance.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal exposed the scandal, which seems to be the only scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it says everything about the profound changes in the international level, and anticipates future ruled by the regression.
But let us move popořádku.
The first aspect of the WikiLeaks, this is a confirmation of the fact that every document drawn up by the secret service (any nation) consists solely of the press cuts.
'Extraordinary revelations about the way the Americans' sexual life Berlusconi is announcing what we already months everyone could read newspapers in kterýchkoliv (all in addition to these two Berlusconi own), and the infamous karikaturní profile Kadáfího was already long for kabaretní performer- device for skeče.
The rule, according to secret documents which may consist only of reports already known, it is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
When you go into a bookshop, which devotes ezoterické literature, you will see that each work repeats (Graalu, záhadě Rennes-le-Château, Templářích or Zednářích) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
And not only because of that, the author of the texts of the occult not currently missing after new information (not even know where to look for a report on the non-existent), but because those who are okultismu believes only do what they know, and what this confirms what we have already learned.
This is a mechanism for the success of Dan Brown.
The same is true for the secret documents.
Informátor is lazy and lazy (or limited spirit), the head of the secret service (and if not, it could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération), which considers true only what he admits.
Information with a high level of discretion on Berlusconi, which the American Embassy sent home state, were the same, which published Newsweek with the week before.
So, why is the revelation of these documents nadělalo so much fuss?
On the one hand, they say, what everyone already knows, disgraceful man and that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since when can the heads of state of the plane to fly out to make phone calls or a dinner, lost its diplomatic post and, with the exception of a few small exercise in representation have been transformed in the center of a spy.
Any viewer screen films on investigations knows very well that only of self-righteousness that seemingly ignoring.
However, the fact that it is being repeated publicly, have vilified the duty of hypocrisy and cast a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can gain the most strictly classified information the most powerful country in the world is a tough blow, not significant, for prestige of this state home.
The scandal is affecting how the victims, as well as his' vykonavatele '.
But let us move on from there to the profound truth about what happened.
Once, in times of Orwell, it was possible to have all the power, as a kind of Big Brother, who controlled every movement of its people.
Orvellovo prophecy has been demonstrated since the ability to control every movement with phones, all carried out by the transaction, navštívený hotel, used the motorway, and so on and so forth, has become a citizen of absolute victims věnce power.
But when demonstrujeme, as this is the way things are now, that even the 'information' tomb with nejtajnějšími powerful cannot resist intervention some hackera be monitoring report, it is no longer a one-way street and becoming oběžníkem.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as mstitel citizen - can know all the secrets of the power.
How can maintain power, which is no longer able to maintain its own secrecy?
It is true that already Georg Simmel said that is the real secret of which are totally bereft of secrecy (and which are totally bereft of secrecy will not be able to be detected); it is also true that all the information on the nature of a Berlusconi or Merkel is actually ran bezobsažným secret because it is vytaženo from public life; but to discover, as did WikiLeaks that secrecy Hillary Clinton was bezobsažnými in secrecy, means odnímat him all the power.
WikiLeaks did no mistake with Sarkozy and Merkel, but has something big Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of the wounds inflicted powers so significant?
It is clear that, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - that would be tantamount to its publication vylepeném on a poster on a street corner.
But it is also quite clear that the current technology is useless to hope that we can maintain the secrecy of the news over the phone.
There is nothing better than to find out if and when the head of state travelled by air and teamed up with some of his colleagues.
How will in future be maintained in secret private and sensitive news?
Well, I know that, for the moment, has forecast falls into science fiction, and so it is a fantastic, but I imagine the government officials who transported discreetly after the formalities of uncontrollable routes and wear only those reports that they know by heart, or rather rare hidden information in podpatku shoes.
The information will be retained in unikátních copies in zásuvkách closed the key: All in all, an attempt to espionage in the Watergate affair had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write, that the technology is now moving forward, this means alone run backwards.
A century later, when the wireless telegraf mean a revolution in communications, Internet break-up telegraf based on drátech (the telephone).
Videokazety (analogové) enabled milovníkům cinemas take a film, step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets montáže now, while CDs (číslicové) allow only to the chapters that means after makroporcích.
Through rychlovlaků dojedeme from Rome to Milan for three hours, while on the road and air transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
So it is extraordinary that a policy and communications technology, will come back to the cars behind horses.
The last comment.
Sometimes the press to try to understand what is engineered in secret embassy.
It is now the embassy, demanding that confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France hackla their promises on financing
A year after the Copenhagen agreement is the time to test compliance with promises to quickly odblokovaná funding (řečená with the fast start financing (fast start) or premature), by developed countries.
And the great French hacky were detected
In the Copenhagen agreement with the developed countries committed to provide $30 billion from 2010-2012.
The European Union has promised to 7.2 billion euros for three years and France 1,26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
At the launch of the EU's big draws COP16 card to persuade its partners on the feasibility of its commitment on the financing of the fast start: The report detailed action of its member states, the press conference, the grand side event, distributing brožurek...
Transparent operation nedocenitelná and overpriced on their real value: The developed countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries and civil society have been the same, with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU is announcing that, in the year 2010 to make 2.2 billion euros, which puts it on track to keeping its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we look at the detail, we see that things are much more complicated.
These funds are under the Copenhagen Accord "new and additional" to ensure that it is done, without increased burden would be to the detriment of Public aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what the meaning of "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed the harmonisation of some member states, among others, as well as France, blocked the process.
Today everyone will have a reference that suits him best.
The European Commission, for example, was deemed a reference 2009: The international funding and she kept it even adds 150 million in three years, as the financing of the fast start.
Other countries choose similar reference to the annual payment dates or with dates on the level of public aid for development.
By contrast, France is that the financing of the 'all new projects' 2010 are "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenses of the previous periods or to the global level Public aid for development d Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of aid to developing countries, France can stay the same (or even lower), is to stick to its commitment for the funding of the "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is division in gifts and loans.
There is no rule, and everyone has their own way of calculating.
Some, such as France, are thinking that 1 of loaned €1 to €darovanému.
Obviously, it is difficult to verifiable: Contriving přirovnatelná is not.
If the loans can be documented for some of the investments that are cost-effective (often on projects related to the reduction in emissions, in a combination of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one of the euro, which come as the equivalent of one euro, which we..., we should not see it in their commitments, but as the cost of borrowing for creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can give only such justification: 'Respect' their commitment of $420 million euros, making 91.5% of the loan (389,8 million euros) and 8.5% of gifts (36,1 million euros) - see the document the EU to do this they can be verified.
It is the only country in the European Union, which is in the scale of the loan.
Germany has claimed from 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands, or Slovakia (among others) are honouring their commitments to 100% of gifts.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union will on the part of the €1 in satisfaction among its promise to give France only 10 centimů and considers this effort for comparable.
Beautiful kejklířský bit!
In summary, in its financing of the 'fast start' France operates with dual šejdířstvím: On the one hand with the development of the shares at the time, and on the other hand, with real financial burdens.
Although spends only 36,1 million euros, can persuade that publishes 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to their promises.
Manipulation finance minister (because it seems that, even though this is the Bercy, who was such a decision) could have a double negative impact at the same time within the EU (why should the Member States to continue to donate, when I only need to borrow?) and in the negotiations because developing countries are not completely naive...
Chapter of early funding is little otázečkou, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of discussions about the change.
But it could be a crumb of sand in a huge machine, which is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to this is the first year of funding.
Possible should France to announce the change in the way of leadership of the record for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for their commitment and of decency and fairness for the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions about savings into the long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): An issue 'or' dodatečnosti about the way accounting loans.
France should change its attitude that has become so pokrokářská for these deposits, as it is on the other.
All hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizetové, which arrives in Cancunu next week.
The surprising announcement on the fast start France and its vision of a 'dodatečnosti' and the use of loans could lead to an increase in the level of international confidence necessary for it to be able to continue to make progress in the discussions.
The alarm on pesticides, which they have digested children.
Ten-year child pozře one day 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of future generations (ex- Movement for the rights and the preservation of the future generations).
The association, which points out that its results are signifikantní statistical value in the light of the small number of samples analysed, but they are characterised zpracovávanou issue ', bought between July and September, food normally konzumované in four dishes and one easy meal as a slight svačinu to one child roughly ten-year in supermarkets in l Oise and in Paris.
This typical dishes, including official recommendation - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day, as well as sweets, were analysed Dr. on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluting officials.
The balance sheets of the dishes is overwhelming: 81 chemicals from 42 classified as carcinogenic substances, possible or probable and five substances cabotaged clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances which could act as a disruptive for the gland with internal vyměšováním (PE), according to the studies of the few institutions, such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Even though in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical adopted individually are not exceeded, in our research well we can see that the reality in exposure to consumers, perhaps to carcinogenic substances kontaminujícím, and / or the PE is amazing," says the association.
Breakfast butter and tea with milk contain themselves about ten résiduí with possible carcinogenic effects and three identified as certain carcinogens, as is the case with about 20 MRLs that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The bones, imported from Brazil, cited studies as a small svačinka contains traces of six chemicals, including in France banned fungicidní a means to an end.
The same is true for Green fazolky of Kenyi, included in the lunch, in which the study appeared strong traces of the insecticide banned in the EU.
Moreover, biftek mletého of meat in a tuna and even houska and chewing gum were punctuated with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroformu.
Steak for dinner of salmon was' richest 'with 34 objevenými chemical reziduy and even analysis plastového plates used to ohřátí food in the microwave oven no analysis.
The final risk for consumers this' kontaminujících of a cocktail of substances' is probably the most underestimated, "said the study.
An ecological Evropa-Zelení (EE-LV) proposed 'in the face of the urgent situation' to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the rise of civilisation 'disease'.
In July a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) has been investigating the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, from 76 in cereáliích.
