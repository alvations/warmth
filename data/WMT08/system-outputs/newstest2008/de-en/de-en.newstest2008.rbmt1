Foods guilty at European inflation
Main reason for the increase in the inflation measured in the Euro-zone is the wildly increasing food prices.
.
Official prognoses came from only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
.
The EZB is attempted to keep the inflation rate under two percent or at least short of the two-percent brand.
.
With 3,3 percent, the inflation rate reached a twelve year record high in November in Germany; in Spain, the rate of 3,6 climbed upon 4,1 percent.
The food and energy prices that increased are responsible for the increase in the inflation in the Euro-zone.
The MATIF wheat notations climbed about 88 percent and a record high has also reached the course for soybeans since 1973.
In the case of food oil and milk products as well, there was a considerable price increase in 2007.
The Weltmarktpreis for rough oil climbed in this year about 52 percent - in the past month, the price per barrel of black gold reached almost 100 US dollar.
According to the EZB, the inflation will climb in year 2008 from 2,1 to 2,5 percent, however one expects 2009 a decreasing to 1,9 percent.
For the coming 3 4 months, Analysten comes from a 3 percent inflation rate, however numbers the annual average rate with 2,1 percent.
For 2008, experts count on the EZB reducing the interests twice.
Gallup locates government crisis
After long stagnation, the number of Fidesz Sympathisanten considerably grew until the beginning of December. The party has first time since 2002 the largest basis warehouse while the agreement for the socialists attained a low point that never yet present of 13 percent according to Gallup.
In the case of the parteitreuen voters, the difference clearly fells from thanks to the high determination of the opposition advocates: More than two thirds (71 percent) contrast with a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ lie according to inquiry under the parliamentary entry hurdle: They come to two percent in the entire population.
The number of the party voters grew in both warehouses by a percent.
In comparison with the last low point, the general economic atmosphere worsened - the share which "noticeably" judge the economic situation of the country "badly" was never yet so high (41 percent) previously while they consider further 46 percent "bad quite".
After more hopeful views in the spring and summer, the families see the change of their financial situation again more pessimistically.
.
A Gallup inquiry carried out in December showed that 71% of the respondent - a historical high - assessed the work of the Prime Minister as "rather as right badly".
Thirteen percent of the respondent have great trust or trust generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány while the share of the advocates for Viktor Orbán 38 percent comprises.
Absolutely do not trust round 54% the head of government, the Fidesz compared with 27% mistrust of the party leader.
One of the indicators of the political atmosphere is the number of of those one could obtain this mine without government changing into the grip as well the dissatisfaction with the minister-president.
If 35% had still spoken in favor of the whereabouts of the government and the head of government following the unrests in the past October, this share amounts to only 20% today while the relative majority (33 percent), the solution only into new choices see.
Asked for their interest in the plebiscite 60 percent answered that they would participate "for certain" and further 20% hand in their vote "probably".
By comparison: if the parliament choices took place on this Sunday, only 55 percent would go to the urns "for certain", further 15% consider their participation "probable". In the light of these tendencies, the result of the plebiscite would be foreseeable.
74% would is become correct against the study charges, 79% against the practice charge and 84% against the hospital day money.
This transferred the ones that participate to the group at the plebiscite "for certain" the shares of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital charges even 81, 84 or 89 percent would be amounted to.
Auchan the most expensively increases by almost one fifth, Tesco
The Hypermarkets in the Budaörser trade area kept the average price increase of 16% of the last year of this year as well, with the difference that there was no increase in the value-added tax.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budaörser trade triangle, the price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Napi" increased of this year as well about 16 percent, however price increases were registered on all hypermarkets of via 1.000 HOOF.
After the prices are "davongaloppiert" on the food markets in the past December, price increase prozentuell did not turn out to be drastic, compared with the anyway high, earlier exit level.
However, it has an effect on the consumers certainly as a deterrent that that is not for which they had still paid in the last year far under 9.000 HOOF of this year available once for 10.000 HOOF.
The price of the "Napi" goods basket crossed the magische 10.000 hoof border about at least 91 HOOF on the investigated markets.
The highest price amounted to 10.573 HOOF.
(The price was next to 6.800 HOOF in 6800.)
The prices for Unicum and lively fish almost remained on previous year level, heavily the prices for turkey breast nettings, nut and poppy by contrast increased.
Prices for flour and bread corresponded to the data of the central statistical office of Hungary, in the case of Auchan, there was however 1kg bread rolls for 139 Forint.
It gave up no competition limited price slump with the product under 200 Forint.
The price was surprising a two liter of Coke Cola pledge bottle here of under 200 Forint, therefore the drink cost inclusive pledge only 257 HOOF.
Nevertheless, Cora performed this year in the "Napi" Warenkorbs comparison Auchan the most expensively and the most suitably.
Our calculations showed that Cora the prices in the "Napi" goods basket in comparison with the Christmas prices in the past year about 15 while Tesco and Auchan in each case increased about 18 percent.
The difference between the most inexpensive goods basket of the previous year and the most expensive of the year of this year amounted to 12% while the raise comprised between most inexpensive goods basket of the past year and most expensive of the current year 21%.
The average price rise amounted to 1.480,00 HOOF.
The average price increase was still next to 1.206,00 Forint in the previous year, however the value-added tax raise made noticeable for itself with the prices for last Christmas.
Exact this procedure met the trade badly: Apparently the department stores were not able to decide so rightly what price chips they should use in the individual articles since the effects of the price increase were unabsehbar on the consumption behavior.
(If the vendor plans the circulation speed of a product badly, he can fall about essential profits in the price span which follows the traffic intensity.)
The price increase of the "Napi" goods basket turned out to be Mehwertsteuer caused so radically in the past year that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 about 1720 Forint whereas the price difference was with the most inexpensive basket mere of 844 Forint.
Such extremes were not observed this year as the most expensive basket cost about 1.630,00 Forint more than in the previous year and even in the case of the cheapest one there was a price rise of 1.284,00 Forint.
A catastrophic price increase was manifested in the comparison of the two last Christmas seasons, the price of the daily consumer items on the hypermarkets increased for months less in 20 more than 30 percent.
(This again does not confirm the data of the central statistical office of Hungary unconditionally: The statistical office established one with some basic foods in the period of 12 months more than 30-prozentige price increase.
So for example next to flour also in the case of eggs.)
If one however throws a look into the "Napi" goods basket, this seems in the case of almost latter impossible since the price level of the product which cost already in the previous year at worst about scarcely more itself than 10 percent rose.
Flour suppliers are obviously in a more powerful position, than the egg suppliers - in any case they were able to shift the drastic price increase onto the Multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported continuously by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of the customers in the three department stores does not at all look at the prices more.
Large amounts are purchased from all, holdable foods go over the counters in pallets.
Wednesday vormittag there were endless queues in the case of the spot as suddenly the number of the customers exploded.
However, a smaller customer frequency is reported by the country so that many Multis are complained in the case of the opinion researchers that they could not reach even the planned turnover, that is not only in the case of foods but also in the case of nachhaltigen consumption materials.
In many cases one saves at disinfectants
.
The hygienic conditions in the hospitals, the practising inheritance placing of the beds, the overloading of personnel - everything factors which are not precisely zuträglich for the damming of the infections, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums.
In many cases one saves in the case of the disinfectants as well.
In the Traumatologie department of the János hospital, a MRSA infection was diagnosed recently.
That against antibiotic resistente bacterium was found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was insulated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection here.
.
Until 10. December of this year, infections initiated by multiresistente virus were reported from hospitals 1094 at the national Nosocomialis Surveillance system, so the leading doctor of the national Epidemiologiezentrums, Karolina Böröcz.
Infections initiated by multiresistente virus were therefore registered so much, in the hospitals for certain, the true figure might however be higher.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, that against Methicillin Oxacillin resistenten Staphylococcus aureus.
.
Sa limited infections (sore throat, tonsillitis, ignitions of the skin or wounds as for example) usually react well to antibiotics, they are heilbar well.
If the means are however measured out too high or used inexpertly, respondierenden bacteria antibiotic resistente which spread out in the hospitals quickly under corresponding conditions result from that well.
In the case of patients with weakened or durably badly functioning immune systems, but also at age or patients with small body weight can cause these bacteria difficult infections, as for example wound infection or blood poisoning, therefore sepsis.
The MRSA infection is belongs nothing special, such occurrences for the medical director according to of the János hospital, to the Krankehausalltag.
One may confuse the infection with the epidemic, manhte Tibor Nyulasi - there is not only MRSA there where it is not looked for.
Resistent against antibiotics
"Such patients are insulated, the maintenance personnel Gummihandschuhe and masks carry with the supply and we have the antibiotics necessary for the treatment" - Tibor Nyulasi so.
.
Test takings too rare
The majority of the infections initiated by MRSA in hospitals would be avoidable, however the currently reigning conditions and circumstances are unfavorable for the Eindämmung of the arising or the expansion of the multiresistenten virus, say Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs predominantly in hospitals and retirement homes, the hospitals should investigate the delivered patients and insulate MRSA-infizierte immediately.
In the Hungarian hospitals, the microbiological test taking is not however so frequently practiced.
Not least of all, because there is vonseiten of the state ill cash-register no allowances for this investigation.
Most cases would come along only then to the light of day if the patient already has a noticeable MRSA infection, so the medical manager of the Epidemiologiezentrums.
Vonseiten there are strict recommendations for the European union, to the corresponding application of antibiotics in the humane medicine, there are however guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and Krankheitsbilder in Hungary as well.
Antibiotic therapies should be purposeful that is, microbiological investigations are necessary in order that no resistance to the means can develop, this general instruction of hospitals is always complied with not as well.
Under out-patient or in the basic supply the patients, microbiological test takings are even even more rarely, so Karolina Böröcz.
Is saved in the case of the disinfectants
Verify scientific proofs that MRSA is transferred from a patient on the other the most frequently by the maintenance personnel.
Therefore the hand washing or the wear of gloves and masks is just of a great significance, however there are considerable deficiencies in the hospitals in this area as well.
MRSA is transferred by droplet infection or contact, in the indigenous hospitals, it is not however always possible to insulate the infizierten patients.
The rooms even often are overfilled, the beds connected barely although there should be a distance from at least 1,5 meter between them from epidemiologischer sight.
As Karolina Böröcz continues to mark, it unfortunately even occurs financially for less well placed hospitals into that that one saves in the case of disinfectants, there are few male nurses, many patients - everything factors which favor the arising of infections absolutely.
Such infections are demonstrably far less frequent there or the further distribution of the virus can be stopped where these protective measures are observed, so Karolina Böröcz.
Government program against MRSA
To get MRSA infections under control causes enormous costs for the health insurance, therefore they are fought everywhere.
In England for example, the prevention of MRSA or their Eindämmung in the government program were recorded.
After first signs, the program is successful - published data as occupy, are the tendency of the MRSA infections in England declining.
The European center for medical prevention (ECDC) declared the prevention of the arising of multiresistenten viruses ((under this, even MRSA) as well as the prevention of infections in hospitals one of its priorities.
Death steering wheel police leader was not drunk
In the case of that of the police leader of the XXII. The official expert opinion is now known region's caused autoaccident with deadly exit.
.
The expert opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, the police leader had consumed this no alcohol loudly before he put him against the steering wheel.
.
(According to StVO, this is not however a mitigating circumstance - the steering wheel has even if pedestrians do not cross the road at the zebra strip, Nachrang.)
The pedestrian is killed for its injuries after his delivery into the hospital.
According to police reports, the steering wheel suffered a shock, after that reset its functions and attempted about retirement.
The Budapest state legal profession initiated its determinations for the occurrence.
Moreover, Attila Morvai mentioned that the former police leader co-operated with the investigators from the beginning.
Further 400 mil. EUR for infrastructure
On Friday in Budapest, finance secretary János Veres and Marta Gajecka, vice-President of the European Investment bank (EIB) signed three credit arrangements worth entire 400 mil. EUR. The money should flow into development, traffic and environmental protection infrastructure and energy economy.
The European Investment bank (EIB) granted in year 2006 300 mil. EUR frames for the financing of traffic and environmental protection projects which are implemented with allowances by the cohesion fund. The credit contract for 100 mil. has already been signed earlier, in the current agreement, it is a matter the verliebenen 200 mil. EUR of the use.
The sum arranged in the loan contract of 150 mil. EUR should be spent on budgetäre financing of educational projects as well.
The EIB granted altogether 300 mil. EUR for this purpose for Hungary; the remaining 150 mil. EUR are decided on the use later in the context of the widening of the credit contract.
.
At the meeting, the U course line 4 was also mentioned.
It was arranged as soon as Hungarians clarified the details of the U course financing with the EU, the original contract and possible modifications are discussed again.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in first quarter 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed altogether 113 projects worth entire of 8,4 Mrd EUR worth Hungary.

Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabelhaft - the whole of Europe looks attentively at the Balkan State mentioned earlier rarely.
What where and who buys, at the EU's most proper still market which becomes more expensive wildly?
.
Bulgaria is zweifelsohne the most coveted plaster for real estate purchases in the East European area currently, with favorable ski apartments and houses at the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa belong to that most condescended, Albena, the "gold coast", the "sun coast" and the historical small towns Sozopol and Nessebar are the Renner at the sea, however real estates are more and more as well in demand all around Kavarna and Balcik.
Attract according to estimates of Re. Analysten in Bulgaria wid also of the state inner early or late investors, Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena and Triavna more buyers as, for example record and also the noticeably favorable area of soot.
The capital of Sofia offers enticing offers as well - trade and office areas offer highest yields.
Bulgaria is to be become one of the most attractive European Golferparadiese on the best way and tourists therefore attracted next to the summer and winter season in the other two seasons as well.
Therefore Vorausschauende investors already purchase now in the great style, for example all around Bansko.
According to Analysten, people who acquire real estates in Bulgaria aims at a change of their life change as well.
Most buyers are Englishmen, business prospects however also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Rumania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are present too while there are Russian buyers in the case of the Black Sea and in the ski areas predominantly.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, Georgij Jankov says regional director of Re. Bulgarias.
That which want to lower buy either revitalisierte real estates by 50100.000 Euro or descended houses by 515.000 Euro that they then renovate themselves.
Good tying and Erreichbarkeit as well as communication possibilities are capitalized but even the closeness is decisive for the buyers to a city, businesses and doctors.
That which are in search following a vacation domicile (Bulgaria was listed for vacation objectives of the Germans in December under the Top Ten) belong to the second category.
The third group is arranged by business people which invest with the objective of a medium- to long-term value increase.
Real estates in the capital are caused by the always growing demand meanwhile continuously more expensively.
Within the EU, the real estate prices are to be sure the lowest in Bulgaria, in the past five years, there was 21 percent.
The price increase with the real estate prices crosses by far the increase of the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries deliberate on the schedule of Bali in which the emission reducing measures for the time to 2012, therefore are established at the end of the Kyoto protocol.
Currently a violent debate is in operation between industrial and developing countries.
The USA has already signaled that they do not want to negotiate about concrete numbers, however they would be ready until to reduce 2020 by 25 40 percent the hothouse gas emissions in comparison with 1990.
The other large question of the conference is whether the Industriestaaten are ready to support the developing countries both financially technologically in addition to the reduction of the emissions and.
.
That the Kyoto protocol is assumed managed adaptation funds by a 16-köpfigen Council, probably in the case of the UN's global environment facility (GEF) as is to be read in the "Piac és profit".
Hungary's six percent
Minister for the environment Gábor Fodor supports in the name of Hungary the effort of the EU in keeping its outrider role with global climate protection measures and until to achieve 2009 a new international agreement.
The secretary explained who the hothouse gas emissions will reduce EU by 20% until 2020 (measured against the values of 1990), independent of whether the "agreement" is achieved successfully "according to 2012" or. The union would is be even ready to support a 30-prozentige reduction soferne other large Industriestaaten of the world or developing countries ready too to fulfill its obligations responsibly to measure forces and.
Gábor Fodor emphasized that the objective of the states, the 1997 had joined the Kyoto protocol, a reduction of only 5,2 percent was whereas the EU with then had already agreed its 15 member states to a minus of 8%.
The guideline for Hungary is reduction of the hothouse gas emissions 1985 87 about 6% in comparison with the years - a guideline that the country will quite meet as one must read in the ministry's of the environment press communication.
The use is high on Bali - in any case the long-term international climate political agreement must be finished within two years, otherwise it would become effective for certain only to 2012. In this instance no renewed, international emission reduction system would follow the reduction projects established in the Kyoto protocol, international scientific climate change committee of the UN distinguished with the Nobel Peace Prize emphasized the meaning of which the IPCC, the one as well in its most recent report.
By this means the emission reduction would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth more than 2°C would be unavoidable, which would result in extremely grave and irreparable consequences according to Wissenschaftern.
British army advertizes on YouTube
Units of the British army published for the purpose of popularity increase on the video portal receptions on operations in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have loaded since March 2006 Videos on operations conducted against the Taliban into the network, reports the BBC.
The miniature cameras fastened on to helmets turned receptions are checked at the Air Force restart point in Kandahar and sent to London then where they are placed into the internet.
Political message unavoidable
Soldiers of the Air Force have already contributed 139 such receptions, their "canal" was times regarded than 75.000 more.
The British Ministry of Defense was registered under "defenceheadquarters" in spring 2007 in order Videos over Iraqi and to publish afghanische operations but has the British Aussenministerium (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace troops (MNFI) stationed in Iraq as well its own YouTube channels.
Insertion into Afghanistan
The Air Force has the Videos originally with the objective soldiers publish to recruit and as the Ministry of Defense says, the contributions serve the purpose as well to inform the population of the real objectives of the international uses.
Such type's published propaganda is almost cost-free in comparison with conventional television advertisings, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to the BBC, however these Videos always carry in themselves a certain degree of political message as they confirm the existence authorization of the military measures decided by the government in its own way.
Americans advertize with play
The army must however also fight against amateur receptions which worked on it carefully next to that, get zensurierten receptions into the network as well - as for example such which show the soldiers' death: In the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films, it is spoken about the losses at most that the bloody sides of the war are not however shown.
Of the war show places in Iraq and in Afghanistan, numerous Videos turned in use has incidentally already been loaded to the platform, the Britons however just a short while ago discovered this "kind" for themselves.
The Americans advertize meanwhile on the somewhat other type, namely with the shooting play downloadable free-of-charge "America's Army" into which the player can slip in the context of a simulation more or less true to life into the soldier's skin.
Christmas celebration with Tombola and Pogatsche in the ministries
Work secretary Mónika Lamperth is by no means zimperlich: Instead of a Christmas celebration, it organizes a work conference their staff members can have year 2007 died away with coffee and Pogatsche at which.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, others conjure in the civil servant hearts Christmas atmosphere with Tombola or activation.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and Buffet - thus the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already recorded the offices as well.
A ministry's greatest Christmas celebration is held heuer in the defense department, however the ministry's staff members are not in addition expected.
With "the orphans' Christmas celebration", children of fallen soldiers are given a present, with the "mission celebration," family members are entertained for stationed soldiers currently abroad, there is however a reception for the press as well.
The department makes available around 25 mil. for the solemnities.
In comparison with other departments, the national agency for development (NFÜ) beats and the ministry for economy and traffic over the ropes.
The 4.32 mil. Forint expensive Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of Economics are restrained in the house of the future that approximately 350 of 600 staff members is expected.
The focus of the solemnities to be sure lies at Christmas, there will however be live Acts and a Tombola lottery as well.
The national agency for development (NFÜ) held its 4,7 mil. Forint expensive Christmas celebration on Wednesday in the house of the state justice Council (OIT), with concerts and a banquet.
The hall rent amounted to 1 mil. Forint, the remainder was more than guests loaded 400 passed off for this.
According to our information, a department of the NFÜ is invited with another Christmas celebration as well, which of the Hungarian economic development center (Zrt LIKES) is organized from EU moneys.
For the celebration the building of the comedy theater ("Vígszínház") was rent.
Confirmed this this information not has Zrt since the appropriate ones did not reach us.
To which the approach?
The NFÜ was open the OIT building not only to the guests but also the ministry for justice and police essences which restrained the Lucia ball instead of a Christmas celebration on the 7. December there.
For the use of the rooms, they had to pay no rent to the OIT.
Round 500 visitor came to the ball.
.
One communicated on inquiry of [origo]: None reigned ball dress or approach duty at the ball.
The ministries for health, work and home rule in each case prepare for Puritan celebration.
The Ministry of Health organizes for round 400.000 Forint the celebration for the staff members in its own four walls.
Work secretary Mónika Lamperth loads its staff members official garnicht for a Christmas celebration, but rather for the conference for the year end.
One calculates for guests with approximately 180, who - the press department so - are only entertained with coffee and Pogatsche, the celebration with 350.000 Forint goes out.
Home rule secretary Gordon Bajnai will activate simply with its colleagues only in the ministry's auditorium.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own fixed hall to which 436 staff members are expected.
The outputs were calculated per person with 2.500 Forint - about this money, there is a Buffet reception with subsequent activation.
Since beginning of the period in office of János Veres, the staff members of the PM have celebrated every year in this way.
No correct party atmosphere will however answer - not only because of the secretary's official speech but also because the celebration for the afternoon was applied.
The agriculture ministry loads on the 20. January for a New Year reception, the ministry's Christmas celebration fells from this time.
One invites one one hundred guests in lock Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to information of the department, the outputs with 1.000 Forint are calculated per guest.
As the press department reports, it becomes a very simple being reception for which foreign diplomats accredited only in Hungary are invited.
The receptions which are organized every year begin with a short address of the secretary traditionally and provide with diffident feasting.
As the enstprechenden press places report [origo] inquiry on, there will be a Christmas celebration neither in the case of the Aussen nor at the educational ministry.
Asked for the costs of the Christmas celebration one was able to give no information with the press department of the ministry of the environment.
In any case, were summoned than 400 guests more for the celebration which is organized in the arts and crafts museum.
More and more forces mobilize for giant strike
The league trade union and the Hungarian trade union federation formieren on Friday their coordination committee for the strike of indefinite duration beginning on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest large scale assembly is held, on Monday - on the day of the plebiscite to the health insurance law -, the work lower placing begins.
Striking caused, considerable traffic handicaps are expected as the railroad traffic is set almost completely and the Budapesters as well strike public traffic businesses (BKV) until 13 o'clock.
Details for the strike on Monday are announced together on Friday nachmittag by the league trade union and the trade union federation.
It becomes one as well LEAGUE - MOSZ strike committee founded which is responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a protest large scale assembly is held and from Monday, all organizations which joined with the strike lay down the work for indefinite period if with the government no agreement is achieved.
In other words was not defined.
If the national Council should not adopt the health insurance law, the trade unions cancel immediately the calling upon to strike.
If the law is however adopted, the strike committees convene in order to deliberate on the further procedure.
On the basis of the agenda of the national Council on Monday, it is even imaginable that takes place only in the later evening hours or gar only at midnight the voting on the health insurance law.
Through the strikes beginning on Monday, one will have to expect considerable traffic handicaps: The railwaymen lay down their work for indefinite period, in the morning, the major part of the public traffic means turns off and more than half of the Volán societies.
At the same time there will in many cases be highway blockages of a direction.
Are numerous trade unions for the calling upon to strike and civil organizations followed - the list web site is updated the participant continuously on the league.
Some organizations announced strikes for a fixed indefinite time, others plan a limited work lower placing.
Until Thursday nachmittag, it was still possible to achieve railwayman VDSZSZ no agreement on sufficing performances between the Hungarian railroad MÁV and the marriages of trade union although more and more people with the course is just about the Christmas holidays on the way.
According to previous reports, one strikes in the case of the BKV by operating start up to at 13, at the Budapest airport between 7 and 9 o'clock early, the LEAGUE trade union for current and warmth energy lays down the work for four hours and the teacher trade union bwz. the democratic teacher trade union called up for 2or 2 8 of hour strike.
The Hungarian doctor association strikes alternierend country-wide at various times, the EDDSZ, the democratic trade union this in the health and social essence employee, a lower organization of the SZEF, the forum for cooperation of the trade unions, restrains a two hour Warnstreik.
Is the four points demanded from the league important that the government retracts the draft for reforming the health insurance and submits a new conception for social discourse.
The second requirement affects the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model which becomes due from the next year.
Requirement number three sounds that the right justifiable job groups the access to the early pension system is already given before 2010.
The fourth point is that this did did not not submit accept that from the Ministry of Transportation to the league trade union belonging VDSZSZ offer affecting the additional lines and a new concept now demands.
Political Capital: Hungarian guard increases state risk
According to the department for risk analysis (Risk Analysing division) of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian guard founded in this August with support of the "movement for a better Hungary" lifted Hungary and the region's risk in several respect.
It is been statement in the institute's "risk warning report" among other things: The highest political risk the "increase of the already existing ethnischen tensions between the gypsy and non-gypsy population in Hungary which could lead even at short notice to violent ethnischen confrontations" represents in context with the Hungarian guard's activities.
The strategy of the Hungarian guard who aims supposedly at the provocation of such a confrontation thus is main reason for that the research institute.
As reported, this is seen persons responsible in this politically as a failure of sides: "People of the public life left representatives of radical political groupings the discussion of the Roma question which were now based their political strategy on the Roma Hungary contrast".
One supposes that this intensify the problem, make the rational dialog impossible, extremities would favor as well as increase the probability of violent confrontations.
The Forschungsinsitut not least of all "considerably" means "harmfully" thanks to the enormous attention of sides of the indigenous and foreign media, "Hungary's picture abroad" ausserdem which would have activities of the Hungarian guard", what the trust in the stability and democratic ripeness affects particularly".
We remember: Since fall 2006, the re-organization of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuous in the lift so that, since summer 2007, several have been founded organizations naming "national self-defense organization".
"It is mean to these groupings that they in each case define as a civil organization while they boast openly about this, their members on - armed now and then - to prepare defense tasks (catastrophe protection, state defense, Ordnungshütung), with reference to the police's unsuitability the police's, the army or the state himself", it was called.
And further: In accordance with that method which attempts, that everything occurs passed away political efforts based on the policy and party peevishness of the population as a middleclass initiative to tarnen.
The emphasis of the civil character and the organization form therefore serve for the avoidance of legal hurdles which could emerge in the course of the entry at court only - there is not a political strategy at the same time.
As one must find in the analysis, the activities present a risk-increasing factor to the Hungarian guard for the relations with the neighbor states as well.
"In the last months, the Hungarian guard was quoted in several neighbor states as a potenzielle danger source, the confirmation of its own antiHungary policy so sees some ultranationalistischer politicians of certain neighbor countries in the arising of the Hungarian guard."
That everything has effects on the political stability of the region "- it was called."
.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian guard with those of the Bulgarian national guard are comparable, the foundation of which was announced in August 2007 by the right extreme Bulgarian national union (BNU).
In the background of the Bulgarian guard's arising, the Roma mass riotings which took place in a district from Sofia (Krasna Poljana) were.
The BNU took the occurrences right to the cause for founding the national guard, with the argument that the objective of the organization the "national protection" is.
In your opinion, the state was however remained noticeable inactive and indifferent for years a regular "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria namely in the past 17 - Political Capital so.
And further: The initiative would have stepped away a violent debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said that the increased risk for ethnische confrontations is also proved by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organizations announced to found their own guard to resistance tacks.
Since the Hungarian guard's activities show many similarities to those of the Bulgarian national guard to date, it is not to be ruled out that the Hungarian Roma also react, with the organization of their own protection to the threats, it is been statement in the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, research director in the case of Political Capital said on inquiry of the report office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Risk analysis reports would be published annually and risk-changing tendencies should be recognizable, the public opinion is informed, as in the fall by handing over the Risikowarnberichtes.
Fixed days are not holidays everywhere
In Hungary, holidays are exactly regulated legally so that the procedure for the reorganization of the work days meanwhile was established all around the holidays, however the coming year of less such days give presents us.
In the EU as well and in America, one understands for something else by "holiday".
The Hungarian right system differentiates between state holidays and work free days.
Work free days are usually ecclesiastical holidays or are related to significant historical events.
We celebrate New Year as well, for example: Both the last day is can rest the old work free days - latter alone already thus the ones the that celebrate and the first day of the new year New Years Eve.
In the whole year, we have a total of fourteen holidays.
The state holidays are 15. March which reminds of the revolution of 1848 and 23. October, the intending day of the revolution of 1956.
On the 20. August, the state foundation is celebrated, on the 1. May the work, on the 1. and 2. November, we intend our dead ones.
Furthermore there are two holidays to Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a week-end, the procedure for the "work day shift" proved itself in the cases in which we would work only a day before or after the holiday.
The price of the lengthened week-ends is however that we must in front of that quite probably work on the Saturdays or must go to school.
When this day which fells before or after the holiday should be processed last finally, it has been established by the work secretary in its own regulation for long years.
The right regulation is likewise valid for all employers and employees, for public employees and civil servants of the public service.
Only companies and installations in which the business is continued without interruption, therefore also on the holidays, are excluded.
Pay is brought the work order something only by the holidays at the end of the year confused: The life stops from the 24. December positively in this country as most for the days take specially time adjustment or for that the this canceled vacation between Christmas and New Years Eves.
In the next year, more holidays fall into the week middle or on the end of the week so that there will be less Umdisponierungen at the work days, than this year.
The calendar is at first "put on the head" all around the day of the work in order that people can stay equal to four days at the piece home.
Saturday, the 26. April become a work day in order that the Friday, 2. May can be a day of rest.
The second Umdisponierung is connected with the holiday on the 23. October: On Saturday, the 18. October, one will have to process the Friday, 24. October first.
The end of the year will however be remainderloosely in the sign of the holidays after from the 24. December everything lies and stops even if New Years Eve fells on a Wednesday.
Six as a deterrent trifles in order to anger work colleagues
E mails that we forget to send, language reports that we never receive - harmless lies which do not at all strike ourselves more: They take "color" into the everyday life at the workplace.
The question is mere whether one gets used to these small bother or positions himself one the challenge better and attempts this misleadingly, for other angry situations intentionally to vermweiden.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to align for you that someone called of the marketing department" - a colleague says.
That one by this means neglected a meeting?
At best one regrets it and attempts to make up for it again by calling perhaps with the marketing department and admitting reumütig, one would have forgotten to align the report which is the less usual method).
.
Before one entangles oneself in embarassing excuses, one should consider with which what one can give and attempt its colleagues really unpleasant moments to avoid these situations intentionally.
Something lent what does not belong to one itself?
It scarcely gives something sinewy as if one grasps according to a document, Bürozubehör or the telephone, it is not however there.
Yesterday did the notebook device still lie on the desk - early this morning is it away?
Or does does become reveal believed ballpoint pens to this lost for example on a colleague's desk?
Without one should ask lend oneself nothing of the colleagues, for they are annoyed * if they determine that something got away.
Therefore, no envelopes or mail its from the office into the pocket put, for it could meet one itself: none there more if however needs man's immediately.
Getratsche over the colleagues' private life?
There is no effective means, a gossip which has already been put in the world to stop.
Who with whom, which made?
Where and why?
One should not tie for each to the nose if possible the information (or suppositions) on the colleagues' private life!
And if someone is however opened and betrays us its innermost secret, we should not misuse this trust!
The best one is as silent a grave instead of just not to align that present ones even if others know information as well about the problems of the colleague.
Reported without reason ill?
If one calls in the office in order to present himself ill with reference to tormenting headache because one feels just unwell or would only like to rest himself simply, one should realize one: The colleagues must now wear out its own work, unaufschiebbare treatments, projects with fixed deadlines instead of one itself.
The colleague therefore not übel participates!
If one already knows at the Vortag that one will not get it into the office on the next day or that something could interfere why one must stay home, one should report it on time in order that neither the colleagues nor the leader are confronted unexpectedly with the absence.
Hum, tittering, phoning
One is deepened just in its work but is disturbed suddenly by the loud tittering of the colleagues?
Unintentional a telephone conversation overheard that one better should not have heard?
One would not supposed to the colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations( that one holds beyond their heads), tramplings, constant scolding or moaning nerven.
That everything can be very disturbing even if they are not deepened right in a task (write, plan, organize).
Is the other always guilty?
.
If possible one should not make excuses on the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best one admits its errors for myself and excuses if others were affected by this as well!
The question how one make up for the error again which can make up neglected is only all too appropriate!
In the office - a feelings as home?
Training pants and Schlapfen: Nothing however lost comfortably home in the office!
Not once one should so dress oneself leger if the job allowed it really!
Become not too slovenly only - one both its colleagues and * as far as should respect that one dresses in the office accordingly - if desirably nicely elegantly, and!
Wants to prepare - or as one becomes uninteresting for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the all morning back-up.
A strange melody from radio erklingt: The sound of a violin, paired with electronic effects.
I turn volume high.
The pace changes, the bass comes to the previous sounds and as a real sound jewel a female chorus.
It is the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, that on mr2 erklingt.
The indigenous music scene did not just spoil us long time with qualitative Electropop.
However now one sees even the back-up differently if one hears the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the indigenous digital Underground scene contributes to changing the entire picture slowly and even if the garage skirt with its Gitarrengequitsche is "in" again who proves indigenous Electropop: There is what is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer began in Pécs, made music even in the band Yonderboi before he - perhaps because a landlord house tolerates no two whistlers - follow begin its own path.
He created the breakthrough with its project (Zagar) and its music which fuses elements from jazz, Electronic and pop but had approached him first as one with the request to compose the Soundtrack to a film (e.g.
"Szezon" of Ferenc Török).
The formation which had occurred originally in smaller clubs was known to the wider public first than magazine "wan2" aligned for indigenous albums under the Top 50 its first album from year 2002 and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, to the almost single Trendsetter kürte marketable also in the west.
Were Zagar and its bands "trendy" for doubt son, it however interested no whether they as well like to bear this brand.
The band reacted as it: With a new but better album.
The new album appeared now with title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open new paths for them however the title already expresses the wish for continuity with the Pécser years.
The print-out namely comes from the time, was still as a Balázs Zságer with another band on the way.
The breezy, flying allusion would be yes in order as well, however corresponding - louder guitar, the influences of the Rock'nRoll strike the one - the time spirit and the trends in addition to the ethereal character of music.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti working live in England and with the band "The Puzzle" imagined with the premiere in the Millenáris.
A song of the album managed it even to the radio hit - the mr2 Petofi transmitting since the whole day most recent pop music "this has for the listeners with number" Wings of Love", co-operating six indigenous singers ("Underground stars") one received, successive ones set the ear worm."
Everything in order therefore ().
The hvg.hu inquired of Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: To what extent does your music of a certain layer remain reserved?
Balázs Zságer: The concept "layer music" does not mean precisely a lot to me.
In my opinion, there are two boxes in pop music, that is not Mainstream and Underground or Alternativ and pop but rather commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative or Underground music can be shallow and empty, just as they however also only for the sale can be produced which changes them into commercial music.
.
The listener's receptiveness functions independently according to this principle, by languages and national boundaries as well.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and the foreign public in comparison with your music?
B. Zs.: Pop music has a greater tradition abroad, particularly to the west of us.
There not only teenagers or men in his twenties go to concert but also the older public.
They pursue the trends in pop music which happens round about them much more attentively because they consider them a part of the contemporary culture as well.
hvg.hu: What role becomes the public during work?
Is it important, who, where, hear how much your music?
B. Zs.: Naturally it is a good feelings to see that more and more come for our concerts.
We however never composed for the market.
In the case of us, music does not result in order to serve a purpose but rather for a certain reason.
The role of the public is usually marked with the concerts where there is already a reciprocal reciprocity but which there is again only in the ungreifbaren changes of the moment.
Nevertheless, one struck me: If you want to make it of all right, you are no longer interesting.
hvg.hu: How widely would you like to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He is as a soloist on the way and set up his career more in the west.
B. Zs.: We do not go its path really, times completely disregarded the fact that one attempts again and again, this into our music hineinzuinterpretieren.
We see rather than Teamplayer, the one in the musical presence of the other one trust and they unfolded.
Originally comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi unausweichlich were natural as several come to its band as far as we are concerned and took another route.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love "in first place" is in the Charts of mr2 Petofi.
Have heard many the name Zagar only this number.
Was the opening with a somewhat more popular style inszeniert in the direction of a wider public conscious?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit which should then hold out as a train horse for the album.
In this song, it is a matter of more.
It was intended as a finale of the album with which we wanted to dissolve the sound orgy and the somewhat more difficult subjects.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why was what just the guide principle? her what was the guide principle?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a Gospel well-behaved chorus.
Then the idea came to combine the chorus from gifted soloists of the indigenous music scene.
Thus sechsköpfige chorus resulted - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Eniko "Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh" therefore "-, we then baptized that apäter" Underground stars.
hvg.hu: Did you just as want to have the song or do have it the girls mitgestaltet?
B. Zs.: There has been the number for a long while in the instrumental version but however when the material was finished for the album, we imagined that this number still "needs something".
The Akkordenabfolge positively asked for a song voice.
I still sang in the melody in the same night, they learned the girls later.
Everything came practically alarmingly spontaneously at once and.
I can remember that I was considerable elektrisiert then, but it has already needed the "stars" as well.
With my voice alone, the song would have never become so strong.
hvg.hu: One had both on the record and with the concert however girls would be the impression, the one in the background.
It gives no solo Part (refrained from the short solo of Judy Jay), they have no own role, completely sing together and are not louder, than music, therefore their singing about music is not only accompanied.
They were on the arena as well rear.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: That they are stood at the rear was so because of purely technical problems.
However, we wanted to send no solo roles to them intentionally.
In the number, it is also a matter of this that one should forget its Ego a bit, forget who from where come and where on the way is, we allow simply that these certain wings, the wings of love emporheben us.
I would like that others as well feel this euphoric status that we felt when the song resulted.
hvg.hu: Which was the most expensive song?
B. Zs.: During musical accomplish work real of none at all it, more more difficult tasks set rather with the mixture.
For example with "Dorian Gray's dilemma" in which I play on a concert piano or in the case of "Rock'nRoll 'Goes To The Girls" where the Groove did not want to function longer, however gradually everything untied, as in the case of a Puzzle.'
hvg.hu: Which is your favorite number of the new album?
B. Zs.: That changes continuously with the concerts and also where I have album "losgelasssen" now.
Currently there are "prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and number "Never The sperm".
Because of less valency feelingses, deceptive broker risked billion
Bottomless swindler
Thus the French bank giant Société Générale, owner of the local Komercní banka calls its former employees Jerome Kerviel.
It namely came on his account about almost five billion Euro.
It however appears rather in such a way that Kerviel was only a large player who wanted to put it his colleague immediately, surely was not furthermore incapable.
In contrast to all large bank houses, he recognized the crisis punctually by the amerikanischenn mortgage market.
"He is psychically more weak," it was to be heard from the mouth of its superior who reported him to the police.
As is however apparent from statements Kerviels which published the French media, for example daily paper Le moons, he was a person who had achieved at the end of last year with its businesses profits amounting to 1,6 billion Euro.
Crisis not only in America
"Everything what he wanted, money was to be earned for my bank," he asserts in his statement.
In the summer, it had succeeded in profiting one half billion Euro right from the American crisis.
He had namely already spotted the opportunity in addition at the year beginning.
In February, there were quite first reports about that that so-called Sub Prime mortgages as they are given income weak customers or such which had payment problems already earlier, into difficulties would be fallen.
Influence on the entire economy should have this crisis however not.
Kerviel did not believe that and kept right.
At the end of the year, he had his profit high screwed except for 1,6 billion Euro.
"Had already as I this first half billion earned, I did not know as I should explain that," admit Kerviel and say further that he kept nothing definitive to himself.
During the entire interrogation, he admits that he forged documents, in order that one would not come for him to the tricks.
He even succeeded in leading his leaders behind the light even if the Eurex stock market was interested gradually in its businesses.
Risk profit
Did fear to fly up him?
Probably scarcely.
"I thought that it satisfies the simple fact that I earned for the bank 1,6 billion."
From where did he take the courage to risk so a lot?
He had to develop his position for himself gradually.
He stepped into the Société Générale in year 2000, direct after he had concluded on, his studying at the University of Lyon.
Its year salary amounted to approximately 51000 dollar.
After two years, he was already assistant of a broker and he of independent brokers with a year content of 90000 dollar became in year 2005.
Nevertheless, he knew that he will never earn as much as others.
"I knew already with my first conversation in year 2005 that one observed me."
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development, "explained Kerviel the investigation civil servant."
However the first large success came already soon after its entry.
With the alliance's shares, he earned lot of by having depended one half billion Euro on course loss of this title with the London bomb strokes.
And the release was that - now he wanted more.
Solang it profit makes, we leave you
"That is as a snow ball," he told the policemen.
However the leaders supposedly knew about everything or suspected it.
"As long as I earned money, schloss one the eyes."
However however then the great blow came at the beginning of this year.
On a single day, he all lost billion Euro.
On a week-end in mid January, he wanted to balance that.
When he came to work on Monday, he was employee of the bank no longer.
And the bank announced a couple of days later that it lost five billion Euro on his account.
And how did they come for him to the tricks?
He made suspicious for himself through a vacation.
"I took only four days of the previous year."
A broker who takes no vacation is one which does not want that one sees for him in the tickets, "Kerviel finally said."
Tschechien has the chance to come for 365 billion
Czech secretary and representatives of the European Commission signed yesterday a total of nine development programs through which the Czech republic can come to 14 billion Euro (approximately 365 billion crowns) in the next years.
It is approximately a matter here of half of the sum which can receive Tschechien in years 2007 to 2013 at all from Brussels.
Approximately 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programs.
.
Most money, approximately 150 billion, will flow into the traffic development.
The traffic program is the largest development program and includes up to 22 percent of the means that Tschechien from the fund can obtain.
This money increases the household of the state traffic infrastructure fund which will have 90,8 billion next year accordingly.
The program "enterprise and innovation" should serve for entrepreneurs and companies to gain money means for innovative undertakings.
The companies should by this means obtain finances for the introduction of new technologies, for enterprise research, but also for the introduction of more effective organization methods.
In the case of the previous money Aquisition from EU funds, Tschechien belongs at the least successful ones under the new membership countries to that to date.
Nicaraguanisches court confirms twenty-year-old custody punishment for ex-Presidents
On Thursday, a vocation court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year-old custody punishment for the former President Arnold Alemán to which he 2003 had been sentenced because of finance deception amounting to 100 million dollars (almost 1,8 billion crowns).
He had however been dismissed from the prison later and existed under house arrest on its Hazienda in the case of the nicaruanischen metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes again behind grating is currently unclear according to the news agency AP.
It will depend the chairman of the vocation court, Ileana Pérez, as a result of on the custody civil servants now whether one has Alemán sat out its punishment at home or whether he into the prison.
A court proved four years ago that, Alemán regularly, money of the government had shifted to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts belonged in reality for its and narrowest trailers used.
Percent of this money finally landed in a fund that Alemán had set up for financing its election campaign 2001.
Budget is through
Yes, it is managed.
The state household is endorsed.
What is what is special in this household?
It is the first household that this government designed and that was accepted without aid the opposition by the coalition majority.
This for the current year was endorsed still with support of the CSSD (social democrats) because secretary Sobotka (from this party) had presented him and the CSSD was not therefore able to permit itself rejecting him.
In contrast with the lively debating before the co-ordination on the mistrust application against the government, nothing dramatic occurred this time.
The appoint house endorsed noted this traditionally little, nevertheless most important law calmly.
That is so to speak paradoxical.
All ruling begins and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the household whether that pleases one or not.
.
That is a more grateful subject for the media and therefore they devote more attention to him.
.
The state households suffered at the past social democratic governments from than three weak points that the household for year 2008 can not at the same time remove:
In which case the first one it is not only concerns the high share of outputs which are obliging of law's the pensions but also about social outputs on which the "silent" coalition decided of CSSD and KSCM (Communist) in the last year before the choices.
The second one is the deficitary budget policy as a result of the first weak point.
The third limitation exists in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the local authorities.
The greatest risk is not however the state budget deficit.
This household is public and eingermaßen under control.
A true time bomb is however the budget deficit of the local authorities.
Many mayors gave in order to open up except takingses from taxes, taxes and bank credits further sources for investments, often debt orders mostly from by which they caused their city halls in the excess.
In the last years, they succeeded, with these debts by numerous sale of shares of the energy and other supply networks that they had received from the state in the train of the denationalization in paying off.
Now this source has already dried up.
As far as we adhere only to official and verifiable facts, we determine that:
our economy for some years as the remainder of the world, a growth phase go through, whose the CSSD is praised without Unterlass.
That represented a single possibility of their governments to take public finances into order.
Instead, these governments however involved the state @QD even more.
Other countries, apart from a couple of exceptions as Hungarians, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, economized a lot more rationally than our republic.
That is a giant disgrace which is to be attributed predominantly to the earlier governments.
We are among the countries which seen, in the global scale, are threatened at the least of poverty.
Therefore no nassiven social programs are necessary which were unfortunately blown up right in the last years completely superfluously in giant size.
Even if it was is successful clear, a part of the absurd populistischen outputs which were discharged this year before the choices to delete that if shifting the pension entry age and a pension reform does not take place soon, then practically every policy ends up in this country and, who is in power all the same, nothing will remain for him as a pure management.
It is exaggerated only easily if one says that then who will divide the largest part of the control takingses mechanically into pensions and social outputs of reigning politicians civil servants.
Therefore the this year's household can not be a revolution but rather can stop only the expulsion of normal outputs by duty outputs.
The deficit intended for 2008 of 70 billion crowns would be quite superfluous if earlier governments had not outputted in the last ten years, which only went.
If we do not want really to take place that pure administrative civil servants come from reigning politicians, then we must be patient and wish for this not all too greatest coalition government which he is is however as able to take conscious that the state can only output as much at taxes and charges, rest with the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these make possible a gradual enforcement of a balanced state household.
Jirí Krejcí
Banks want to cope with crisis
The American Federal reserve, the European central bank and the Zentralbanken Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the crisis on the finance markets.
Thus will reach the currency markets more than 100 billion dollars by means of auctions.
On these auctions, the banks auction interest sentences they himself are to be lent readily mutually money to which.
For example, the American Fed 40 billion dollars send on auction further 24 makes them loose for the European and the Swiss central bank.
There after the strokes of the 11.September, is the first time that the Zentralbanken of the individual states agree on such a coordinated procedure for the defense or Abmilderung of the consequences of a finance crisis.
"This step should remove the greatest difficulties of the economy, therefore" wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Baumohl from the consultation company Economic Outlook Group "the increasing lack of freely available capital that the banks can loan".
"The coordinated action of the Zentralbanken decreased from 65% to approximately 50% the probability of a recession in the USA," added Baumohl in its report.
The banks lost billion dollars because of not served credits already at 60, above all in the United States.
Analysts expect even further billion losses.
The Zentralbanken must have been afraid really of this, which can still follow everything when were decided on this procedure, "the leader economist said of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies."
"It appears that the situation is really bad," he said further.
The Zentralbanken have become the fear that if the banks have seriously themselves access to loans credits even more expensive for their customers.
That would decrease the consumption and the American economy rushes into a recession, possibly with effects on the economic growth in the entire world.
The Zentralbanken decided themselves on this after they had not succeeded Interbankzinssatz which is used with the money distribution between banks to in lower the so-called LIBOR the Londoner.
That means that the banks were afraid constantly to lend themselves mutually money that although the Zentralbanken of the USA, Canada and Great Britain had lowered their interest sentences during the fall repeatedly.
"That will as have the same effect a further Absenkung of the interest sentences," consulting told the agency Reuters Greg Salvaggio of tense.
Some Analysten are of the opinion that this step of the Zentralbanken toward warming up the crisis contributes because he does not solve the fundamental problem that is the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Debates of the ecologists are unglaubhaft
Global climate changes supposedly most damage developing countries.
President Václav Klaus commented on the problematic nature of the global warming again.
.
He executed in Vienna where he presented his book "no green planet a more in blue," that the debates of ecologists unglaubhaft are.
According to Klaus, the structure of conference inakzeptabel which forms a strange mixture of government representatives such and of non-government organizations but also the fundamental difference are not only between rhetoric that it accompanies and the reality.
"The debate there is unstrukturiert, it is is word fireworks, only the substitute for a real solution of present problems," told Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized when presenting its book that subject of this is very important for him and that he for that therefore like that engages him.
He expressed his contentment as well about that that its book appears in German translation because "I often strike caricatures of my views."
Now business prospects could therefore read its setting unverzerrt.
Klaus reminded that he is not a Klimatologe but he has for its opinion after sufficient requirements in order to write such a book.
He is finally graduate, able to understand professional discussions and to judge them, experience with statistics has and is people economist as well.
He described the thesis as a main statement of the book that the climate changes constantly and that its changes are therefore normal that there is no concurring opinion to the earth warming among the scientists that the consequences of the present changes are not all too large and serious and, therefore, no threat represented that to influence the efforts, the development of the climate, inakzeptabel is superfluous, ineffective expensive and.
Furthermore he holds it as someone which has experiences with totalitarian Sytemen to force other unbewiesene views for unacceptable, he regards that as a dangerous limitation of the liberty.
He repeatedly explained on questions of present ones he is not against "a rational environmental protection, but against militante ecological activists who take no consideration on the relationship between expenditure and return."
Klaus had already spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago in the Hayek institute.
600000 People one did not succeed in exchanging its driver's license
600000 Drivers neglected the set period of time in order to exchange its old driver's license, the validity of which proceeds at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where one can apply for the exchange, in order that the authorities manage to display a new driver's license to the end of the year.
The ministry however does not fear that driver goes following New Year hunderttausende without valid driving authorization on the roads.
According to the authorities, those did not exchange their driver's license principally which does not at all want to go more.
Report a great sinking of the interest in the Füherscheinumtausch while small places, the offices of the capital are showered with applications and the interest in the exchange still grew this week.
The city administration daily attends to 2000 customers around.
One must impend approximately a half hour.
In Prague, approx. 140000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's license.
The exhibition one of new driver's license lasts 20 days.
However it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shortened set period of time of five days.
The driver however 500 crowns dazuzahlen has to in this instance.
A fine threatens from January drivers who do not accomplish the specified exchange up to the end of the year and set off without valid driver's license.
The evil perpetrator pays at most 2000 crowns.
.
In the case of a violation, the punishment can climb on 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, that can also receive a punishment from the local authority imposed who absolutely does not go.
It was called for him, a punishment of even 30000 crowns threatens.
The ministry already called upon the offices to have mildness presided and to impose at most one punishment of 1000 crowns.
.
The driver's license is a document in the case of which each can decide whether he wants to possess it or not.
Every does not that is concern a personnel identity card that a valid one one, must have.
People which no longer want to travel should negotiate their driver's license.
It is sufficient to bring him to the responsible local authority office or to send him per registration there.
At the end of the year, driver's licenses become invalid which were displayed between 1964 and 1993.
The drivers must however exchange even further types of driver's licenses gradually.
People with driver's licenses from years 1994 to 2000 still have three years time for the exchange.
The validity of driver's licenses which were displayed 2001 to 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, is concerned this with approximately 2,6 million further driver's licenses.
Court reduces punishments for detectives who were allied to Berdych
The former policemen Josefs Opava and Petr Konarík which are charged with having made common thing from David Berdych with the company received custody 13 or 10 years.
.
12 years threatened the detectives the "office for the fight against the organized crime" 14 originally or.
There is no vocation possibility against today's judgement, only revision is possible at the uppermost court.
Berdych himself is to be sure also accused in this matter, however erstinstanzliche judgement lies ahead for him first.
With other processes, he had however already received punishing altogether 16 for years.
Too more he can not be condemned.
In January 19, a region court spoke to people fully above all because of participation in robbery raids, the upper state court negotiated the vocation of 16 of them today.
Most accused challenged from the beginning the accusation with the reason it concerns a constructed case.

The company for that left the booty Opava and Konarík 30 percent.
The accusation is concerned with criminal acts of the company from years 1999 to 2001.
Particularly about robbery raids whose sacrifices often suffered grave injuries but about office presumption and illicit weapon possession as well.
With house searches, the police discovered namely illegal pistols, ammunition with steel core, a laser objective telescope and a machine pistol.
The company enriched itself according to the accusation by their robbery raids at much million crowns.
Aside from beihnahe 20 men in this procedure recognized court Berdych and a series of others because of further robbery raids legal as guilty.
Further men from Berdychs circumference must answer for themselves in another process, further cases have not yet reached in front of the court.
Tomás Puta and Maros Sulej which are in Irish custody and wait themselves for the final decision on their delivery for the purpose of punishing pursuit in the Czech republic escaped the main hearing up to now.
Children interchange - calculation: 12 Million
For interchanging children in a dispensation clinic, the harmfully parents' attorney, Igor Veleba plus wants to demand indemnification court costs, from the hospital into Trebíc 12 million crowns.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children per one million.
The hospital offers at most 200000 for every parents pair.
The right representative of the hospital, Ondrej Dostál, is therefore entire with proposal Velebas and not in agreement.
"We reject such a proposal, he lies too high by a multiple," said Dostál after today's negotiation.
.
We will determine whether it has statement value himself.
We however insist on the view that that for all should be in the hundred-thousand area together, "emphasized Dostál."
The amount should range for him as a result of between 100000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablonov for every month that it had not raised its biological daughter, all wanted million crowns.
.
According to experts from the area psychology and psychiatry, the children's parents suffered psychic damage and stress symptoms in different strength and depth.
The men tolerated the stress situation better even if they faced accusations that they could have prevented the mistake the newborn ones.
The women again manage well with the aftereffects of the experienced trauma badly as well as also Veleba summarized the contents with that which just drains off now.
Nurses of the dispensation clinic interchanged Veronika and Nikola on the 9. December of last year in Trebíc.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Cermáks in Pribyslavice and Veronika to Libor Broz and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jablonov.
The region captain of the Vysocina (Bohemian Moravian height) had handed over resulted at the end of October every family 100000 crown as a substitute for outputs that for them through the error of the hospital in Trebíc that is subordinate to the region.
All hospitals in Tschechien are liability assured by law's.
In the case of doubt, they must grasp to a reserve fund, only as an exception they can apply for help in the case of the carrier.
The courts comforted person affected to date comparatively low compensation sums which amounts were determined by tables and moved in the range of hundred-thousands, as an exception of million.
Polívka came about its kingdom Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the fight about brand "kingdom Walachei".
He to be sure used as formerer designation "Walachischer king" for the judge in the region court in according to Ostrava, but a team had set up the project in long-term work about Tomás Harabis in co-operation with the actor.
Polívka did not participate in the negotiation today.
According to its attorney, the thing is not thus however probably concluded and its client will probably place vocation.
"The argument concerns this that Mr. Harabis and his team want to participate in popularity Bolek Polívkas parasitär," attorney said following negotiation Polívkas.
Everyone imagined this actor and comedian just in the case of words "Walachisches kingdom".
Harabis is also of the same opinion.
.
"He said" money obtaining and concepts of the activities.
The occasion is fight about money for him, as a result of.
"After years struck them that the project is successful and that they could have something as well from that."
They want to gain parasitär in our work, "he said further."
Lucrative business
According to the court used Polívka designation "Walachischer king" for the first time in one of its television broadcasts.
the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned 1993 him.
That was not however connected with the intention then to justify a fictitious kingdom.
Harabis came some years later to the thought to output walachische passports.
.
1997 agreed Polívka of the use of its name and its signature in the passports and offered its owners even reductions when visiting its farm and its theater presentation.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also led today that Harabis used only the bare idea which made Polívka public in the broadcast "arena" for its managerial intentions.
"Popularity Polívkas helped the project of the walachischen kingdom surely," said the judge.
It however added that the soul of project Harabis and its team are who would have devoted themselves to him intensively.
.
Since however began to accumulate the disputes between Polívka and Harabis, which culminated in the removal "King Boleslavs I. chosen up to the Sankt Nimmerleins day".
The guide role then took as a queen mother in right upon cause Harabiss Jarmila Suláková.
2002 then handed in Polívka the complaint against Harabis and its company that the court rejected today.
The competition prepared by Harabis could bring clarity in the argument about the throne and a half princess.
A new king should come from this.
He did not yet want to betray details and deadline.
"We want to rush nothing."
Something like that should be as the king move in the Walachei.
The king should be chosen for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka can make an appointment quietly, "added Harabis."
Test Peugeot 207 1.6 sw VTi: Voruteile fades
In order to say the truth that I was never a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not a lot worth, the quality of the gearshift, one was able to describe as rather sub-average for the control as well as the processing.
However now its successor, Peugeot 207 are, on the market and this is about much better.
The station wagon with the designation sw is another piece further and only remains for me to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic Hatchback of the 207, I had to complain myself for example over the head liberty that is too small on the rear seats.
There are now no longer these complaints, for the car body of the station wagon is formed in such a way that even two meter men will not suffer.
Quickly further
I go through the internal equipment only briefly in order not too very much to repeat me.
It concerns a rightly successful design where I have objections only because of the kümmerlichen medium tunnel.
.
The seats are comfortable and past are the times where we possibly complained about too short seats or head rests.
Even the side hold fundamentally improved in comparison with the 206.
Regarding the space offer, one can feel the enlarged measurements of the car body here as well.
In the station wagon, the lack that is already mentioned of head liberty is also remedied.
Suitcases in the trunk
The main point on this car is however the load room.
I (even because of the unfoldable reverse window) must describe that as very well loadable and space-saving.
.
They do not disturb, leave auseinanderziehen and establish even more difficult objects.
However, we talk about the drawer volume.
It amounts to according to table in basic equipment 428 liters, which is a rather average value in comparison with the competition.
However not in comparison with vehicle of this class best-selling in the Tschechien, Skoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare for the 207 sw with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we determine that the Peugeot stays behind by clearly marked 52 liters.
.
.
120 PS in four series
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder gasoline motor with lift area 1,6 liter and a performance by 88 kW.
And honestly, said, a 1600 Kubik motor should appear that a family Hatchback actuates.
He is low, has a small consumption and pulls away well.
If I compare him with its counter piece in the case of Skoda who sometimes affects than its exhaust with a rag would be stopped up, then I can only be inspired by him.
The price list says volumes
The price of this car is not just national.
But we must remember that we tested a well equipped car with a spacious Innneren and a very good motor.
The basic price of the car with the 1400er gasoline motor in height of 329900 crowns still concerns.
With our motor it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
Equipment Premium of the test car again hits with 80000 crowns in addition to beech.
We however had Kopfairbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper release, electrical window lifter rear and and...
Thus the car costs by and large simple 531900 crowns.
That is a lot, however the additional equipment of a Fabia adds up you once and you will arrive with a very similar sum.
Therefore only the decision remains what brand one wants to choose.
Integration of Slovakian student in britschen schools is not successful
The number of children from states of Eastern Europes gains in British schools, which causes native fears in the case of that about the further development of the local training essence.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans repels obstacles to date on a series.
British schools determine even cases where gains for arguments between the Zuwanderern and the children of the original residents in force activity.
The case of North Kent where the confrontations are increased gradually between the native and Slovakian Zuwanderern illustrates the problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in britschen schools aptly.
Streitereien, baffle plates and fights among students transferred themselves to the relations between the parents.
.
The accused defended himself by the boy having insulted them with rassistischen abuses.
The police had to intervene after attack two minor girls on a Slovakian Zuwanderer as well.
The girls had made rassistische observations vis-a-vis man alleged and pelted him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed upon a bus cottage and spat on us."
When I told him, he should stop, he pelted us with apples and pears and then stripped his seat, "times described a mother of Slovakian students of newspaper The a further unpleasant occurrence."
Complaints come from both sides.
One of of the native marked the argument with the Zuwanderern from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The led cases attest that the atmosphere becomes tenser and tenser between native and Zuwanderern in British schools.
In Great Britain 70000 Slovaks are reported who came to work search here.
British schools accordingly attend approximately 30000 Slovakian students.
Cuba - nicest island of the Caribbean
.
What you always expect from your vacation will be fulfilled if you only select the correct one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea which is quiet as a pond.
Palms and All inclusive with waiters who offer pizza, ice at the beach and of deceiving cocktail.
Kitesurfing, gulf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you find that in überreichlichem measure.
.
The Spaniard its bast ion for the capture of America was for Cuba currently.
Kolumbus called it the nicest place that saw each individual human eye.
Havanna became a warehouse once or passage warehouse of treasures that the Spaniards in America had robbed and then transported to Europe.
And then, the American epoch came.
The hotel Nacional completely resulted at the end of the 20. century.
Building left it one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, for everything that was considered a crime in the USA (specially during the prohibition) was seen with pleasure on Cuba and supports - drugs, luck play, prostitution.
Were among its guests among other things
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, high houses grew, over the wide boulevards of car go which were part of the cult symbols of the fifties of the past Jahrhundets.
.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, their signatures left behind cataract of the Showbusiness and politicians from the whole of America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita from Havanna, you too can leave behind your autograph.
At the bar in the hotel Nacional, one completely as desired mixes for you of cocktail.
And the cult cars of the fifties go around in Havanna until today because the Schigulis imported once and Fiats have already fallen apart in the salty and moist air for a long time.
Havanna, particularly its oldest part descend, heavily, one finds as many wonderful colonial sights in the circumference nowhere here right.
Other places become just herausgeputzt, for example Trinidad.
There was green light in regard after that that the tourism earns immediately necessary money.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels not only resulted in Havanna but also in Varadero, at the coast of the province Holguín and also on islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another caprice which is unparalleled in the world and attracts above all railroad lovers.
Steam and diesel operated narrow track courses brought the sugar pipe of remote plantations to the sugar factories.
Your car fleet was not repaired over decades and like that one sees there droll and fully functioning locomotives whose age accomplices are in the museum where else most longest.
Excursion destinations
The majority of the visitors Cuba's does not omit the meaning most ending places.
Thus one must no longer write about Varadero or Havanna in detail.
It is to be only mentioned that a museum is situated in the estate that is already mentioned Hemingways, the visit of which should be able to be escaped this author that, this, not.
The Viñales valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque angles of Cuba.
The luxurious vegetation increases to lime ground.
The Mogotas, lime hill and rocks tower steeply of the valley ground, in their hollow areas, fruitful ground collected through which even rock areas that weathered are covered by dense algae growth.
It is this valley where the perhaps best Cuban tobacco is cultivated.
In its final form, you can meet him if you visit one of the cigar factories of Havanna.
Possibly, it appears interesting too to some that there the Chilean consequence of the television series "Major Zeman" was turned.
Trinidad
.
Fame and wealth brought her of the trades with slaves and sugar.
The wealth personified in the trim beauty of the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influences by the later French settlers, scarcely changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, lain between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that there was still no road there in the fifties of the last century which would have connected the area with the remaining country.
This insulation contributed to its having remained unbeachtet.
Nothing was constructed there but even nothing therefore torn off, each was glad that he had a roof over the head.
If one has time for Trinidad more than one afternoon, then it is worthwhile to look at interesting places in the environment as for example the beach Playa Ancón or the "valley of the sugar factories".
In the evening one should then go in the Casa de la Música which comes to life following the darkness where music does not cease until the morning.
Baracoa
Some describe this small town completely in the East of Cuba as the nicest of the island.
Probably this view is influenced by the path as well there.
Both roads which lead of Guantánamo there must overcome high and zerküftete mountains and run through a countryside which is scarcely touched by human interventions.
The UNESCO included this eastern outpost of Cuba in its world heir catalogue thanks to the untouched nature there.
There the best chocolate is produced, in the church, one shows the cross of Kolumbus (it sprang up in reality hundred years approximately after one the journeys of Kolumbus) and from the hill, where the former castle, the present hotel El Castillo, is, several board mountains are to be seen of which El Yunque is the one well-known.
.
However, as one like that says: Look at better with its own eyes.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, assert Americans.
Influences the course of the mission for little too soldier and the mangle at necessary equipment, according to the United States in Afghanistan.
According to the words of defense secretary Robert Gates, the NATO should design a concrete plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan does not run after its presentations, the representatives of the countries were in agreement on this in the Scottish Edinburgh which stationed units in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of sides of the Taliban, the eight participating states discuss further coordination plans as well among the allies.
While the United States called up the NATO units for more activity through their Verteigungsminister Robert Gates, Great Britain sees the priority in the strengthening of the authority of the afghanischen government and in the intensification of the development aid.
"A forward development is marked in Afghanistan, but soldier power can be only a part to the solution."
A further part consists in making it possible for the residents to begin a further development of the economy and security itself, "the British Verteigungsminister of the Browne tells the BBC."
Ninety percent
According to data of the American army, the activity of the afghanischen Aufständischen has attained the highest state for five years.
The number of act of violence ions increased in comparison with the previous year about 27 percent, in the southern province Helmand even by sixty percent.
The NATO countries stationed approximately 40000 soldiers in Afghanistan, from that approximately one quarter in the southern territory.
.
They demand further helicopter, soldier and experts concretely for training the afghanischen units.
"We will have to continue to think about the concrete objectives for the next time and about the way how we can reach it," gates said.
Similarly the general secretary of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop commented today.
"I am not pleased about that what we have available in Afghanistan to country and in the air."
We have approximately ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment which is we bräuchten and that too little, "De Hoop of the agency Reuters said about the end of three-day conversations with the Japanese government in Tokyo."
Who is passive
Under the participating countries, argue also rules in the last months about this whether all allies in Afghanistan give her best.
Because of passivity, Germany was for example criticized.
"The Germans are represented relatively numerously in Afghanistan."
They are however stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of force and is as for us the fight requirements for them not so high in the southern and eastern part of the country, "said gates."
The British boulevard newspaper "Sun" described the German soldiers as rotten furs this week.
"Afghanische Nichtstuer enttarnt:" "The Germans make plays while our boy fights," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution which was supplemented by photos of German soldiers who play ping-pongs.
The German picture newspaper proceeded to the counter attack and printed a picture of a British unit with a rugby competition in the southern part Afghanistans.
Staatsschulden will shoot up trillion in year 2009 on one
Every Czech accounts for a state debt of 84000 crowns.
The entire debt climbed until the ending of September in 842,7 billion crowns.
The government had planned to cause itself with 159,2 billion cones this year.
At the beginning of December, the ministry however decreased the plan thanks to the better development of the state striking hold policy on 152,8 billion.
The Czech republic's Staatsschulden climbed until the ending of September in 842,7 billion crowns.
Within the first nine months of this year, they climbed accordingly about 40,2 billion.
Since June, they have however sunk about 13,4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its details about the Staatsschulden of the beginning of October.
Every Czech accounts for a debt of 84000 crowns.
By means of the entire past year, the state caused more than 111 Miliarden crowns.
"It appears up to now that we will cross the border of a trillion crowns thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year possibly first in year 2009."
Next year the debts should move crowns between 900 billion and a trillion, "said David Marek, analysts of the Patria Finance, server iHNed.cz."
It sees Vladimír Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance similarly: "We could come to the overstepping of a trillion in the course of year 2009."
When exactly, depends on the next household that we do not yet know.
If should become apparent that the situation changes at the political arena and the politicians should be to save readily more, that could last up to year 2010.
However I do not come from such a change, "he noticed."
Debts grow
The state debt comes from the debts of the state government and comes above all from the accumulation of deficits of the state household.
The state debt is financed by treasure instructions, state debt orders, direct loans or, for example, by loans of the European investment bank.
The domestic state indebtedness meanwhile climbed this year on 719,4 billion crowns.
The state's international debts meanwhile climbed about 1,7 billion crowns on 123,3 billion.
At the end of September 803,3, the so-called marketable state debt attained billion crowns and has sunk since June about 13,7 billion.
The average maturity of the Staatsschulden increased to 6,5 years.
"The entire debt increased over the year quarter from first to third about 13 percent, which is really a lot in the light of its how well it of the economy goes."
It is interesting that the growth is to be recorded above all with the debt orders where increment 20 amounts to percent.
It is bad that the debts climb but on the other hand this shows that one can undertake something, already before the pension reform comes, "commented on Pikora the data."
Better than expected
It comes from the financing strategy and the handling of the Staatsschulden for 2007 that the government for this year had planned to record 159,2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry however decreased the plan thanks to the better development of the state striking hold policy on 152,8 billion crowns.
This amount comes above all from the state budget deficit which will reach 76 billion crowns obviously this year instead of the estimated 91,3 billion.
A ten-billion reserve for paying the pensions concerns it at most planned means for the consolidation agency in height of 13,3 billion crowns further, the financing of Staatsschuldverschreibungen for 43 billion and about installment for the loans at the European investment bank in height of 1,8 billion.
For that, that she gave a Teddybären a name, it was presented for a court in Khartoum today.
After indicating their attorney, the British teacher who had been accused of insult of the Islam in Sudan on Thursday evening, custody and subsequent expulsion were sentenced to 15 days by a court in Khartoum.
The Briton was charged with having allowed six-year-old to seven-year students to give a Teddybären the name Mahomet although every representation of the islamischen prophet is prohibited.
It would have earned it to be whipped.
After parents of students had registered a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education and the Arts repeatedly, this was taken up on Sunday with himself home 54-year-old basic schoolteacher who was active at the Unity High School from Khartoum and accused according to article 125 of the Sudanese punishing law book of the insult of the Islam.
In fact, this matter takes its beginning in September when the teacher asks her six-year-old to seven-year students to select a name for the Klassenteddy.
The children suggest eight names, Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed under this", reports headmaster Robert Boules."
Finally, coordinates as the class, choose 20 from 23 children Mohammed as nicest first names.
Probably, Mohammed is the islamischen prophet's name, but above all also a first name very frequent in Sudan.
Next, the children prepared a book for the class, with the photo of the bear after that and the picture signature "my name is Mohammed".
.
.
.
One considers that first name Mohammed simultaneous also which in Great Britain at the zweit most frequent given second name is for which various styles exist in the English 14.
This first name selected often by moslemischen families is considered a type of respect in the prophets (he is frequently given a family the one first given birth to).
However how do the rules sound in the reference to the use of this first name?
May one give a toy him for example?
This is a question of the interpretation obviously.
On Wednesday, no agreement on the future status of the province took place when last negotiation being in Vienna.
The failure at the end
The Serbians and Albaner from the Kosovo concluded mornings Wednesday in bath, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without being able to overcome its controversies about the future status of the separatist province.
 It is regrettable that the parties were able to come to no agreement on the status", the European mediator explained to Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna."

The Russians who had already blocked the grant of the independence of the Kosovo with the security Council insist on continuing the negotiations beyond this final date.
Russia was and remains mediator of a negotiated solution, a one audible solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko."
One-sided independence explanation?
After the Kosovo was under administration of the UN for eight years, the western countries consider the independence the only solution with future under supervision by the EUs.
Pristina appears ready to announce this one-sided if the security Council should not decide its for favors.
Belgrade exists on more powerful autonomy
It was possible to meet Bedauerlicherweise no agreement", the President gave the autonomous authority of the Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the hotel in bath confessed, where these negotiations of the last chance" have been conducted "since Monday".

He however added that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to autonomy  to a past which led to murders and deportations.
Domino effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic was of the opinion for its part that a compromise is always to be aimed at and warnte before the consequences of a one-sided independence explanation of the province the Albanian majority from the Kosovo.
Belgrade means that it is still so very weakened this, by the independence wars of the 90er years specially a "domino effect" in a region fürchet.
 For Serbia does not mean that that a compromise would be impossible", he said."
.
The parliament of the Kosovo will have the last word
Only a decision from the series of the security Council is acceptable for Serbia", the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica explained."
These negotiations lasted two years.
In this way, they must end in the same way as they began: in the Sicherheitsrat."
Fatmir Sejdiu answered the journalists that  will have the parliament of the Kosovo the last word concerning the status "and added that every one-sided independence explanation of sides of the Albanian striking population " will drain off "in co-ordination" with the western countries.

He was "supported" by a second Spacewalker "which remained not far from the lock and, Peggy Whitson, Kommandantin of the occupation inside, of the other astronauts, among them."
.
When the action was concluded, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was completely aufgefaltet before he counted his tools and returned into the station.
The astronauts enjoyed yesterdays afternoon a half day relaxation before today seven astronauts returned onto the space ferry Discovery in order to walk up Wednesday the return flight probably to the earth.

The choice of status Quo
On Sunday, it will not become excite in the case of the Auszählung of the urns: United Russia will decide the mass of the Russians on President Putins party,.
After a very barred election campaign, it confirms to her for coal faces following stability, yes even to Autoritarismus.
Three days before the parliament choices, the Russian President Wladimir Putin directs a report radiated on the public transmitters to the voters which although has already been recorded, the contents of which are however kept secret.
.
Yesterday the President nichts looked through when he received the foreign ambassadors and settled for delivering a new attack point against the west controls which of the interference accuses favorite subject becoming its during the election campaign.
It knows the price of a genuine democracy and expects us honest choices extremely transparently, and open, choices without cheatings", he added."

The Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus for themselves
After these parliament choices without tension, two a lot continuing questions raise:
 Who will begin Putins succession as a President?
The office newspaper announced the date of the first electoral procedure of the presidency choices yesterday, the 2. March 2008; the candidates have time until 23. December to announce themselves.
Since he was chosen 2000 and 2004 re-electd, Wladimir Putin can not begin for a third mandate in sequence.
And now, no successor is found.
What role will play Putin after March?
Prime Ministers?
Chairmen's of the parliament majority and the omnipotent party united Russia which will select government and President?
What will always as well be it, will rejoice with the parliament or in the case of the presidency choices, the previous power.
That is tradition.
The Russians kept the mentality of the homo Sovieticus for themselves that they are not master of their fate "the sociologist Lev Goudkov thinks director of the independent center Levada."
The historian Nikolai Kopossov from the state university Sankt Petersburg even still goes back further: The middleclass society only developed further itself very slowly in this country which became five centuries to Europe christianisiert; the famous community spirit delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 90er years, Putin connected to the model of a paternalistic state again, which was completely accepted by the population, the more as no terror followed this new Paternalismus but rather a certain economic prosperity, Maria Lipman means of the Carnegie foundation.
Present  "Russians " dispense "voluntarily with the personal responsibility" that they put intermittently on the day after disintegrating the UdSSR.
To which still consider for a long time?
This phenomenon affects all society layers, including the business world.
And the administrative elite understands it to hold status Quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian region chairmen) lead the local electoral lists of the united Russia.
The new from which vests often are synonymous for coming liberties with chaos, as in the 90er years.
The public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not be correct for extremistischen parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: To which still consider for a long time?
Those who are in power are not so bad why they replace?

Does a final year Rally lie ahead for the stock market? Uneinigkeit in the case of the experts as a result of the US mortgage crisis
In barely five weeks up to the year-end balance sheet on the stock market, the investors already rub the hands with regard to the coming final year Rally.
Nevertheless, the experts can prepare no secure prognoses on this point.
Banif believes that  looks at purely statistically, the month is normally accompanied December by a positive marketing trend on the stock market
It is not Nichtsdestotrotz advisable to prepare prognoses at short notice and only on the basis of statistics. Above all, at the time when tensions to be taken seriously do not determine the current market occurrence
.
.
Javier Barrio, chairman of the sales department in the case of BPI in Spain, agrees by its being a dared time to announce a forthcoming market Rally.
The chances are not very well", assures the expert."
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum brand on the 8. November of 15.945,7 points.
However not all experts share the same negative opinion.
In the opinion of Juan Solana, Analyst in the case of Intermoney, the Ibex 35 could compete this traditional every year undertaken Bezuschussung of the pension cash-register, the year successfully for points as a result of the restructuring of the mutual funds and at this time with almost 16.000.
Nevertheless, the expert emphasizes that the things could develop somewhat differently this year; above all on the basis of this already in the second week in December and accordingly directly after the bridge day to the day of the state, taking place final year Rally.
According to the Analysten, the price variations would not influence the market tendencies.
.
The Analyst trusts in this that these turn out to be positive.
With the selection of the values which should accelerate the Ibex to new maximum measures, the Analysten are united.
Solana of Intermoney declares that "this year the large values are."
The expert would be the two Großbanken and some real estate societies among the value winners, since the current sector its wird." too expensively at the given time
Währenddessen assures Federico Olucha by the bank Inversis that the rises will go around in connection with the bank and industrial sector.

Popular will Mondays Fridays have opened its 200 credit institutes 12 hours on the day.
Popular decided to modernize a large part of its branches.
Altogether 200 from that is settled in the economic strongest regions of Spain.
These branch offices mean a large milestone to the institute which operates on max. under the brand name Popular.
Also, however, for the remaining Spanish institutes, since Popular as a first bank group represents dares the leap to lengthen the opening hours of its branches wochentags to 20.30h and Saturdays to apply them from 10h to 20.30h.
The bank group BBVA which is repeatedly reported the extension of their opening hours as well lies in the branch offices, still made no definitive decision up to now.
.
Lie adjacent further banks of the new initiative, for the business opening hours anpasst, will depend on the empirical values of the Popular bank.
And that is just the intention that Popular pursues with its project as well.
It is the objective to lengthen the opening hours of those branches that even which of large department stores can, but cover the purchasing gay clientele of independent, small and central enterprises on the basis of its situation.
The bank would like to open the new 200 branch places in the course of the coming 18 months as it concerns not new but changed opening hours.
For that, the bank will alter the rooms of those branch offices which are already situated in business zones and adapt them at the same time to the individual customer profile of the various zones.
Thus the expansion of the opening hours is connected with a new space design of the branches which are distinguished through a more current, more colorful design.
.
The branch offices which will be equipped even with additional rooms for the KMU will sell no financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has tried its concept already over nine branches in Madrid.
And the empirical values fell out positively, so Ángel Rivero.
The branch offices of the roads bravo Murillo, O´Donell and grain Vía were selected for that, what appears to have been a clever resolve.
Popular manages approx. 2500 branch offices momentarily.
And further 60 which operate on under the name Mundocredit. These specialize in immigrants and have expanded opening hours as well, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of the BBVA is not used as most of them instead will offer a wide selection to non-finance services for the sale.
"We would like to represent no competition for our customers", explain Rivero.
With Telefonica, they came preliminary to the agreement to sell mithilfe of externally bank personnel mobile phones.
The Spanish private transmitter Telecinco doubles its stock market value for the first time and therefore overtakes its rival Antena 3.
"We managed it."
With this sentence, the general manager provided of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, with stock market end its contentment kund. The transmitter led by him had increased its value about the dual of its rival Antena 3.
.
He emphasized that they in spite of the weak market did not "all too sink deep."
Telecinco concluded yesterday the day with a plus of 2,54%.
This profit diminishes its previous this year's losses on 15,66%.
According to data of Bloomberg, the company value reaches now 4.488,88 million Euro in which case Mediaset is checked the main share of capital (52 %) and Vocento is involved only with 13%.
The rival Antena 3 lost 1,52 percentage points yesterday and has to register a loss of altogether 40,5% since January so that its market value with 2.193,46 million amounts to half.
The market value of other stock market noted communication enterprises by contrast climbs; in the case of Sogecable on 3.571 million, in the case of Prisa (publishers of the magazine Cinco Días) on 2.518,53 million and in the case of Vocento on 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be derived from the fact that it "acts two similar enterprises *", according to Vasile.
Ungewiss still appears the question to what extent we can in fact act stock market technically at what price and such as we it at the customer level lucrative can make.
Telecinco declared its project a week ago that it rose to the first television transmitter with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising takingses this year. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the general manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the advertising enterprise of the group.
If the project should be turned over, the transmitter would increase by 3,6% its advertising proceeds in comparison with the 965,4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, the net turnover increased by 1,6% in the first nine stock market months (up to 734,4 million) while the net proceeds from the television business were able to have only a rise of 0,7% (630,4 million ).
The Analysten see the main factor for the one in the comparison better stock market course of Telecinco in the case of the high Payout Ratio that the company was able to have up to the present time: 2006 caused a 100-prozentige dividend distribution the enterprise managed by Alejandro Echevarría.
.
"We are obliged for the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares even if we up to now always fundamentally stated more."
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, we were already able to increase the share values of which by purchasing 33% of the Endemol shares.
After statement of the Analysten, the market has certain loss tendencies currently.
Lehmann Brothers reduced its profit calculation recently by 4% first in the case of Telecinco for this year and for 2009 by 7%.
This is the result of the reduction of the probable increment which will diminish 2008 from 10,5% to 8,4% and 2009 from 5,5% to 5,1%.
This reduced the probable profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 as well by 4,5% and for 2009 by 7,5%.

* other sources of information report about the supposed order payments Morales to a Galician building enterprise which provided for the conclusion of a town architectural contract in which the development a 200 hectare large area was decided.
Currently eight people sit in investigation custody.

.
Thus José Blanco, organization secretary of the PSOE and Bono in the press conference announced it after a meeting with Zapatero took place today in the headquarters of the party.
According to the head of government, the offer to the former secretary is justified as it is important in the policy  to be able to count on the best ones "and Bono  is under the best ones."
In addition, the politician coming from the Mancha would become in the case of a victory for the socialists with the coming choices  according to all appearance "as a chairman of the congress for the party kandidieren."
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as congress Presidents. This had announced on the past 15. November no longer to begin with the next general choices, to conclude his career in the public policy and instead to support the climate protection in the university area.
The former secretary had to admit that the government President would continuously have insisted on the political occurrence two years ago on its return since his resignation.
.
If he should in fact assume the office, he of "which of respect and not the insult or the shouting" hopes to change the chamber into a "house", so always appears similar ones to the citizens about them to lassen."
"One gains Bedauerlicherweise the impression from time to time as if the only place in which one can not speak quietly and left in Madrid, the congress are; thus the government President was interrupted in the senate once up to 26 time."
At the same time he would praised call the current President Manuel Martín and  his good work "and indicated that he does not want to wake the appearance already to have assumed the office, since otherwise its political counter players this as a Arroganz".
Climate propaganda
.
Above all, if it concerns a leader of the movement for the one as considers in the case of government President Zapatero, important than the combatting of the islamischen terrorism the fight against the climate change and even suggests "signing" a new contract with the planet.
This proposal however brings him into explanation need concerning acting or non-acting its government that contributed decisively to Spain being within the EU at the head of the countries which fulfilled the guidelines of the Kioto protocol at the least.
Who the persons responsible for the non-fulfillment of the guidelines are, to what sectors this is to be attributed why its government that contract with the planet had "proposed did not stop this development."
In addition, he is now compelled, the Spanish citizens who planned to explain measures of him against the climate change without beating around the bush.
What companies from that will be affected what behavior of the citizens should be changed what individual and collective saving measures one must carry out and what economic sequences result from this.
I.e., who has to be sacrificed and will pay for the rescue of the planet.
However, it has and there will be no such explanations in the future.
Straight line because it of the sacrificing and the payment is a matter.
For the measures which can be begun in real terms against the climate change are unpopular.
They are costs rich threateningly and for the accounts of the companies and citizens, unbequem.
The gasoline cent proposed by the PSOE even appeared seen Zapatero electoral strategically to such an extent dangerously that he saw him compelled to retract the proposal again.
It is now necessary accordingly therefore to save real consequences, with pure propaganda and empty sayings without each the planet with zero.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new offices.
With his contracts with the planet the politician suited so otherwise for electoral campaigns must neither speak nor accuse still demand, instead however follow the exacting output to decorate this for hits and to impress others with its gentleness and quality.
This can however occur only when the contract does not deviate from its purely virtual nature and, accordingly, does not claim that the bicycle becomes in the future the single fort movement means or we may refresh ourselves only with one of fields.

But if you rob wiederrum a music business under a value of 400 Euro, this is considered only a simple violation (articles 623.1).
B. If you rob the business up to a value of 1000 Euro, then the theft to be sure becomes as criminal act classified, nevertheless the punishment fells from more smaller than in the case of a Download (articles 234 punishing law book).
C. If you steal a car and return it again forty hours later, then the punishment still is smaller than in the case of a Download (articles 244.1).
D. One must participate less gravely in a brawl as at a music data exchange.
To participate in a rebellious confrontation involves a prison punishment for months from three to 12 (article 154 punishing law book) while the data exchange results in a liberty withdrawal of six up to two years in months

What insurance is suitable for me the best?
The vehicle insurance which covers a possible claim caused by the driver includes among other things by age, sex, time of the generation of the driver's license a high expenditure whose height wiederrum depends on various factors, family state, type of the car to be assured and its utilization, etc.
Only the beginning is to be possessed a car.
For the suitable vehicle insurance can be found even more difficult as the correct vehicle model.
It must be clear to one first of all with which which we have to do it here.
.
.
.
The insurance enterprises determine their prices statistics accordingly so that, in the event of a higher accident danger, even higher contribution payments become due.
For this reason fewer contribution payments must make both via 25-year-old and women, for occupy statistics that these groups have a smaller quota of accident thanks to their caution.
The same is also valid for married people as these incline after statement of the statistical values as alone being one and, accordingly, also after convicting the enterprises, fewer too accidents.
.
The more frequently the utilization, the more probable one the damage.
.
For this reason the driver must also study the situation thoroughly in order to select exactly the autoinsurance which soonest caters to its personal needs.
.
These among 25 year-olds strike numerous obstacles with selecting a reasonably priced insurance, such as, e.g., the small driving practice and the young "driver's license."
.
The cautious drivers can select a full hull with self-participation so that the performances of a full comprehensive insurance are to be sure covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount that resulted by the damage himself.
"The amount is established before concluding the contract and based on the level of the insurance premium." "This is higher the sum to be paid per small", Luis Noguera explains main representative of Spain in the case of peak Europe, a mediation enterprise for on-line insurances.
Another option is not however the expanded insurance which insures the customer against external accident damage against the damages that resulted at the own car.
In addition, this type of the insurance would cover theft, burning and vehicle loss.
Here a Council.
If you are old under 25 years, it lies to lower in your hand, the insurance costs; your credit increases by attempting, go cautiously too and to avoid accidents.
A credit is a decrease in the basis tariff at the corresponding insurance society.
.
"The height of credits and punishing payments depend on the society and its returns."
If the enterprise has a return rich year behind it, can permit itself to increase the bonus payments", Noguera explains."
As soon as the 25 year record has been surpassed, it is to be concluded a contract for the drivers more simply. The fact is reason for this that with increasing driving practice the quota of accident sinks.
Therefore it is the most sensible to decide on a full comprehensive insurance with self-participation.
.
Nevertheless, it is at a married customer site who possesses no children to conclude a full comprehensive insurance more advisably; naturally only when it also allows the corresponding person's financial situation.
On the part of the underwriters, married couples with children are considered the customers with the smallest quota of accident and their contribution payments also fall out accordingly low.
.
"They travel altogether relaxed and" Luis Noguera "possesses" determines, "a greater purchasing power which permits them applying a higher contribution payment".
.
One must record last finally that the autoinsurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accident damage but also because it recovers high costs which require it that a thorough selection is made which of our personal situation corresponds.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes for the point for the dividing into eighths finale in Milan
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will fight on the next Tuesday in San Siro for the point that they lack in order still to reach their respective objectives before concluding the Championsleague preliminary match. The Italians need to arrive the point about at the point of their group, during these, decide on their participation with the bulkheads.
.
The two plays of group D will take place a week before the end of the sixth play round as the FC Milan at the FIFA club world championship must begin in Japan where he will fight at the 13ten in the half finale for the first time for the entry into the finale which takes place at the 16ten.
Thus this group will be concluded before all others and the Unentschieden in the Guiseppe Meazza stadium to the result expected on all sides even if both teams will attempt to win. The Italians become at home namely not the Keltik Glasgow does does not not want to speculate know which would become them group formerer in the case of a victory and in order that would have a better exit position in the dividing into eighths finale.
A defeat suffices to qualify for the team of Gordon Strachan even when blowing the FC Shakhtar about itself. Nevertheless, he should not all too very trust in such circumstances, for the Ukrainern the participation is entitled to parity in the case of nine points; these had to be sure lost last week in Glasgow (2 1), but were able to win at the second play (2 0).
Accordingly, the Milaneses will therefore attempt, the bulkheads the evening to vermiesen. The wiederrum hope to attain the dividing into eighths finale of the altered Championsleague for the second time in sequence after they were defeated at the vorrangehenden play season in exactly the same round by a gate by Kaka at the Nachspielzeit (1 0) and through a zero too zero Unentschieden on the Hinspiel.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the "Rossoneri", the team will have to concentrate on its own play as both the attainment of the dividing into eighths finale and its membership in the case of the UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could gain the third place in spite of its lower table position and without the view to be able to continue to participate in the greatest European championship by a victory and, therefore, play a part in the UEFA.

New fears on natural gas argument between Russia and the Ukraine
A new price argument smolders between the Ukraine and Russia, which increases the danger that Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe are impaired.
The largest part of the Russian natural gas exports into the European union (EU) is led by the Ukraine and every argument between the two nations is observed very exactly.
Kiew in front of that has gewarnt if Moscow increases the price that it must pay for the natural gas, it of Russia will send a bill for higher transit charges.
.
.
According to Gazprom, one must more compute for the Ukraine as the concern arranged to pay additionally up to 50% for natural gas from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Say Analysten that this could mean that Ukraine must pay 40% for the imports of Gazprom more.
"It is important to use for us, our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states with conversations", the minister of commerce of Ukraine told the news agency Reuters Anatoli Kinakh.
"The fluctuating natural gas prices should be connected with our arguments doubtless concerning the height of the transit charges [to Western Europe] above the Ukraine."
Gazprom deliveries into the Ukraine shortened in the last great natural gas argument between Moscow and Kiew in January 2006.
This led in sequence to a case of the exports to Western Europe, which drove the prices drastically up.
Russian gas turns off a quarter of the supplying of the European union.
Russia has this worldwide greatest gas occurrence, but a lot from that remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom supplements for central Asiatic former Soviet nations its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other.

The climate on the Venus could reveal a view on the future of earth
The Venus was perhaps a pleasant place once for the life, said scientists yesterday.
.
The Venus is the näheste planetary neighbor of earth.
The two worlds possess approximately the same size and have similar planet courses, however the Venus of the sun is somewhat nearer.
Before billion of years would have reigned on the Venus conditions which would have been very similar to these on the earth and could have been even inhabitable, believe scientists today.
However because of the ungebremsten coal dioxide hothouse effect, the erosion of atmosphere through solar radiation and a slower rotation pace, the Venus pursued a quite different development course.
Today the planet of water is robbed and has a surface temperature which is enough heiss to melt lead and is devastated by Hurrikan strong winches and lightning storms.
The realizations of space probe Venus Express of the European space travel agency which investigated the Planten for a year offer a sobering up look at as the earth could develop in the light of that of catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the department physics at the university Oxford shirting, one of the director of the Venus Express mission, said: "It becomes clear why the climate was is like that different on the Venus to that of earth while the planets are otherwise quite similar to themselves."
"Our new data make it possible to construct a Szenario in which the Venus began before billion of years as the earth, possibly with one of habitable environment."
"Enriched uranium" confiscated by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, according to reports enriched uranium, was confiscated yesterday by the Slovakian and Hungarian police.

Everything still openly
Mitt Romey said that he does not keep it worthy of a presidential candidate to be asked by a snow man.
In spite of this, the republican candidate declared himself the presidency in the end readily to stand for a debate on YouTube in which normal voters receive and hand in questions on Video in order to send the candidate them.
None of the questions, this on the Wednesday evening, the 28. November, was raised, was as ridiculous as the snow man, questioned the democrats about the global warming in the YouTube debate of the other party.
However the questions and the answers reflected this time the status of the republican party exactly which breaks up in the choices in the next year.
It is not known just so the producers of CNN that the debate mitunterstützten which selected the beginning candidate of YouTube clip to be shown.
.
The subject is one of the blow strongest subjects for republicans.
The CNN asked to manipulate a group of unentschiedenen voters a choosing disk if they heard things that they liked: The television institution noticed spoke points of the agreement severely as the candidates via the borders.
The sharpest and exchange longest of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national outrider and Romney which pushed in the decisive inquiries in Iowa and New Hampshire to the front.
Giuliani attempts to shake off the call, he was flexible with respect to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in that he the former governor of Massachusetts charged with having set illegal immigrants for working on its house.
.
It was successful more insignificant candidates such as Duncan Hunter, Californian congress representative and Tom Tancredo, a congress representative from Colorado, in the case of this subject nachzuhaken.
Neither of the two men have serious chances with the nomination, but perhaps both remain in the racing, because they earlier and harder than others struck on the immigration bass drum.
At least in the area of the immigration, the candidates divide the same views by and large: sharper borders, intolerance in comparison with illegal Migranten.
Help to forget or to minimize this subject, together with fears via poisonous toy from China or other worries over the remainder of the world, for the republicans the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
However the debate was became brought problematically as other subjects obviously for the language.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he supported weapon restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed this whether simulated drowning should be regarded as a torture.
One of the question regulators asked whether the candidates believe every word of the Bible.
This led to the result that Giuliani represented the point of view that although the Bible is its preferred book, he does not perhaps believe literally the story of Jonah and the whale.
A further question regulator asked whether Jesus would support the capital punishment.
.
When he was pushed for this whether Jesus would support it, he laughed about this and was said Jesus too intelligently for himself to apply a political office.
The racing remains open extraordinarily.
Huckabees rise in Iowa fells for most recent contribution successes and its approval storms together with Ron Paul in the debate of Wednesday.
These two are high shot from the zero because the two wings of the party were to date not yet able to agree on one of the more well-known and more traditional candidates.
In year 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party with conviction with a victorious message over the size of America and a blinking from the beginning and to both wings of the party.
The party is split this time and the result is not at all clear.
Hurt of the Labour party
Gordon Brown discovered another further hole to the Hineinfallen; its path from this this remains same *.
For British scandals, this is not specially slippery.
No nobility titles seem sold, Parisian pays no politician for hotel calculations to have been sucked no illegitimate toes.
However the Aufdeckung that a rich businessman disguised over four years under the name of other people contributions to the British ruling Labour party over more than 650.000 pound (1.3 million dollars) and that the party neglected to report this, is would somewhat have gotten along without that of the umkämpfte Gordon Brown well.
When two months ago the minister-president had avoided the demand for a choice, the intelligence of the Britons insultingly in dämliche way by having asserted that opinion inquiries would not have influenced this decision, there was hope that he would offer a sturdy, efficient government.
Instead, such as Vince Cable, this in increasing measure sharp ingenious representation chairmen this liberally democrats, it expressed, the Brown feared once developed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of Northern skirt, a hit bank, showed regulatory weakness and bad judgement capital under fire.
Bad set proposals for the change in the control laws thought through have enterprise associations against the government.
The control official loss of individual data of 25 million persons demonstrated unvorstellbare administrative Pfuschereien.
A trio of generals in the retirement started for a rebellion in the upper house from protestation against reductions of soldier outputs: To be secretary of the armed forces, they asserted, a part time job is.
Now there are the diverse contributions of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, Labours general secretary (and their former fulfillment director) have already stepped back.
Nothing from that means that, Brown irrevokably, direction breaks up withdrawal.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a turning point according to which they feel it impossibly to rule.
Neither like nor does people trust politicians, however do they normally hold back their scepticism if a new troop takes the office.
If it is clear once that it is improbable that a Prime Minister improves the situation and he does not yet need be once for a long time, this opening past: the public service begins become undicht; begin the cabinet secretaries chat; the press looks for bad reports; and the government becomes defensive and objectiveless.
In a manner, the position of Brown is specially difficult because he can not assert in contrast to other political leaders that he is a new broom.
He Tony Blair would so like to deny, he was his upper second lieutenant.
The problems with Northern skirt and that control competence documents, for example, hang together with decisions that Brown made as a chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if this the voters were do not not possibly involved come directly in Blairs misfortunes - as in the case of the long "money for nobility title investigation" of political party financing - from this that he was it.
In spite of this, Browns situation is not completely so bad, looks like them
The offenses are not as awful as the conservatives describe it.
As, in the case of Mr. Bean, no one died, or was cheated completely.
And the antidote, painful such as it is, it is to be delivered, which stalinistische tendencies always promised Browns naturally: A reliable sturdily and slightly brutal government.
The new fuss about political contributions is a good example.
The garboeske Abrahams which compares its contributions with its gifts beneficial to the public says wishes him no public recognition for its well disposed.
That perhaps like that is but he was not entitled to the decision on this.
The laws against Anonymität for large political contribution payers are clear and they exist for a clear reason: the public has to know a right to that who can buy for himself access to this which rules the country.
Watts known which would says have him about Abrahams arrangement but not that it is illegal, will have to position itself some questions obviously; just so Jon Mendlesohn, Labours main finance one drivers which was told over the separate contributions in October.
However up to now Brown is not involved: There is nothing that after that indicates that he knew about these confusions although the largest part of the payments was made after its office takeover in June.
Up to now the Prime Minister accomplished half of the work.
.
In this instance the "teachings to be pulled out of" this are not very much complicated.
If the law was broken, it is a thing for the police.
Aside from the fact it must gives make other things Mr. Brown how to find something a permanent chairman for the independent committee for standards in the public life who has been vacant for six months and to advance with a drastic reform of political party financing.
That would become requires to co-operate of the Hardlinern of the Labour with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relation with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party accomplice such as Mr. Brown.
However he should be conscious of some partial facts.
The conservatives have a clear direction now in the opinion inquiries; he has to regain two years about voters; and the only path as he can reach a victory is through unanfechtbare Rechtschaffenheit and sturdy competence.
Ticket sharks
Does America's Kreditkartenmarkt credit crisis infect?
If blood is in the water, it is is only natural that back fins spin around excited.
Now where of America real estate market kränkelt, the predators have the Kreditkartenmarkt of the country in the sights.
Count Analysten of Goldman Sachs on the Kreditkartenverluste 99 billion dollars being able to attain if the infection danger of lower financed credits spreads to other forms of Verbrauchenkrediten.
Signs of the exertion are clearly visibly.
There are rises both in the case of the Ausbuchungen and in which case installment of dilatoriness which measure the share of the credits which are not in each case drawable or more than 30 days too late.
The HSBC announced in the last month that it took a 1,4 billion dollars partially, because of the weakness of Kreditkartennehmern charge collection from their American consumer financings.
It is nevertheless too early to lapse into panic.
Losses and dilatorinesses still are low.
According to the Ratingagentur Moody, the third quarter Säumnissrate was almost a full percentage point of 3.89% below the historical average.
The worsening in the case of that installment can be explained in part by technical factors.
.
The industry also reports about sturdy payment installment which shows as the consumers pay off a lot every month of their debts
and the trust in kreditkartenbasierte value papers is quite great, in spite of the immobilization in other corners of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research enterprise, counts on the output volumes for 2007 being 25% higher in the end than last year.
There are probably direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the Kreditkartenmarkt: it is more probable that consumers Kreditkartenschulden receive, now that egg gene home credits dry up.
The ticket exhibitors however look at the money river instead of on capital values therefore falling house prices not necessarily do not initiate a change in the Kreditwürdigkeit of the Kreditnehmers.
They can be of advantage even for the ticket exhibitors.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay the mortgage installment, sink if the real estates are less value than the value of the loan; as a result the ticket debts become more important under the refund priorities.
Ticket exhibitors can react a lot as well to the more boom conditions quicker and more flexibly than credit givers by changing interest sentences or credit borders.
That should reduce the risk of a quick new interpretation of the Vermögenswerte theoretically.
"We will not awaken of a day and the loans completely re-assess", says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones main finance reporter.
Even if a sudden Unterdeckungskrise is improbable in the Kreditkartenmarkt, the risks of a nachhaltigen sharp bank are considerably more real.
If lower house prices and a credit decrease push America into the recession, the industry will stand before a grimmigeren future doubtless.
It of wide Ausschau has held to measure these shark fins.
British Bänker confess fully in the case of Enron
On Wednesday, three British Banker which should be placed for their role in the deceptive system with the former main finance director by Enron, Andrew Fastow, before the court changed their requests in guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally for seven cases of deception using telecommunication means for the alleged Konspirieren with Fastow in a secret finance deception in year 2000, to be enriched itself at the expense of their employer, pleads on innocent.
The procedure had been applied for the January.
However during a hearing before the court before US district judge Ewing Werlein junior, each pleaded for a case of deception fully using telecommunication means.
The three former managers of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Great Britain in the course of delivery procedures which lasted two years.
.
.
The accusation against the Banker - the "NatWest" named "three" - asserts that they came in year 2000 to Houston in order to hatch one deceptive plot with Fastow and its former Topberater Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a daughter society of a partnership of Enron which was checked by Fastow who was the architect of innumerable deceptive Enron machinations which contributed to tearing the company into the bankruptcy swirl.
Beginning 2002 had estimated the bank the value at zero its participation in the daughter society but knew the three British men that it had considerable value in reality.
.
The bankers paid Kopper 250.000 dollar for a participation in this enterprise.
According to the accusation, Fastow replaced falsely in comparison with Enron that, the energy enterprise 20, million dollars would pay to Greenwich NatWest for their shares in the daughter society.
However in fact 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars while Fastow, Kopper and others skimmed approximately 12.3 million dollars, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed fully in two accusation points upon conspiracy for its role in the Enrons bankruptcy.
The British trio was apprehended three months later.
Fastow sits out a 6-year-old prison punishment in the federal prison of Louisiana.
.
Each of the three men was million dollars securities which made it required that they lived in the United States in expectation of the legal proceedings on free foot on the basis of a 1.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest enterprise, cerium crumbled in the bankruptcy in December 2001 after the billion debts were no longer able to disguise years of bookkeeping tricks longer or schwächelnde undertakings were able to appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron founder Kenneth Lay and the former executive board chairman Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year of their roles in context with the Enron collapse.
Skilling sits out a punishment of more than 24 for years.
Lays convictions of conspiracy, deception and other accusation points became futile after he died last year because of heart affliction.

"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - therefore we are all here", told a London jeweller Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris.
It had visited for the first time together with the Russian vendor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group, the fair.
"The women are maintained all exemplarily and the men are all a capital worth."
While they pull Sunday night in evening clothing through the halls, two real estate brokers, Evgenia Yumatova, 21 and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, * and their clients describe as millionaires.

"It is interested naturally for soots in jingling Klimper more."
Indeed the vendors say here that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years is old according to Russian standards) have already moved from großspurigen Logos to the type of sober delimitation with limited numbers of items which would not market in the case of a trade show.

"He will preserve it garage in its 30 or 40 cars."
Even if many of its Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said, phrase "Russiche millionaires" would not express much exclusivity momentarily, in the light of the increase in the local real estate prices.

Bungled operation supposes with case of death in New Jersey
.
Soon after that a police car was there.
And then, what is a further was there.
"Then I saw approach the medical body inspector's box car", said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was knew the point as I that someone had died."
.
Now, the investigators attempt to determine whether it died because of a procedure which was not practiced allowed by one kosmetischen surgeons of whom the police identified and who did not work in the house at the west Scott Avenue 212.
What the authorities do have not yet not yet have caused determined Ms. Arroyos death and are hopeful that toxokologische investigations could be, its results unavailable for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death which sent the Newark police a sorrow through the Führungspitze.
.
"It was loyal, hard working and stubborn", said in a telephone interview on Wednesday lord McCarthy of Ms. Arroyo.
"It was my Pitbull."
Her protected mich."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the woman of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newarker police civil servants who works for the Alkoholkontrollkomission and that it leaves behind two sons, 14 and 11 and a step daughter.
.
"That is one of the possibilities", Ms. Walsh said.
"It is a running investigation."
Arrived the authorities are said it at the house at approximately 3 time nachmittags in November.
And they found Ms. Arroyo on a sofa.
It was explained on site for death.
More than one week passed and the authorities communicated little over their investigation or owner of the house which is listed over the one as a gauze Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Ms. Castro was asked by the authorities.
Attempt the investigators to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door in Ms. Castros house where a rose shrub that wilted is in the brief Vorgarten and a Dalmatiner barks behind the house.
A blue barrel inscribes with "Ethyl vanillin" - uses as a substitute for vanilla in foods and Parfums - sat in the parking lot next to a door which led into the Untergeschoss.

"It was always here when I arrived here and it was always here when I went."
It was peinlich."
Hopes that the central banks the interests the Weltaktienmärkte will reduce leads to the rise
The shares jumped yesterday on both sides of the Atlantic after market hopes that the central bank will attempt to calm the credit markets by further interest lowerings, was strengthened by soothing commentaries by vice-chairmen of the US central bank.
The share markets rose in London, New York and in the whole of Europe after Donald barge, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, said that the policy must react "flexibly and pragmatic" to the continuous pressure on the finance markets.
To calm markets vexed in a clear effort, in the light of sign of rising credit tensions, the most recent turbulences would "partly have reversed some of the improvements in the market functions" Kohn said "from the late part of the September and October".
If the increased turbulence exists remains, it increased the possibility of a further increase of the financial conditions of consumers and enterprises, he said.
The commentaries were taken up by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to intervene and to stabilize the credit conditions with new capital injections in the US markets and possible further interest lowerings.
.
The consequences of the financial turbulences became by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investmentbank, emphasized that it will remove 650 jobs or 4 percent of their world-wide employees, in a measure for the cost reduction in order to cover serious losses from their lost bets in the US Hypothekenkreditesektor.
It is expected that only 20 of these places in London will disappear where the bank 1.500 staff member employs.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry index jumped about 331 points or 2,55 percent, to close in the case of 13.289,40, climbed while the breiter invested S&P 500 index about 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased about 165,5 points or 2,7 percent, to close in the case of 6.306,2, which more than 39 billion pounds added to the value of British standard values.
Climbed Germany index Dax about 2,6 percent and rose France CAC40 about 2,3 percent.
.
To follow the pressure the bank from England, the US central bank and the European central bank and to input further capital means in the money markets in London, rose, the credit tensions of the three-month "Libor installment" saw rise as one for lending between UK banks with 6,59 percent on her most highest since the late September, after a continuous increase since the 21. November.
England confronts with decision on the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here two dilemmas, each from that almost just as difficult as the other one.
Who should hit as a number 6 for England in Kandy on this week-end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, who should the decision not make less relevantly in a wider context than the first test against Sri Lanka?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the electoral chairman are, upon call at least under this special title, here Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan to help to decide about the leader trainer and because the table of High Morries, the English business-running director fills gradually, with applications for national voter offices, if even for which one in part time.
The one who does not even always get the sixth bat position will be unhappy but the life often is unjust and it is the sport doubtless.
It is never simple to nail exactly, make possible reach which the point of its job branch all person, while someone else over the lowest rank hinauskommt, sometimes due to lack of luck instead of capability.
Where judgements it are are not only necessary in the Kricket where the selection is difficult which is always in the end subjectively.
Is it to be risen the correct time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
The same can be asked perhaps also in a further area whether for example John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young managers with good conclusions which know the business well should be promoted.
Who can say what is the correct class for a Kricketspieler unless, him is provided with the possibility to swim or to go down.
Obviously numbers have a great influence on decisions, but chances also have this.
Within a team, a Kricketspieler must catch the eye of the captain at the correct time if he can take a Wicket and a bat must obtain regular chances on the order if he wants to make as a one-day Kricketspieler impression.
To catch the eyes of the Auswähler is more complicated.
There was many this better in the last season than, for example, were as a James Anderson who will apparently play in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares itself healthy and as the wind bowls in the networks.
Anderson took away 32 prime Wickets per 33 Runs in order to earn a position in this revolution.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had its glitter points and hopes for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara play in the Asgiriya stage can be only a view question.
The choice could decide both men's careers or it perhaps however makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and was successful in the first Runs useful with five Wickets and 40, Paul Collingwood was however to be strengthened, then still fight for who created the breakthrough to a significant Testkricketspieler and this although he dotted hundred against one double Australias in Australia, still is perhaps underestimated.
It is probable that Graveney, Vaughan will follow their conservative instincts and stomach feelings for Shahs greater experience youthful enthusiasm, after a further discussion in the course of today's network meeting in the Asgiriya stage via Boparas and of moorland.
There are arguments for.
.
However Shah made only ten Runs in its two Innings in the May toward west Indies in the test in Lord, its homeland arena as a player from Middlesex this plus its instantaneous rejection of the Auswählern as Vaughan healthfully was in order to cancel its position for the next play, appears to have taken the swing from its hitting, this still in Bombay obvious was.
The all expert from Essex shovel wise life pleasure by contrast has.
.
He suffered smaller injuries and supposedly a shock, but the first thing, which he did was to be taken out its Vodafone (natural also gesponsort) and called its team colleague Alastair Cook who had observed this from the distance and to say with enthusiasm: "You saw that".
Bopara is a much better field player, he bowls here on the play fields, which appears to go with him his medium pace with some effect and hits with confidence and destiny.
To choose the correct man is a thing another to choose the correct time.
That is perhaps real art of the selection.
I in addition incline to provide Bopara its chance now, which does not mean that Shah will not perhaps however stand there well if, as the tea sentence from Ceylon suggests he is that who will play this week-end here.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
The first bus loadings of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad yesterday, with a current of sold whose money means or Visas flowed out and hoped other this that the city returns to normality.
Some were even to fight returned about the rebels who had expelled them from their houses.
.
"I decided to go to Syria after they had killed many doctors in Bagdad", Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a sunnitischer doctor said.
"I returned today, because of that which I saw in the television and what I read in the newspaper over what occurred in Bagdad and as it would be now secure."
They say that the Mahdi army stopped killing people", his said, with regard to the Schiitenmilizen of the militanten clergyman Moqtada Al-Sadr who arranged to place his forces at the present time back."
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old shiite teacher from the predominant sunnitische part of Amariyah, returned its children with its both because he was not able to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime does not permit to work Iraqis.
Its shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him in order to tell him that a local militia supported by the USA contributed to expelling Al-Qaida from its bast ion in the west of the capital and having penetrated him to the return.
.
He returns in order to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they all began the antiAl Qaida militia in Sleikh and that they need my support and those of my boys."
Why that am returned I today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62."
Many told that they had been tempted by the increasing rest "citizen affected" in the capital since the US troop raise and the growth of local "groups" who arm and defend their districts in collaboration with the American soldier.
However more talked about having been compelled home by visa problems and drying up money means in Damaskus where more than 1,3 million Iraqis had fled in the last years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old triple father, expressed the general suspicion under the Exilanten that Nouri al-Maliki who had asked shiite minister-president, the Syrian government to impose visa limits for the refugees in order to compel people for the return.
More than two one half million persons fled supposedly of the sektiererischen death squadrons in the country.
"It went visited us well until al-Maliki Syria and to give the government drängte the Iraqis no further visas in order to compel them for the return into Iraq", sunnitischen pensioner said.
"I can not trust a government which supports the criminals, the house burned down after I went away."
A part of the reason for the drop in the force is that sunn hemp nits from shiite living areas and was sold converse, which led to producing many places where tensions decreased.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees sektiererische tensions will stir up again and conflicts will take place.
Small Saarland, good development
The smallest state is leading with the job training and shines even with the international orientation of its universities.
.
"I hab' yesterday the 50. time one of non-Saar countries declare that we are not Frenchmen" - the smallest state placards this slogan self-ironically for its 50. birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a large role in this in the educational system of the Saarland which is Cologne (IW) in the educational monitor of the institute of the German economy on place five.
Thus the universities already co-operate narrowly with the neighbor countries from tradition.
The university in Saarbru4cken was founded 1948 by the Frenchmen.
Until today, students can conclude here their study with a double or even triple diploma.
The share of foreign students with 15,6 percent is high accordingly.
However the Saarland in number above average brings even the state children to the universities - many to the high school of them without a conclusion.
"In the Saarland, one uses the professional educational system", tells Axel Plünnecke educational expert in the case of the IW.
More than every fifth youngster its study authorization acquires in a job school in order that the Saarland lies more than seven percentage points over the federal average.
Even the possibilities of combination of professional and academic training are expanded comparatively strongly.
Measured against population number the equipment with binary study procedures is this second best in Germany.
In spite of the practical training and increasing demand, the number of Ingenieurabsolventen however sank in the past years about a third.
Therefore the Saarland educational ministry committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineer scientific fields now.
"In the general formative schools, we activated a few reforms according to the first Pisa study", says a speaker of the educational ministry.
Thus the government introduced country-wide comparison tests.
In order that the children earlier the last Kita's learn to begin be free-of-charge - a model that even other states copy meanwhile.
Whether the performances of students nachhaltig better themselves, comparison studies future first will show.
In the case of Pisa 2003, the share of the risk students shrank from 29 to 20 percent.
Altogether the Saarland did not however increase as strongly as other states.
The Bavarians calculate better.
And to the Verdruss of the Saar countries, Fremdsprachenkenntnise is not measured at Pisa - in this area, one could otherwise dot.
For the language of the neighbors is duty in high schools - even if the Saar countries are not Frenchmen.
Chávez shifts the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks soon tick differently than in the remainder of the world.
On the 9. December, President Hugo Chávez has the time knives in the South American country turned back by a half hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes the joke figure meanwhile.
As Venezuela's office leaf communicated, the clocks are minus adjusted to a fixed world time according to a newest law four and a half hours.
Thus südamerikansiche state obtains a time zone which there is in no other country of the world.
The USA hostile Chávez justified its decision among other things by the United States of the world having imposed at full hours the division into time zones.
Moreover Chávez discontinued the discontinuance of the relations with the neighbor state of Columbia announce on Wednesday (place time) because of a hostage affair.
The left nationalist said as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Columbia remains, he is supported neither to the head of state nor to the Columbian government relations.
"I am not able to that alone because of my quite dignity", said Chávez which accelerates a constitutional reform over which the citizens of the oil country must vote on Sunday in a referendum.
With the reform, he would clearly expand his power in the country.
Release of the argument was went it in the case of these about the Freilassung of hostages decision Uribes to withhold Chávez the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Columbia.
Uribe "spat" Venezuela with its decision "into the face", Chávez had criticized on Sunday.
Chávez in all Munde is in Spain as well.
A new cell phone bell tone provides for Furore in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (you do not hold Warum the mouth) sounds the sentence that half million persons from the internet have already been downloaded more than one.
Of Spain King Juan Carlos who was on the youngest Iberoamerika summit of the constant interim calls of the Linkspopulisten genervt and had gone for this over the mouth spoke to him.
Germans threaten 2007 wage minuses
In spite of the strong economic situation, a real wage loss threatens German employees of a prognosis according to this year.
.
According to a calculation of the Hans Böckler foundation, the employed 2007 could calculate in real terms with less on the content account as in the previous year.
"The modest wage evolution, the value-added tax raise and the price pushes are guilty on that with foods and energy", Gustav horn of the institute for macro economy and economic situation research of the "picture newspaper" said.
New burdens could approach with the unemployed insurance as well employees.
Finance secretary Peer Steinbrück said for the "newest Osnabrueck newspaper", the planned Absenkung of the unemployed insurance is to be sure correct and rational on 3,3 percent to the turn of the year in the present situation.
However, the federal agency for work may not come into embarrassment again to have to ask for credits or allowances at the alliance, the SPD politician was quoted.
It had become known on Tuesday that the price explosion has driven the inflation rate for years with foods and crude oil products on the highest state for 13.
The prices altogether increased in comparison with the year about 3,0 percent.
Venus is höllische twin of earth
The Venus is more similar than to date thought in spite of its life hostile atmosphere of earth: The European space probe "Venus Express" discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind eddies on the poles how they appear in the winter on the earth as well.
Scientists have supposed for almost three decades that it flashes on the Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" produced the proof - it tracked down electromagnetic waves on the brink of the atmosphere: The lightnings on the Venus shoot 56 for kilometers of cloud in a height of round to cloud, report Christopher Russel about the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theory," lightnings had the life resulted on the earth: Thunderstorms must have encouraged in the ocean reactions which led to the development of Aminosäuren, the modules of the life.
Not so on the Venus: "If there were ever lives there, it must have been in the very early story", explains Sean Solomon by the Carnegie institution in Washington.
Today it on the surface of the Venus scarcely might give something lively: The atmosphere is one around hundred times denser than on the earth, there reign temperatures of 500 degree now and then.
"The Venus is perhaps the devil twin of earth, but it is a twin", Russel said.
.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for the Venus research as, since the beginning of the neunziger years, no more probe has specially been for investigating this planet on the way.
The most recent research results which are now presented in several "Nature articles" not only emphasize the single good behavior of the Venus within the sun system according to the researchers.
"They also show that the common grounds of our neighbor planet with the earth are first larger assumed", the Esa communicates.
Thus the researchers found a cloud swirl as well next to the eddy wind well-known already at the North Pole at the South Pole which still turns fundamentally more quickly.
The phenomenon reminds of air currents on the earthly winter hemisphere, circumscribes a researcher team Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet of the sun system has almost the same mass such as the earth and is almost just as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet described as morning or evening star also revolves 225 for days around the sun in scarce.
But he concerns a lot slowly himself: A Venustag lasts 243 earth days.
Although the Venus reminds with surface temperatures of 460 degree of Celsiuses and a pressure of 92 bar scarcely on the earth, scientists assume that both planets developed under completely similar requirements.
In both, water collected which remained on the earth in oceans, on whose Venus was however lost into the area.
And while coal dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonate rocks, it turns off the major part of the atmosphere on the Venus.
Charcoal-burner defends Merkels for hits with the Dalai lama
.
He criticized the SPD chancellor indirectly because of their attacks on these after the meeting in September.
President of the Federal Council base charcoal-burner worries about the reputation of Germany and asked the large coalition to conclude the fight about the reception of the Dalai lama.
"We should present no split nation to the outside world in this question", said charcoal-burners for the trade leaf.
At the same time signaled charcoal-burners understanding of the reception of the Dalai lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"The human rights have for me universal validity even if I have respect for the diversity of the cultures", said charcoal-burners.
Each knows that Germany must protect sensitive balances in the foreign policy, the President of the Federal Council emphasized but took Merkel before the accusation in protection, it pursues a new China policy.
"This Chancellor did not take interval by the traditional one-China policy."
That knows China", said charcoal-burners as well."
Foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had revealed indirectly displeasure on the reception of the Dalai lama and had therefore been attacked from series of the union.
Steinmeier had complained the "display window policy" of the union among other things in the foreign policy.
After receiving the Dalai lama in the chancellor office, violent Irritationen took place in the German Chinese relationship.
Thus the Chinese direction not only unloaded the German finance secretary Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but rather according to information of the MIRRORS, froze the so-called strategic dialog of the Foreign Ministries of both countries as well.
.
China rejects it if European politicians receive the religious leader the Tibeter in official function, confirmed Wen Jiabao the Chinese position.
The acts and words of the Dalai lama showed that it attempts to split off Tibet and the further tibetische region which includes other today's provinces as well from China.
Schäuble warnt before riots such as in France
Road battles with the police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warnt before riots such as in France.
Everything has to be done, in order that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not discharge in force on the road, the Federal Interior Minister demanded.
Barricades burned, Randalierer shot the police with coarse meal shot guns: After the severe youth riots in France, Federal Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We must ensure that does not build up even with explosive social us and discharges himself in force."
We must take that seriously", he told the" new press "appearing in Hanover."
Not every young person manages well with the quick change of the social reality.
Alliance, countries and municipalities already worked with emphasis on decreasing problems, Schäuble said.
That not only affects the integration of Migranten.
"Of the integration summit up to the Islam conference, that already shows first successes."
For Entwarnung, it is however too early.
Schäuble pointed out at the same time that there are not town architectural and sociological problems in German suburbs as in France.
In northern suburbs from Paris, youngsters had delivered themselves in the past nights difficult road battles with the police.
In Toulouse as well, cars and public buildings burned.
The chairman of the Turkish local authority in Germany demanded greater integration efforts of the Federal Government meanwhile, Kenan colature.
In the light of the riots in France warnte colature before "imitation securities".
The situation in Germany is not to be sure as high-explosive as in France.
There is however nevertheless commercial requirement.
Colature referred to this that the unemployment rate is in the case of youngster with migration background under 25 years "above the average high".
One must provide above all for more training places.
Colature emphasized: "We must provide the youngsters with a perspective."
The chairman the Turkish local authority however added takes place in Germany more than in France "a social control in the families".
Many youngsters with migration background did not moreover want to destroy that, which their parents set up here.
Colature reminded: "However in spite of this we must watch out."
One must "provide" the youngsters "quickly with the possibility of participating at work and training".
Unterdessen remained it Villiers le bel largely quiet in the night in the Paris suburb.
Hundertschaften were in operation for the police, a helicopter flew over the area with headlights.
The responsible authorities reported three Festnahmen as well as a couple of burning garbage buckets and cars.
Since the Vortag, a levy of round one has provided 1000 for security forces for rest.
The police becomes takes action announced Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie so long as it is necessary after a visit in the suburb.
In the night on Tuesday, 80 policemen had been injured around with riots in Villiers le bels.
In the resultant night, the unrests encroached on Toulouse.
The riots ignited from a traffic accident with which two youngsters had lost the life on Sunday.
According to first realizations of the state legal profession, the police assumes no guilty of the youngsters' death.
In the empire of Angela cloud
The reality remote appearance the chancellor documents that the coalition is in the end in substance - and that nothing is to be more expected by her.
In what country does Chancellor live this really?
After their disconsolate appearance in the general debate of the German Federal Parliament which was wurschtig and contents poor one must say: not here - not in the country which would finally have to be ruled by her.
Angela Merkel rejected with a badly overbearing sentence the accusation that it too very concentrates on the foreign policy.
That is provincial, said it and thus showed first that it does not want to comprehend of what it is a matter for the critics.
In the German Federal Parliament, it documented recognizable for all as their accusation is very true.
Neither concrete interest was present nor to feel gar a feelings for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela cloud presented itself: a lifted up politician who flees into the foreign policy and remains there in the approximate one herself.
Example climate protection: There it praises ungebremst for the decisions of holy dam but does not say as the climate objectives should be reached in this country.
At all, the self-praise - so much Unbescheidenheit would still have failed the CDU Chefin for itself two years ago.
Now it clings to the Floskel that the lift succeeds with the persons.
Thus it damages its image as a Pragmatikerin which solves problems instead of the world nice encourages.
.
Child poverty and the worries of the low wage-earners?
It for that has a couple of additional sentences remaining.
Is calling as it often misspeaks when it is a matter of the child surcharge.
Merkel there needs three starts in order to bring out halfway a geraden sentence.
It stumbles as on foreign terrain if it becomes concrete.
Department attack
.
The exertion of the candidates already discharges in the case of the first subject.
He changed New York into a "refuge place for illegal immigrants", reproaches Mitt Romney his contractors Rudy Giuliani.
This counters for its part with difficult accusations: "I would say that its own house was a port for illegal" one, replies Giuliani and accuses the former governor of Massachusetts of having employed immigrants privately without papers.
The candidates blow for the attack: Because the republican basis continues to have no clear favorite, the eight presidency applicants above all use the debate on CNN in order to discredit its Widersacher.
The self-turned 30 second Videos which sent in Internetnutzer via Youtube are scarcely more than keyword givers.
.
.
The reactions of the hall public show that the important subjects of the campaign however lie meanwhile on the other side of Iraq war and torture debates in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases rejected, approval surges on in the auditorium.
Becomes evident with this once more where in the two favorites' weaknesses lie.
"I erred myself then", explained Romney zerknirscht and for that do apology before basis and television public that he still belonged 1994 to the abortion advocates.
Giuliani by contrast comes into the Schlingern when he is asked for the literal interpretation of the Bible in its opinion.
Musharraf rules for the first time to civvies
.
Thus eight years end up soldier control in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in on Thursday for a further five-year period in office.
The Pakistani television transferred live the ceremony in the President palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the state and to act it to the nation's welfare.
.
.
With its resignation as Oberbefehleshaber of the armed forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of the opposition and the west.
.
Already soon after its swearing in, Musharraf will cancel Qayyum the exceptional status according to general state attorney Malik Muhammad and thus meet a further requirement of the west.
The uppermost court of justice of the country that Musharraf had occupied weighed lawyer after imposing the exceptional status at the beginning of November with him had rejected all objections the head of state in the past week against the disputed re-election on the 6. October.

The fathers the plant skirts return
Germany's super group of the seventies makes music again: The three band members of Harmonia planned their consoles with a concert in Berlin again.
To the Revival, a Mitschnitt from their large time "live 1974" appears.
They were already fundamentally more famous then abroad.
The scheduled sensation then happens in shape of three set gentlemen at the evening board.
Each has his box before himself, its cables and above all its buttons.
Dieter Moebius thront in the blossom white shirt in 63 years in the middle.
To the left of 57 years flank young and in the possession of Laptop and guitar by Michael Rother.
To the right, looks at from auditorium, Hans Joachim Roedelius, 73 bends, concentrated at the console.
Each contributes noises, now and then even a Beat.
And sometimes, it adds music to itself inadvertently to a conventional piece.
That appears not then to disturb even the gentlemen himself.
That the band Harmonia makes music again ensured among plant skirt lovers some excitement.
In which case one may uncover here: Aimed demands showed that the name to be sure whirred through the collective pop memory but to miss according to nachhaltig about this band by no means for 32 years schmerzlich.
However why should even the German not celebrate his existing legends from the seventy years?
Especially since what is called misleadingly plant skirt was always more valid in England and America than in its own country.
When the music economy awarded the that survive of the Cologne group Can 2003 the echo prize for the life plant, one saw in the hall in questioning German pop faces.
When! also thanked the Red Hot Chili Peppers newly in the Laudatio the bands La Du4sseldorfs and, the astonishment knew no borders.
.
The problem of the ignorance at home and the transfiguration in the stranger is that one.
The memory is already therefore overtaxed with Harmonia because the trio unfolded only two years a far smaller effect power as well existed and in this time than one allocated to them subsequently by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already made music clusters with the artist Conrad Schnitzler previously under the a lot promising name.
First, one played in the cellar under the Berlin stage.
After that, for on in Du4sseldorf, for economic reasons from the church supported Plattenlabel.
Rother had helped out briefly in power station and then! as a Gitarrist in the case of new, the then perhaps most radical German group, a call erspielt.
Rother however followed the cluster musicians in the exile about 1973 following forest in the Weserbergland.
They lived there, in the altos Weserhof, a ruin from the 16. century, as a city fleeting Kommunarden.
Less ideologically as in the municipality I where Roedelius was still allowed to be tormented as a nanny.
Rather in spitzweghaftem artist present.
Supposedly a pennant of the song organization Harmonia Ottenstein was also found in the bar garbage and for art a name.
Some recorded Harmonia from that.
The first album was called "music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
For like that left and also summon sounded music that band suffered material need.
The Selbstfindung did not serve the brushwood collection only.
The CD "live 1974" appeared now was recorded with a concert in Griessem, 50-köpfigen record wings before one barely as someone believes to be remembered.
The wish came from Rother then to force Harmonia and to practise it occasionally.
.
The band explained 1975 their separation.
Rother landed in the Esoterisch spherical one and secured itself its existence with albums such as "blazing heart".
Cluster was revived in the eighties and has been more successful since then than Harmonia was ever.
The Griessemer live album is to be owed Herbert Grönemeyer.
.
Newly! dug already became as Roedelius solo plant.
The physical Wiederauferstehung of Harmonia takes place in the Berlin house of the cultures of the world.
Subsidizes publicly, in the context of festival Woldtronics.
Julian Cope is there, the Briton, old punk and author of the reference manual "plant skirt samplers".
Dr. moth Loveparade inventor is also present.
With which the entire band width of the influences of the plant skirt on following pop music would be outlined.
Of Harmonia, the blank of the super group is filled out.
The sentence of Brian Eno hovers with the most peculiar Sounds in the hall: "Solely true music, the future belongs to her."
There are pictures which show the producers with Harmonia in the farmer room.
Projection of further black and white photos of wirr wired up equipment serve for the putting final development for wired up equipment.
In front of that, the three veterans are concerned with the improvisation again.
No longer by adhering microphones to the organ and to the blow stuff in order to elicit from the instruments via unerhörte even built effect devices tones.
Electronic music such as electronic music appears today.
Three in the technical deepened Tüftler.
The chorus of the house also alters nothing in this.
Under line Barbara morning star one coughs under Soundwolken and whispered and sung at a well place with emphasis "Aaaaaaaah!".
Plant skirt was always yes a very English concept.
It never concerned skirt.
The roots were searched for less in blues, as in music universities (Can), technologies (power station), fleeing or before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
The one who "calls '68!"" here does not "have quite unjustly and Harmonia can not from that be brought even now from the rest."
The most obvious one is still thought over thoroughly at the arena.
Where does music begin and does when it stop?
That can rob the nerves for one or give presents fleeting moments of great luck.
Richard Gere is not cynical enough simply
Again two films with the Balkans war occupy themselves with "The Hunting party" and "murrderous peace".
However do not both convince.
Either the concepts set to Action too much and Geballer or else they are too stirring blessed.
There even Richard Gere can not help in "The Hunting party".
The good report at first: To be sure the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic still hide in the mountains of the Balkans, however calculated there, in the gloomy rear country of the Bosnia war, the actor Richard Gere was now found again.
We had lost the nicest man of the eighty years finally from the eyes because all too many kind unimportant roles drove from one in well feeling films for women and all too many press conferences on the subject Buddhism as if desire for looking at.
Now Richard Gere is sudden the most important argument, "The Hunting party - Wenn the hunter" perhaps however "becomes" to look at (film titles must be Warum really always so long today and wirr as locomotive leader tariff contracts) "to the hunted".
.
However in spite of this Trumpfes, "The Hunting party" continues only the endless series of failed Balkans war films together with the German production of "murrderous peaces" which start in this week as well.
With "murrderous peace," one can make short process: The film deals with two German soldiers in the Kosovo (Adrian Topol, max. Riemelt) which saves a Serbian from kosovarischen snipers, would which this also still falls in love one with them promptly.
.
It however for that remains a type of "alarm for Cobra 11" without highway with war.
On the other hand, can be investigated exemplarily at "The Hunting party" absolutely why there was never yet a correctly good Balkans war film really.
The story of three US war reporters who set out in order to track down the Serbian upper war criminal "the fox" could perhaps have become a new "Apocalypse Now" another time with another director and another Drehbuchautor (both in personnel union Richard Shepard).
For the Storys are alike yes frappierend: Small teams go both times into the forest in order to accomplish something, which the soldiers and for both times it becomes a journey into the insanity.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting party" is that one is not Simon Hunt not simply the descended cynic with heart, he we are presented as this at the beginning.
No, the Script must attribute obendrein to him another romantic affair with a muslimischen Bosnian murdered later.
Finally "The Hunting party" goes the brook runter at the time when is successful for the reporters within the last five minutes in the Zeitrafferverfahren that, which Nato, CIA and all head money hunter of the world did not manage in five years: Catch the war criminal and leave the muslimischen Bosnians him for the just revenge.
That is so bad that one would like to call the international court of justice in the Haag because of crimes against movie theater logic.
The film has a deeply human request.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic still rum run freely and he suspects the Americans and not to operate the Frenchmen (they should times be united here as an exception) the pursuit all too intensively as a result of secret political agreements.
However the well meant and the bad one are sometimes so similar to himself that a famous Brecht poem comes for one into the sense.
.
Films such as "The Hunting party" have exactly such swelling heads which however indicate how exerting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of Balkans war film.
Become is reports recently in this newspaper that all Iraq films were Hollywoods large Flops.
One can add: There was never yet as well a good South Africa film.
Is almost always valid: If a cataract is hung around on the crisis ranges or mine fields of the world, then something like that as goes "Rangoon" this out with Patricia Arquette, "beyond of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly, all the conflicts are still too specific simply within a given time.
Decades in any case had to pass it before Hollywood with "Schindlers list" was able to shoot a good film via the Holocaust.
Some film will probably still ripen - the Vietnam plants "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal suit coat" considered a classic author now were celebrated seinerzeit of yes by no means einhellig as masterpieces.
However perhaps we know today where every mass murder in real-time comes two screens to immediately home, also simple too much over the conflicts of the world.
And that robs the Drehbuchschreibern the Bedenkenlosigkeit which needs it in order to tell good stories.
"Are or nothingness" or "the large dictator" finally therefore as well became yes so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how badly the Nazi regime reigned really.
Perhaps, one may not be if one wants to make good films.
Perhaps, one must have the sarkastisch disassociated artist look of the Romanciers Lawrence Norfolk.
When this was asked for "dictionary" and the Balkans war to parallels between its historical novel "Lemprières", he answered: "That is only because some things never change."
Cities will always be awfully dangerous, people will always be murdered in ghastly way and war in Yugoslavia herrschen." always becomes
Of Beust, criticism reaps of Olympic cancellation
The moving away of the mayor from the application of Hamburg for Olympische summer plays came upon violent criticism with policy and economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the plays at the water.
However of Beust, realism sends a reminder when rating the chances.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Commerce's main general managers' Hamburg, Hans Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a renunciation as "not good for the economic location".
No other project unfolded lately so large motivation forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"Without this objective, the sport political swing could not be upheld in the same measure."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the senate not to bury the project but rather to find a new long-term approach for that "who comes from a changed time line".
Mayor Ole of Beust kept on Wednesday to earlier statements according to which Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are at least up to year 2028 unrealistisch.
.
.
"This preference means to us that we will have of us angedachten period no realistic chances in that up to now until 2028."
Nevertheless, the dream is not ausgeträumt forever, said by Beust.
The Hamburg sport club (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
By this means the impression is waked that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for years in the next 25 for Olympische plays.
"It is too early to obstruct a chance for himself by already burying the plans at this time", told HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A renunciation of the application is moreover for the full assembly of the general German university sport association in the conflict with the statement of the senate leader on the occasion of a reception.
There the application of Hamburg for the Universiade 2015 "not as a substitute" for Olympische plays in Hamburg called of Beust.
.
The SPD citizenry fraction accused the senate of not having used valuable time for the house construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the small Grasbrooks was delayed by the senate for years because he put on ticket Olympia and excluded the house construction", the SPD representatives Carola Veit and Jan brush said.
.
The application for the Olympischen summer plays 2012 had initiated a great enthusiasm in Hamburg seinerzeit.
Hamburg had however been defeated by Leipzig.
These are not Warhols crates
The one who combines the concepts Sweden and wood crate thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or however?
Currently manufactured wood crates throw dark shadows at Warhols plant catalogue in Sweden.
A major part of the ninety-four Brillo boxes listed there of the "type Stockholm" is forgeries.
After the Swedish newspaper "ex-presses" stirred up doubts as to the authenticity of Andy Warhols Brillo boxes of year 1968 some months ago, internal inquiries come in the Moderna Museet in Stockholm now to a sobering up result: The six "Brillo Boxes" that the former museum director Pontus Hultén bequeathed the Moderna Museet 1995 as a donation are copies - and even the major part probably this for one around hundred other Brillo boxes of the "type Stockholm" which are on the international art market in circulation.
The history is interlocked, a confusing chain artistic and kuratorischer productions.
1964 created Warhol its first "Brillo Boxes", painted wood crates which are based on the red blue white design of the paste boxes of soap powder "Brillo" in New York.
.
It concerned not works of art but rather their models, bare exhibition pieces.
At the same time Warhol 1968 probably the permission gave to have some produced few Brillo wood crates in Sweden which was not however displayed in the Moderna Museet.
.
Some of them achieved on auctions more than 100 000 dollar.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén asserted later falsely that 1968 one around hundred wood crates in Sweden was produced and displayed which then left him Warhol.
.
At this time Warhol has been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, leader curator at the Moderna Museet, investigated along with the six museum own Brillo Boxes even three from Swedish private possession of which two 1968 were manufactured in Stockholm: Your pressing chipboards were primed and ground first, white oil color with a brush was served.
.
"These crates were authorized by the artist and from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes one removes", the director of the Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve, are reported: "If the 'Andy Warhol type Authentication Board' in New York does not come for another end, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates as a copy material in its collection."
Already in July admittedly the Authentication Board announced to follow the "difficult accusations" which are raised to matters of the soap powder crates.
However since then, one has wrapped him there in unerbittliches silent.
Rebelling soldiers in Manila give up
On the Filipino rebelling soldiers gave up who fortified in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He can answer for no blood spilling, leader told reporters in the hotel Antonio Trillanes which reproached the President corruption and electoral deception.
Government faithfulness soldier had stormed the hotel previously under tear gas use.
The around two dutzend soldiers had taken shelter for hours in the building.
On Thursday round half of them was in year 2003 because of a coup attempt that failed before the court - Trillanes among them.
He used the negotiation in order to deposit 30 Sympathisanten suddenly with round.
The soldier policemen who should actually guard him had evidently run over for him too and joined with its mutiny.
They penetrated into the Peninsula hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops closed off the region about the distinguished hotel.
.
The national security adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' procedure.
"The people enough have", said Trillanes.
"We call up people to join with us."
General Danilo Lim who commanded the elite unit of the Scout Rangers earlier said that other army units wanted to join with the march shortly.
Government critics had called up for great demonstrations against the President for Friday.
Your government has been overshadowed for months of corruption accusations.
Manila's finance district was already 2003 main show place of the attempted mutiny of round 200 soldier affiliated against Arroyo.
The rebellion was defeated following scarce 24 hours by the refusal of the army to follow.
Since 1986, there have already been at least seven coup attempts on the Filipino against democratically chosen governments.
